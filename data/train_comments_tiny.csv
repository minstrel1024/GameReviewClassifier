1,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ShortRaver/recommended/207610,ShortRaver,207610,THE WALKING DEAD is perhaps of one the best storytelling pieces I 've played in a long time . Separated into 5 episodes , each one offers you a chance to make personal choices which in the end , impact on the outcome of the rest of the game . Worthy of it 's 2012 Game of the Year wins , THE WALKING DEAD is a must-play game for all .
2,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hiperdrive/recommended/599960,hiperdrive,599960,This game was good ... although it seems " half bad done " , it has certain charm , and I like it someway . It has enough things inside the game itself , which does not end up making him so boring (like a lot of mini-games and ways to go ). The dialogues , the places and the randomization in general , it is quite cool in some way , the duration of the game is good , for the type of game , since there are so many games in the steam that are crap and they are still short . >>>On the other hand ... The generic sounds are annoying and the music is pretty standard , presents poor controls and game itself is poorly polished (perhaps because of the limitation of the engine used ). A tip for the developer : when recording a sound , try not to record the sound with the fan on , or simply edit your sound in some way so as not to have the irritant wind noise . Thanks ,

7,1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052234251/recommended/48700,76561198052234251,48700,Hello fellow gamer , So I been playing this game for a while now and would like to give a feed back and say what I think about this game . First of all in general this is a very good game with hours of fun . If you can get it while there is a discount definitly buy it . But now lets come to the bugs and stupid things about the game , to be honoest this is the reason I am writing this review . - some quests are annoying as hell , like trying to find the bandit camps quests , or worst quests ever is trying to rescue a prisoner . In order to rescue a prisoner you can do three thing ; 1st go takeover the castle , 2nd find someone with connections to the castle your prisoner is being held . (have never seen anyone doing it this way ) and the 3rd way is going to the village associated with the castle and asking the village leader to set fire which you pay him 200golds then you can sneak in to the castle , this way you shouldb e only fighting the prison guard but nope I keep fighting the hall castle still . - when you are asked to collect a tax from a village or deliver a message to someone they are almost always on the other side off the world (map) - when you start the game it is a bit too hard even with easy setting . hard to level your troops , raise gold , buy armor &weapon and later on when you have a strong troop , which you get around day 100-150 generaly , then the game gets way to easy . (with my 100 troops I win againts a hall kingdom (100 vs 700-900 troops ) without even loosing a single soldier . At one point I had like 10-12 counts ,lords and their king as my prisoner , no one left to pay their ransom in their kingdom :) - Game constantly crashes like every couple of hours . So I am quick saving like every 5-10 minutes :( I am playing on a mac but the got the game directly from steam and it is a mac version so not sure how it plays on a pc . Anyhow in general I would give this game 4 out of 5.
