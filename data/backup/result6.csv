In short: The Witcher 3 is amazing. It's an incredible achievement in gaming.   do yourself a favor. Play it.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mr_Emoji/recommended/413150,1, Definitely a game I would recomend to those who have a lot of free time on their hands and love simulator games. Between farming, mining, and getting to know the villagers one can rarely get bored. Considering the game is made by one person it is a pretty well rounded game that is witty and unpredictable. Love it!! so 10/10  do yourself a favor. Play it.  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/SgtWaffles/recommended/17410,1, This game is actually stunning. So much so, that I find myself reinstalling and playing through it every so often. It's pretty short, &lt;10 hours I'd say, but it's ridiculously unique. The artstyle is breathtaking and the soundtrack/audio is really good. If you are looking for a unique experience, buy this game. I can't recommend it enough. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mr_Emoji/recommended/264710,1, It is fun, challenging, and at some points scary. It was worth the money. Can't wait to see future updates... 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/2255654574454245/recommended/105600,1, nice game

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mr_Emoji/recommended/696790,1, if you are a &quot;COD FAN&quot; you will feel right at home with COD WW2!! i am . and i really enjoyed it! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/SgtWaffles/recommended/707300,1, Honestly... I bought this as a meme, but it's surprsingly a lot of fun. I can't overstate how good it feels when you trigger the haptic feedback upon hitting a note. It's addictive. I do wish that there were more songs, even a workshop maybe (asking for a lot with that one though).    The Good: ======== + Fun gameplay, generally feels good + Easy to pickup + Doesn't require a massive play space to enjoy + Miku  + Motions are kinda cool  The Bad: ======= - Fairly expensive, difficult to justify - Only 8 songs (16 maps, one per each difficulty) - Hard isn't really that much more challenging - UI is pretty meh  Not regretting my purchase (on sale to be fair), but here's to hoping they add more songs.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/SgtWaffles/recommended/282800,1, This game is often mistaken for a game of pure chance, but what people don't seem to realize is that it is infact 100% skill. It has, albeit arguably, the same depth as chess does. I've played this game for a little bit now, yet I haven't even scratched the surface of the level of complexity the game has to offer.  I've heard rumours about pros taking years and years to master this game. 10/10.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/SgtWaffles/recommended/406150,1, Short and sweet A E S T H E T I C parkour game. Soundtrack definitely stood out, as it is fantastic. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/SgtWaffles/recommended/720280,-1, The Good: ======= + The art is super cute (Dat Live2D tho) + OST is good + UI is clean and fluid + Cheap  The Bad: ====== - Painfully bad translations. (&quot;Since I cried so server that time, how were I cured? HOW WERE I CURED&quot;)  - Options for auto-play lacking, it's sooo slow even set to max speed ( 25 char/s). I read faster than a 4th grader thanks.   Honestly, if you can handle the god-awful translations, it's probably worth it for the low price. For me, they ruined it which is why I can't recommend it.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/SgtWaffles/recommended/292030,1, Amazing card game with a pretty good rpg mini-game attached. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/SgtWaffles/recommended/311870,1, Fantastic game, except for the stupid ????ing point and click sequences. That has to be the most ridiculously stupid mechanic they could have added to the game. It's uneccesary and frustrating... Apart from that, great music, great art direction,  great humour.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/SgtWaffles/recommended/758230,1, Early Release? A Christmas Miracle. Shoutout to Tokyo Otaku Mode for messing up and shipping early.   The Good: ======== + Solid animation, didn't seem like they cut corners. + Voice acting is top-tier, as expected. + :3 Kawaii af teehee xd  + Vanilla and Coconatsu  The Bad: ======= - Expensive for 1 hour video  - Azuki - [Joke about getting diabetes]  A bit pricey overall at ~30$, but I guess that's about what we'll pay to get our sweaty hands on more Nekopara. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Iwannabeyalover/recommended/104200,1, Beep Beep and i got some cards XDXD 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/SgtWaffles/recommended/253230,1, The Good: ======== + Fantastic, unique artstyle. + Hilarious dialogue and storyline . + Outstanding Soundtrack (Seriously, it's soo good). + Honestly, near-perfect gameplay with fun non-frustrating mechanics. + Hat Kid is a beautiful cinnamon bun to pure for this world. + Workshop support for custom levels. + Old-school, fun achievements.  The Bad: ======= - It ended :(  Just buy this game, it's like all that N64 nostalgia feel packaged into a cute, hilarious platformer. I Kickstarted it 3 years ago, hyped since and it still managed to blow away my expectations. I can say without a doubt that it's a serious contender for my GOTY 2017. It took about 12 hours to 100% complete, which may seem a bit short, but every minute of it was enjoyable. Serious &quot;hats off&quot; to the dev team :)

https://steamcommunity.com/id/SgtWaffles/recommended/707300,1, Honestly... I bought this as a meme, but it's surprsingly a lot of fun. I can't overstate how good it feels when you trigger the haptic feedback upon hitting a note. It's addictive. I do wish that there were more songs, even a workshop maybe (asking for a lot with that one though).    The Good: ======== + Fun gameplay, generally feels good + Easy to pickup + Doesn't require a massive play space to enjoy + Miku  + Motions are kinda cool  The Bad: ======= - Fairly expensive, difficult to justify - Only 8 songs (16 maps, one per each difficulty) - Hard isn't really that much more challenging - UI is pretty meh  Not regretting my purchase (on sale to be fair), but here's to hoping they add more songs.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/petskuletsku/recommended/717690,1, Took 11 hours to complete the 1st season on normal difficulties so not worth the 50¢ã at the current state. Trying to complete all mission on higher difficulties is hard since cant find any players for them. Gameplay itself is pretty good and fun.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/SgtWaffles/recommended/282800,1, This game is often mistaken for a game of pure chance, but what people don't seem to realize is that it is infact 100% skill. It has, albeit arguably, the same depth as chess does. I've played this game for a little bit now, yet I haven't even scratched the surface of the level of complexity the game has to offer.  I've heard rumours about pros taking years and years to master this game. 10/10.

I read faster than a 4th grader thanks.   Honestly, if you can handle the god-awful translations, it's probably worth it for the low price. For me, they ruined it which is why I can't recommend it.

The Bad: ======= - It ended :(  Just buy this game, it's like all that N64 nostalgia feel packaged into a cute, hilarious platformer. I Kickstarted it 3 years ago, hyped since and it still managed to blow away my expectations. I can say without a doubt that it's a serious contender for my GOTY 2017. It took about 12 hours to 100% complete, which may seem a bit short, but every minute of it was enjoyable. Serious &quot;hats off&quot; to the dev team :)

The jumpscares was uncalled for imo. For me, it was a really sharp turn when the beauty switches into some torso popping in and the audio makes your heart skip a beat.  Only buy it if you really want to try it, the price isn't worth it at the moment.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/eyeway/recommended/804320,1, Solid 8 minute short of adaptation from the game &quot;Papers, Please&quot; video game.  Quality's great like every other short films I've ever seen that are great too.  I think many can relate on how the movie takes turn to things that we won't mostly do in the game. That's what made me peeved during the entire movie, but that doesn't mean the movie reduced in quality whatsoever. Definitely worth for they who played the game before or they who don't really care about spoilers and wanted to see how they pull it off on this short. Not recommended for those who haven't and wants to experience the game and doesn't want to be spoiled.  Glory to Arstotzka!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/eyeway/recommended/253230,1, When I saw this game at Kickstarter while browsing bad video games funding, I feel helpless because I'm a lot younger in 2015 and can't donate anything besides greenliting it on Steam Greenlight (now dead) and spread the word in some small group in Steam.  First, I have mixed feelings about the game back at beta. I saw it in their website of some screenshots and short vids. &quot;These guys are new to this and this can either be good or bad.&quot; Well, I'm now positive that this game is going to make me spend time (mostly for screenshots maybe) because the first 5 hours already gave me many good contents.  Overall, game's good if you're into 3D platformers like Psychonauts and such, but don't get it if you dislike collecting random stuff because that's what this game kinda about. Bosses (first one, at least) is fine, not too hard, not too easy. Unlike the recent game where you play as a debt collector who works for the devil ;) 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/eyeway/recommended/476650,1, The first time I saw this game, I thought it would be bad.  Why did I buy it? It's on sale and there's a refund feature.  But hell, I was wrong, big time.  I didn't really know anything about this game nor Goichi Suda prior buying it. I was just interested in it because the style was odd for a visual novel.  The game is like most of the reviews mentioned: - an English remaster - weird vibes - story that is hard to understand - insanity  Most of the reviews even said &quot;the dialogues are kinda cheesy and lame.&quot;  From what I think; it's f*ckin 90's, most people talk like these back in 90's which they thought it was either cool or rude. It's just no one really talks like these anymore in the 2010's, people change.  The story is not really generic, it's pretty original in my opinion. A serial murderer so infamous that people got influenced to be a successor, plagiarism, because how they think the murderer is an inspiration the world should know. Later followed by a sick twist that'll leave you confused.  Music? It's not memorable, it's not bad. It just does what it was meant to be, filling the atmosphere of the game, either tensed or relaxed.  EDIT: Regarding music, some of Yamaoka's remaster are stuck in my head, e.g; Tokio Morishima, and the original OP music is probably my favorite whistling material.  Characters? Many of them are memorable. Weird traits and the common ones.  What I really like about this game is how they execute it. Its just unlike every other visual novels you've ever played before. Some left my jaw open.  It's a must-buy if you're into experimental games, because this one feels experimental for me.

The game looks so gorgous graphically, Very Addictive to play between time to time. yes its short but very inspiring.  Beware, you will not be held like a baby step by step to tell you what to do, instead the game uses your instincts to make you understand whats going on around you and what your supposed to do.  i am now on my NEWGAME + Using Steam controller on a 4K screen, very beuatiful. Trust me, its a little game youall should have. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/AKBAAR/recommended/671510,1, such calssic rouge like Dark souls like but with Minimilistic almost no huds , simple and cunnig game, better played with controller.  Dont Expect a game that will hold your hand and show you the way.. it does that by letting you yourself explore and understand whats going on by using pattern of behaviour that cause you to see whats going on and how to fight properly.  I am on My second run it has Newgame+ .  Amazing Graphics with so pretty Particle effects (Ultra = MAX+++). Playing as Female charcter with a hair that moves around satisfying.  it has this powerful plus satisfying sword fight and strong hits bloody and gory that make you feel your sword ... just so epic.  playing this game on 4K + steam Controller = Epicness .

https://steamcommunity.com/id/rezombie/recommended/554620,1, I was a bit skeptical about the prequel, but it delivered in every possible way. It's a bit sad when you already know Rachel's fate, but it also puts things in perspective and makes the story even more emotional. Life is Strange: Before the Storm is not just some bone thrown at us to play with while waiting for Life is Strange 2, it's a great game on its own, and kudos to Deck Nine for keeping up with the original developers. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/AKBAAR/recommended/633950,1, very intuetive game. clever little game very modern looking.. cute way hloding the girls hand around and take care of her. makes the game more diverse!

Totally recommend!!!  one con though not sure about it... --- max health reached??? i dont know if i reached max health (bug) or not but it wont let me upgrade my health. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/insanitysmuse/recommended/220780,1, I really enjoyed this game. I feel like many other shortish, smallish indie games, it really demonstrates the difference between storytelling in a game vs. other potential mediums like movies or books. The narration helps sell this experience quite a bit, and the intuitive progression and level design help as well. There's a few harder parts but overall nothing too frustrating and the writing is quite excellent.  It might be a little short for the full $10 but I'm not sure I would have been mad to pay that, but as I got it for more like $2, I'm quite happy indeed.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/insanitysmuse/recommended/558110,-1, I feel like this game kind of misses the mark for what it was going for, or at least claiming to be. It is largely just reading, with a pretty limited interactive puzzle based on what you read. I think this is not really taking advantage of the medium at all, an education game should FOCUS on the interactive experience allowed by the fact of being a game. As it was presented here, it just felt like I was reading an &quot;Astronomy for Dummies&quot; book, like chapter 1 or 2, with some clicking periodically and extra story thrown in to give some kind of excuse.   The puzzles themselves are pretty simple because they rely so heavily on one or two sentences of what you read, a couple basic principles each. While that's not particularly bad, the fact you have to read so much for such short simple puzzles which boil down to simple concepts is definitely off putting and never really gives a feeling of accomplishment, or learning, really.   It really reminds me of being in the astronomy section of a science museum but with more reading and fewer interactive exhibits, actually. It might be worth picking up on sale for some specific purpose, but even then, I might wait until something better comes along. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/lordkosc/recommended/503940,1, Giving this a thumbs up. Feel it is a solid game that is feature complete, and fun to play. Very few bugs.  It could use more documentation, especially regarding the warehouse and how it works. I'll be damned if I can get it to accept my cotton transports. Also learning to use the signals took an hour or so of messing around in free mode with them. Check out videos on youtube if you are on the fence deciding if you want to get this game or not. They will show you how it plays, far better than I can explain. Dev's did a good job!

Yes, it's that short. I recommend this game only if you're interested in a quick perfect game for your stats. Other than that, this walking simulator has very little to offer you. Beautiful scenery, a couple of simplistic mini-games, and that's it, you're done here. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/lordkosc/recommended/368390,1, Fanastic art, great cases, top tier music, a good buddy cop friendship between McQueen and Dooley, I highly reccomend this. It has just the right ammount of humor and pixels. So glad that a 2nd season is in the works.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/spektrumgame/recommended/319630,1, Episode 1 itself was amazing. Honestly the cinematic  and the coloring in this game is absolutely gorgeous. Also the story itself is very compelling and ties the players in. While playing it, yo could honestly feel for Max, it's almost like you know her in a personal level. Amazing game, honestly I recommend it to everyone. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/insanitysmuse/recommended/264710,1, I originally saw Subnautica going through one of my queues for a holiday sale, and ended up flagging as &quot;not interested&quot; - at the time it was early access, tagged as horror / survival / underwater / aliens, normally all stuff I don't care for significantly much. But after hearing it talked about so much, especially on Crate &amp; Crowbar, decided to give the full release a shot, and I'm glad I did.  It's an absolutely fantastic single player survival experience. It's probably the best survival game I have tried and it really puts into perspective what some love and effort put into the genre can produce. It has a campaign, and goals, but is relatively free form and most people will have their own experiences and paths towards the end, and it's nice they give the option of having a lighter mode if desired.   I will say though, I don't know how much I would have stuck with it if I hadn't installed the expanded inventory mod from Nexus. The inventories are absurdly small and moving things around storage and inventory is never interesting in any game. I maxed out the modded size of everything and STILL had to make decisions about what to take and what to leave behind. It changed the game from interesting but tedious to interesting and not tedious. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/lordkosc/recommended/362890,1, A fantastic revisit to one of the best FPS games ever made.   I almost wish these developers could make HL3. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/spektrumgame/recommended/554620,1, Great game, but very short. Pretty atmospheric which is awesome. Also an amazing soundtrack.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/insanitysmuse/recommended/396750,1, It's pretty great to see a game where the beautiful screenshots are actually what you get in the game. That is, of course, assuming you aren't dead before you push that screenshot button. The game feels pretty brutally hard at first and I can tell I have a lot of hours to go, but it controls well, looks fantastic, and is one of the few modern 3D arcade space shooters out there. The roguelike might turn some people off, and I think a linear version of the game could have been great, but it is what it is and persistant upgrades can help ease the pain of dying all the time to everything that isn't a bandit drone. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198164254391/recommended/264710,1, I want to live this game over and over again! I wish I could forget this game and replay it again and again! I want more!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnWade/recommended/439190,1, Awesome game, they tell me, and soon ill play it! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/insanitysmuse/recommended/432370,1, This is another great example of an experience that's really only possible through a game. It is rough around the edges but I loved it early on, I did have to look up something near the end because I thought I was giving the right answer but was off slightly. The biggest flaw it has is looking at the notebook takes you away from the terminal and vice versa, it seems like it wouldn't have been that difficult to implement having both on screen and make the overall experience a lot smoother.  If you have a passing interest in languages or linguistics, it's an interesting experience though for sure. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ObscureRadioNetwork/recommended/264710,1, Subnautica the most terrifying underwater experience its all so very deadly but all so amazingly beautiful. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/insanitysmuse/recommended/415920,1, It's hard to find a game that scratches the same itch that Final Fantasy Tactics gave me so long ago, but this comes pretty close. The game is definitely remiscent of it, with spending skill points to learn active and passive skills, having a primary &amp; secondary class to mix and match your skills, desperately trying to manuever just right so your healer doesn't get mauled down by that jerk void-monster-thing over there and the boss fights are all pretty fun. The music is surprisingly solid throughout and few tunes even stick in your head afterwards.  The only real bug I encountered I made a post about and had a response within a day or two from the dev (even though it was a pretty minor bug in the sceme of things). The game has an interesting inclusion of using shovels, picks, and other tools to interact with things on the map, sometimes obviously and sometimes secretly. The only real negative I have is that inventory management is kind of annoying, but I say that as someone who hates inventory management in literally every game that has it (Diablo, Fallout, etc.) so grain of salt there.  If you are out for a tactical RPG, this is a great one to give a shot. It might not look flashy but there's a lot of depth to uncover here. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/lordkosc/recommended/675010,1, Huge thumbs up, it is just a really fun game. And trying to figure out how to safely deliver logs and discover all the points and truck locations on the map causes me to get into that &quot;one more turn&quot;... I mean &quot;one more load to deliver&quot;, mindset.   
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198121207860/recommended/495890,1,  CALL OF DOGE - many spin, such no scope, WOW  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/insanitysmuse/recommended/282530,-1, I try to give games an honest chance, but after giving this one 3-4 extra chances, I'm just giving up on it. It is thoroughly mediocre, if it didn't have the Castlevania name I doubt it would have gained much traction at all. The &quot;combat&quot; is simple enough and clunky enough to feel like it was a phone or tablet game, not even a handheld. The story is passable for Castlevania, that was rarely the draw of the games, but it seemed a little weak even for them.   The graphics are fine. The checkpoint system is fairly forgiving. Which is good, because most of your deaths will be to dumb falls you couldn't tell was deadly, or from a new enemy that you don't know what kind of dodge to do to avoid until trial and error happens.   If you REALLY love all things new Castlevania, and even the most menial of 2D clunky platformers, it's probably worth it on deep sale, but I don't feel like it's worth any more of my hours than it already got. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/lordkosc/recommended/673880,1, Fantastic atmosphere, story so far has me engaged, controls makes sense and the tutorial gets across the basics. Game feels like it is hitting way above its budget price, very pleased so far. The game seemed to have very little pre-release / release publicity so I figured I'd get a positive impressions review up, to help spread the good word. If you like 40k lore and XCOM like gameplay this is the mash-up for you.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/lordkosc/recommended/484900,1, Giving this a thumbs up, I have enjoyed my time with the game and the developers continue to support it with free content drops. It has a very puzzle like aspect to it, when building your cities placement of structures and not over expanding are very important. I am a big fan of Anno and Settlers games, and this game is a welcome addition to the genre. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/insanitysmuse/recommended/588650,1, I'm sort of late to the party, maybe, by the standards of Early Access and what looks like several large patches between EA and now. But I bought the game and am having difficulty not playing it, so I feel like they're doing something right. It takes some of the &quot;progression&quot; ideas of other roguelikes (mostly just unlocking items) and puts them in a fantastic shell, with fast and fluid combat, occasional platforming, great tone and atmosphere, and so far minimal BS deaths.   It's EA and they already have done what looks like a major overhaul, so it could always get worse, but the fundamentals seem very very solid and I think I will enjoy it enough even if I just play to 100% now over the next week or two.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/SynysterDragon/recommended/335300,1, This when compared to the first seems worst when you start playing it. However the more you play it the more you will realise that although it doesn't have as good of a story, and the bosses are not as memorable, the customisation and the content far surpass the first game. And for some reason it seems that Dark souls 3 removed everything that was good with Dark souls 2 (hollowing, power stancing, non-humanoid bosses etc.) 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/insanitysmuse/recommended/612880,1, Not going to be one of my longest reviews, but here it is. It's basically TNO, but more of it. There music, voice acting, and sound in general is damn near perfect. The action and violence abounds, although it's bordering on the edge of a cover shooter more than an action shooter, until you get thoroughly upgraded. The story is as solid as TNO and some set pieces clearly pay homage to (and make you feel like you are in another version of) other FPS like Fallout, DOOM, and even The Old Blood, weirdly.   I haven't upgraded my hardware since before TNO came out, and I was able to run this on Ultra with only one or two frame drops the whole way through. That being said, it seems like a lot of people have issues, so I guess if it runs for you it runs well at least.  I do have some complaints but they aren't enough to push it negative:  Collectibles are way more annoying in this than in TNO. There's more of them and they require a lot more hunting and backtracking to get. It would have helped a lot if Star Cards dropped off enemies until you collected them all instead of just being more clutter hidden away. Also the other collectibles seem less outlined than loot laying around, even when you're looking right at one it can be hard to see. It detracted from the game for me because the collectibles in TNO were part of the flavor and world building, and rarely had to break the flow of the game much to get them, whereas here you can spend a good chunk of your time just trying to find the letters and whatnot. It's a shame to see one of my favorite parts of TNO take a solid step backwards.  Second would be the underuse of the bigger cast of characters, while relying on just a handful of the honestly not that interesting ones. It would have been great to see the other characters used outside of the free roaming hub section.  Third would be the auto-pickup radius is too small. If it was doubled it would probably feel about right. As it was, I found myself constantly passing back and forth over piles of bodies mashing the E button trying to pick up the supplies I needed.  If any of those 3 things sound like dealbreakers to you, then consider yourself warned, but the game overall is still a solid A from me. With a few improvements it could have been GOTY contender again but sadly, it falls short of that in the end. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/insanitysmuse/recommended/296550,1, I would say, on sale, it's worth it if you like the art style and puzzle / platformers, although honestly every instance of &quot;platforming&quot; was a negative experience.  The art and sound design of the game is fantastic, and I think it's worth suffering through the poor game design for. Platforming is required but adds nothing except frustration and time, many of the &quot;goals&quot; for a given task are completely obtuse and require just trying to push buttons you've never pushed or doing other things you've never done, with no suggestion that it's suddenly possible. For the most part, checkpoints (which are only needed because of the terrible platforming) are frequent, at least, aside from one on the last level. It's also terrible if you're an achievement completionist because there is no ability to select levels that I saw.  While that is a lot of negativity, a lot of the puzzles are actually quite interesting and well done, when not bogged down by platforming or needing to randomly click and walk around in circles trying to figure out what / where you can interact with something. And again, the sound and art design are fantastic. Thus, sticking with the &quot;worth it on the cheap&quot; suggestion.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198304646971/recommended/305620,1, Can I just start by saying that the sale price is an absolute steal? You get a great game that the devs are constantly improving. I have mostly played the sandbox mode, but also enjoyed the Halloween event 2018 (it was nice to get back into the game after a break). The story mode isn't that interesting, but would give it another try once it gets updated.  As someone not familiar with the survival genre, I learned to love The Long Dark quickly. After two years of playing, the best part is still the feeling of being lost. Starting in an unknown area with not much equipment and struggling to survive. Thanks to the new maps added, I still have unexplored areas left.  I entertain myself writing journal entries for characters that survive past the first couple of days. None of mine have made it to 50 days, partly because I lost some saves when the game was still in early access. I admit it made me want to play less, but nevertheless TLD has remained my favourite game on Steam and I give it a strong recommendation.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198304646971/recommended/554620,1, I have only played the first chapter, but enjoyed it more than I could imagine. The first chapters from original LiS felt a little bit dull to me, but then the rest of it was intense (that's an understatement really). With Before the Storm I was able to get into the story right away. I like that there are no super powers this time. It makes it easier to relate to the characters. To my surprise I'm truly enjoying playing Chloe, guess it's just fun being a rebel teenager? Going back to Chloe's house felt like visiting an old friend. My feelings for Rachel Amber changed many times during the first chapter and I loved how the story gave me these emotional nudges. I'm in no hurry to play the final chapters, because I want to be in the right mood when I do. My review of this game is obviously affected by my feelings about Life is Strange, but I would recommend it for all wannabe rebels out there.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198304646971/recommended/281990,1, I have not played games like Stellaris before, so this review is mostly for people like me who might be pondering whether it's worth getting. I bought Stellaris over a year ago, launched it a couple of times, but the controls didn't seem very intuitive and the game felt quite overwhelming. I decided I would play it later and this week I finally did.  I chose an avian species, Yondar, that looked kind and majestetic. I imagined they thought themselves a little bit better than others and probably dreamt of enslaving another species. With that in mind they started exploring space. Unfortunately, this far they've only met species with more advanced systems than theirs. They managed to build an alien zoo, but it -and the whole planet- was lost when some mutated creatures killed off the colony. Now Yondars are on a quest for Alien Specimen Procurement, which I think is the perfect thing to highlight their superiority.  At the moment I'm having problems with pirates raiding them, because I have neglected building their fleet and used resources wastefully. There's no doubt I have made a ton of strategic mistakes and because of that I don't except Yondars to thrive very long. I plan to check some game guides before starting over with another species. Overall, it's been a fun journey this far (I confess, I'm hooked) and that's why I would recommend Stellaris, especially when on sale. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/lordkosc/recommended/692840,-1, Movement doesn't feel right. One of the core basics of a functional game, and it doesn't feel right.    For lulz try jumping sideways or walking in water.  I mean it looks great and all, but it feels like it needs at least 6+ more months of tweaking.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/288060,1, Games like this are hard to judge on face value alone. When you take more common, action oriented titles, it can be easier to tell from just a minute or two of uninterrupted gameplay footage if a game is going to be worth your time or not. But slower paced, narrative focused titles, like Whispering Willows, are considerably harder to figure out from just viewing a short trailer. Games like this are driven by their quality of narrative and puzzle design. Does the crisp and whimsical imagery evident in WW¡¯s screenshots affirm a similarly elegant literary and brain teasing experience? Unfortunately, no, not even close. But Whispering Willows is still an endearing first effort by fledgling studio Night Light Interactive, even with the game¡¯s numerous flaws. In fact, it¡¯s more what the game  doesn¡¯t  try to do that is most disheartening.  I¡¯ll begin with the most egregious error this game makes: the quality of narrative. The story is thus: young Elena¡¯s father has gone missing, and has been for some time. After waking from a particularly vivid nightmare of her father being held captive by  something , she races to an old, decrepit mansion, of which her father is the groundskeeper. She soon meets the ghost of her ancestor, who teaches her of her heritage, and of her innate ability to leave her body and walk the earth as a spirit, allowing her to commune with the ghosts of those who have yet to pass. What follows is a supernatural tale of loss, deceit and the darkness that festers within.   In truth, the narrative plays out like cross between a darker Goosebumps tale with bits of Clive Barker¡¯s grotesque imagery. This is partly due to the art style; it just doesn¡¯t convey feelings of foreboding and fearfulness that I believe the narrative wants to. Worse, the story takes virtually no risks. But what really hurts the experience is the quality of the dialogue. Throughout the adventure, you will speak with the deceased, and often be asked to find items of importance to them to progress through the story. The dialogue that occurs here is just, well¡­ the best thing I can call it would be, ¡°serviceable¡±. The dialogue is so often uninspired and plain that it would keep me from really caring for any of the characters¡¯ plights.   I feel I¡¯ve spoken enough on the negatives of the narrative, so let¡¯s move on to the disappointment of the game¡¯s main mechanic, your spirit form, and the weak puzzle design dependent on it. The lack of pluralization is not a mistake, Whispering Willows¡¯ mechanic of Elena¡¯s spirit form most often offers only a single type of puzzle throughout the game. You will come across locked doors, and you will either need to pick up a poorly hidden key or flip a switch. Usually, this means that there is a finely carved, perfectly square hole in the wall or ceiling near to you for your spirit form to slink through. Do so, and there will be a bright blue glowing  thing  for you to interact with. This interaction opens the door. This is how nearly every ¡°puzzle¡± in WW plays out. I can only think of a handful of individual puzzles that do not play out in the same way, though they themselves were no more complex than filling a hole or playing Simon Says with a moveable object. The simple puzzle design falls in line with the game¡¯s progression; it¡¯s largely linear, with nary a handful of instances where you will have to seek out an item outside of the area you¡¯re already in. Even then, though, the item¡¯s location is always spelled out for you, so this is really no more than a mode of adding longevity to this short adventure. And it  is  short. In total, I completed the game in under three hours.  Whew, that was a lot of negativity. How about we move on to the more positive aspects of Willows? Speaking purely of the in-game graphics and art style, my opinion is decidedly varied. On one hand, the environments that you explore never amount to anything special, and much like the dialogue, they are content with remaining largely serviceable. The same can be said for the few human characters in-game, who, along with some stilted animations, look oddly plain. This is in stark contrast to my favorite portion of the game, the ghost designs. Their visages reflect how they died, and their appearances range from the grotesque to cringe inducing. Their designs are absolutely phenomenal, and it¡¯s evident where the best of the artistic talent went in the creation of this game. The same can be said for Elena¡¯s own spirit form, whose flowing hair and glowing visage look fantastic, especially in the light of the full moon in outdoor areas.   While the dialogue between yourself and haunting spirits itself does the overall narrative little favor, your interactions with the ghosts of the mansion¡¯s grounds are enriched by the previously mentioned collectible notes scattered along your path throughout the game. Each is one of several diary entries left by the formerly living, and each tells a tale of their final days. While few of them are terribly unique in their subject matter, finding that final piece of each story provided me a greater driving force for playing than the main narrative itself.   As negative as this review has been, the greatest fault I can levy against this game is not what it does poorly, but rather in what it does not even attempt to do. Given all that has already been done with a similar ability in other games, why is Elena¡¯s spirit walking ability as limited as it is? The game is content with delivering only the most lackluster and plain variation possible. And the dialogue... in an adventure title such as this, gameplay often takes a backseat to the narrative. Only, in this case, both aspects are severely limited in their designs. If the sole gameplay mechanic is to be as limited as it is, why was the dialogue not given greater love, to compensate? The game is so filled with potential, and occasionally, this potential appears as though it¡¯s so near to bubbling to the surface, only to be pushed back down below by weak interactions and the umpteenth recycled door ¡°puzzle¡±.  I did not hate my time with Whispering Willows. Though admittedly, my want to love it so completely has perhaps made me more critical of its faults. I¡¯ll leave it at this: Whispering Willows, for all of its promise, is content with providing only an unenthusiastic effort on its part. For every glimmer of something fresh and unique, of which there are a few, Willows buries it under less-than-uninspired dialogue and consistently recycled puzzle design. I beat the game, with all of my fumbling, in under three hours. By the end, my only thoughts were on what  could have been , had this game taken just a little more risk, rather than on my final moments with Elena. There just isn¡¯t enough content or thought put into Whispering Willows to make it  fully  recommendable.   6.5/10  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/HatMatters/recommended/253230,1, Probably the best platformer game ever.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/295850,-1, Vlad is an interesting beast, though not nearly for the best reasons. Having the benefit of knowing exactly what this game was, prior to the eventual retooling of its originally  more  misleading store page description, I was not taken aback by what it proved to be: a choose-your-own-adventure literary experience, and little else. But oddly enough, despite some decently written miniature tales and absolutely superb artistic direction, it¡¯s soon evident that the writers behind Vlad had absolutely no idea how to connect the individual pieces into a single, coherent storyline, and it leads to an utter mess of a tale.  Despite previously calling it so, Vlad should barely even be considered a CYOA. Calling it as such would imply that that there is some reasoning behind your decisions and actions, and that the overall narrative follows a distinct path of your choosing. Rather, you¡¯re given a series of locations in which you can randomly choose to visit. Choose, and you¡¯re given a several paragraph snippet of some unique occurrence, where you¡¯ll be given a single option that will usually reward or detract skill points from any number of your available stats. These events have no relevance to overall narrative, and serve only to manipulate your stats, which themselves are completely  ir relevant until the very end. The  actual  narrative is only touched on at specific points after a certain number of ¡°turns¡± have passed. Only, these points, while not necessarily ¡°jumping around¡±, speak of events that never happened, of people and groups that you, the player, likely never have heard of prior, and attempts to piece together a story using only the beginning, several middle points, and end, without ever offering what happens in between.   It¡¯s evident from the store page and individual stories present in the game that there are some very talented writers behind Vlad, the problem is that there¡¯s never any attempt to combine the different pieces into a single, or several, branching narratives, like a  real  CYOA. In retrospect, it¡¯s really no different than Telltale¡¯s more popular efforts, like Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us, but unlike in those, Vlad¡¯s narrative never truly becomes coherent, nor even attempts to hide the fact that your ¡°choices¡± amount to nothing more than a statistic. More so, the ¡°game¡± lasts no more than a half hour, provided you calmly read through each piece. The gall of such developers to try and charge $10 for this is laughable and na?ve on their part, assuming they believed that word wouldn¡¯t quickly get around to avoid like the plague. But even so, while I would certainly call Vlad¡¯s narrative  broken , I wouldn¡¯t designate the entire experience as a wholly negative one. The art is absolutely fantastic, and is the highest contributor to Vlad¡¯s quality, and the individual stories, short as they are, are a joy to read. While the overall narrative is poorly meshed together, the ¡°lite¡± RPG elements barely tacked on, and the asking price positively ridiculous, despite my negative grade, I would recommend that once this is bundled, to give it a run through, or even several. There are more unique events than you can visit in a single playthough, and they are fun, very short reads. As a CYOA, this ¡°game¡± is a veritable failure, but as a brief and unique diversion from the more common experiences on steam, Vlad  can  entertain for the very short while it lasts.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/260530,1, Given the charming, cutesy art and some emphasis on riding creatures, my initial thoughts were that  So Many Me  would be akin to Nintendo¡¯s favorite kid-friendly pink puffball, Kirby, with some added puzzle elements to round out the package. And in some ways, I was right. The aforementioned art design is adorable and inviting, and riding the animals, (especially the dino), brought back fond memories of riding Rick the Hamster or Coo the Owl from Kirby¡¯s Dreamland. But this is where the similarities to Nintendo¡¯s friendliest series end, and for the better, in many respects.  So Many Me ¡¯s emphasis on expansive, challenging puzzles and platforming prowess provides an exceptionally demanding cerebral and dexterous experience that I never expected. And I absolutely adored every moment of it.  From the moment you boot up the game, you¡¯re assaulted by one of the cutest and charming art styles this side of  Kirby¡¯s Epic Yarn , and from the get-go, the bubbly movement of the characters and the world they inhabit put a big smile on my face. But as adorable as they are, the graphics disguise the true nature of  So Many Me . It¡¯s  extremely  challenging. It¡¯s easy to reach the end of each level, sure, but by  only  doing so, you¡¯re missing out on more than half of what the game has to offer. Of the main worlds, (of which there are four, each with their own specific gimmicks) reaching the end, as I said, is easy to do. Rather than simple exercises in moving rightwards whilst jumping over small pits, levels range from small to expansive networks filled with traps and tricks for you decipher your way around. Most are avoidable, unless you aim to collect the three collectibles in each stage. Each level hides a costume, an extra Me, and an artifact. And these aren¡¯t hidden in the traditional sense; you¡¯ll be able to see them, plain as day, as well as the seemingly impossible-to-bypass trickery blocking your path to each. This is where the  true  game lies. The puzzles between you and those delectable collectibles range from the small and simple to the overly complex and level-wide. Even once you¡¯ve figured out  what  you¡¯re supposed to do, it¡¯s an entirely different matter pulling it all off without screwing up.   And you will mess up. A big part of what makes these often complex puzzle layouts complex , is that in congruence with an often demanding level of dexterity on your part, you will have to carefully manage the use of your me¡¯s which provide you with stepping stones, switch presses, bounce pads and other varying abilities dependent on world. Mess up the proper order of tasks even once, and it¡¯s back to step one. It¡¯s as much about strategy as it is making each clean jump. I often found myself stuck on figuring out several of the more complex puzzles in the game for nearly a half hour or more, since there are often so many pieces you can experiment with, but it made the satisfaction of  finally  getting that artifact or costume so much sweeter. But most importantly, the collectibles  matter . Besides the obvious use of having extra mes or new costumes (which you can use to uniquely dress up each and every me), artifacts are used to purchase perks, which range from the purely aesthetic to the all-but-necessary in reaching certain collectibles. There are no superfluous ¡°good job!¡± collectibles here, and when the game  really  makes you earn each and every one, it truly feels like an achievement.  Luckily, checkpoints are forgiving, and so long as you remain in the level, enemies do not respawn outside of specific instances, even after you fall into a spike pit a half dozen times. And thankfully, you¡¯re never asked to find every collectible in a single go; you¡¯re free to try again at any time, as each level is easily selected from the game¡¯s pause menu. Allow me to iterate: Once you find a me in a given level, or a costume, or an artifact, it¡¯s yours. Once you kill an enemy, outside of specific instances, that enemy remains gone, as long as you remain in the level. This all leads to levels feeling more like contained little worlds, rather than  just  levels, each with their own sense of progression, especially in some specific instances, where smaller puzzles act as cogs leading into a whole. Further variation in mechanics come in the form of your creatures, which you¡¯ll utilize plenty, and the boss battles ending each world. These are generally of no real concern once you have their given patterns down, and it¡¯s only until the final boss that you might have any real trouble, as the difficulty is dramatically increased here from what you¡¯ve faced previously. But again, it¡¯s all a matter of pattern memorization and careful movement.  For anyone more inclined toward the purely platformer aspect of  So Many Me , in addition to the four main worlds and end boss levels, the developers have kindly opted to include a fifth bonus world, filled almost entirely with exceptionally challenging platformance gauntlets. Many of these courses demand perfection on the part of the player to succeed, even more so than some of the later levels in the standard worlds, and each offers two elusive artifacts just out of reach for all but the most skilled platformer aficionados. With no checkpoints to speak of, a few skirt the line of frustration that lies between the game¡¯s mechanics and your own inability to succeed, though it typically lies closer to the latter. I cannot stress how challenging some these completely optional segments are, and along with the larger puzzles provide some of the most satisfying moments in the game to best, especially with both artifact pieces in tow.   So Many Me  is brilliant. If it wasn¡¯t clear in the preceding paragraphs, know now that I adored the entire experience. Despite looking more kid friendly in nature,  So Many Me  offers a fantastic challenge for puzzle and platformer fanatics alike, with some extremely intricate puzzles requiring serious forethought as well as dexterity and finesse. And to that end, allow me to make clear one final time: more than half the game lies in collecting the various trinkets. Failure to even attempt would be denying yourself the immense joy in besting the devious designs keeping them from you, and would keep you from experiencing the best of what this game has to offer, since reaching the end itself contains comparably little challenge on its own. Try and best each level, trinkets and all, and I guarantee that you will love the adventure as much as I. It took me 10 hours to complete everything, and that included plenty of screen-staring just trying to figure out many of the given puzzles. A keener mind than mine will finish it much more quickly.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/281840,-1, I will give the developer credit where it is due; 4PM¡¯s store page bills itself as a mature and unique, albeit short narrative promising an emotional ride on the subjects of alcoholism and suicide. Along with the trailer and screenshots, (that admittedly look pretty good), and a low, low price point, it seems a promising option among the rest of the junk that regularly pops up on steam. And that is where I must give the developer his due; he¡¯s made a really good sell. And that¡¯s the best I can say, because the game itself is a laughable experience, and for literally every wrong reason there could be.  First, the entire game is put through a ridiculously prominent fuzz filter, one that is evidently absent from the store¡¯s trailer and screenshots, likely to better entice you into wasting your money. The filter itself is used to try and mask the horrid graphics underneath, but it doesn¡¯t succeed. It loads slowly for no apparent reason, breaking up the many short mid-scene jumps with even longer loading freezes. Worse, the actual animations of the cast, particularly their faces, makes any attempt at creating an emotional resonance with the player fail miserably. Instead, the poor acting and bug eyed reactions will likely give  you  the same reaction as I had: loudly laughing your head off at the sheer stupidity at every attempt at ¡°drama¡±.   And what little attempt at a story there is, happens almost entirely at the end. ¡°The big reveal¡± that occurs near the end of every good drama is shoehorned in with only a couple minutes of??????poor dialogue, with virtually no real exposition or story prior. The absolute pretentiousness of it all is positively palpable throughout.  Despite how utterly trash this game is, I recommend it to a specific brand of person. Anyone who enjoyed the previous King to the Pretentious Kingdom,  Dinner Date , is in for a real treat. Where I found DD to be comparably boring, 4PM offers several moments of gut wrenching hilarity, particularly during mid-game, where gears shift from pretentious slop to  White Girl Simulator 2014 . The entire thing lasts little more than around 25 minutes, and most of that time will be occupied wondering if something is ever going to happen. When something finally does, the credits come not 2 minutes later, and you¡¯ll be left wondering how a single developer could create such an experience, let alone reach his keyboard, with his head so far up his own log cutter.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/13500,1, Of the Sands of Time trilogy, Warrior Within is easily the most controversial of the bunch. Forgoing the whimsical  Nights of Arabia  theme of the much beloved Sands of Time, Warrior Within employs a much darker tone, replacing melodic instrumentals with blood pumping metal music, and an emperor¡¯s majestic castle with that of some dreadful thing from a metal album cover. Gone, too, is the storybook hero known only as the Prince, who is now a curse spewing, murder loving psychopath, easy to anger and eager to slice open stomachs. Understandably, not all took a liking to the new Prince of Persia, and many either wrote it off or gave up after dying in the first 10 minutes, all while cursing the monsters at Ubisoft who would dare slight their beloved franchise so vehemently. I am ashamed to admit that while I did not join in the publisher bashing those many years prior, I  did  assume the many fans¡¯ angers as legitimate. After having neglected the franchise for many years since the original, I have finally played through the trilogy¡¯s entirety. Lo and behold, my judgment is thus: Warrior Within is the best of the Prince of Persia trilogy, and one of the most challenging and equally frustrating and rewarding titles I have ever had the pleasure of besting.  Where its predecessor, The Sands of Time, relied on linear level progression, a typically gradually increasing difficulty, and relatively basic (and easy) combat, Warrior Within features a (sort of) open world, varied weapons of combat, and enemies that will break your face if you¡¯re not perfect. It also features a higher emphasis on combat than its predecessor,  and  some of the most frustrating puzzle and enemy design than any other game I¡¯ve played in years. But understand what I mean by that. Warrior Within, for the entire duration, never held my hand. The moment I felt I had a handle on how to deal with an enemy type, a brand new exploding, near unavoidable dog animal thing would be introduced. Obviously, it wasn¡¯t always an exploding dog thing, but you get the point. WW is never easy or gradual in its difficulty. It¡¯s not typically fair, either, but it also never felt impossible, and that¡¯s what made it fantastic. For comparison, while playing Demon¡¯s Souls, I always felt in control of what I was doing, and typically only died if I was quick to run into a room before checking for barriers to hide behind, traps or tricky enemies in the shadows. WW will put you in a room and deal death unto you until you learn to deal with it, and the experience became infinitely rewarding upon besting said situations.   Puzzles don¡¯t quite follow the same degree of difficulty that the combat does, but the challenge comes in unintended traversal. By puzzles, I refer to the Prince of Persia¡¯s method of travel; running along walls, sliding down ropes and hanging banners, and avoiding the many, many spikes and saw blades inexplicably sticking out of walls. The open world aspect of Warrior Within allows you to re-visit any portion of the island that you¡¯ve previously visited, and you don¡¯t necessarily have to follow the same paths. However, the design of these pathways are sometimes altered by the game¡¯s events, and even when they aren¡¯t, traversal in any way different from the standard is a challenge in and of itself, as the developers clearly did not design these paths to be easily followed backwards (or forwards, for that matter), as you will have to do. Worse yet, enemy spawns remain, especially those bastard dogs I mentioned previously, the ones that can take half of your health. If this sounds frustrating to you, it should. But by the point you should even be considering doing anything like this, you will have already become invested in beating down this seemingly personal hell that the developers have created just for you.  I won¡¯t divulge any of my secrets for passing through Warrior Within, and quite frankly, I would recommend any and all to refrain from guides as much as possible throughout (except for the collectibles, you¡¯ll need a guide for those). Warrior Within is a truly brutal and often unfair achievement in sadistic game design. It¡¯s also one of my most satisfying completions in the entirety of my gaming career. Nearly every instance of combat in this title will chew on your face and kick you in your?????until you  really  learn to play it. The learning curve can be steep and unfair, and you will want to quit. Don¡¯t. There are no tricks to Warrior Within, and only your skill, and hopefully a share of dumb luck, will see you succeed. What faults it has, of which there are plenty, only add to the experience.. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/306040,-1, I will admit, I only bothered to look at this game due to its very cool graphical style. Though, on watching the gameplay video and reading the main synopsis present on the store page, I became fearful of a very real possibility. Namely, that hiding behind an excellent artistic direction is a shallow, and probably irritating, gimmick driven ¡°game¡±. Not unexpectedly, I¡¯m obliged to report that my suspicions proved accurate, but also that my discoveries come with several reservations.  First, the gameplay itself (and this should be obvious from the accompanying trailers), is minimal. The goal is to slowly raise and lower your balloon in tune with the weather patterns, which push you left and right, to varying degrees, and land at some designated point. As the game goes on, you¡¯ll have to contend with the added complexity of doing this several times per level, and occasionally even drop things down holes or bombs on unsuspecting flying spiky balls. Playing with a standard mouse, this gets boring, and at times irritating, though mostly due to the slow nature of your balloon and having to  wait  for your chance to fail again. Chances are, you will have to reset levels several times due to popping or floating too far off-screen. This is where the gimmick comes in, and the developers clearly hope that people haven¡¯t learned from every other throwaway peripheral and gimmick that console makers try to push down our throats. By using your mic, you can control the balloon with your voice. Or any manner of sound, I suppose, so long as you can easily fluctuate it. This is also where my first aforementioned reservation comes in. If you can entertain yourself for hours on end by making stupid noises in the dark, than by all means, play and thoroughly enjoy The Howler. If you¡¯re considering this as a fun diversion for you and your drunk friends, ask yourself this ¨C when was the last time you were able to keep a group of drunks quiet for more than 5 seconds? If you can¡¯t answer that question, than you¡¯re better dusting off the ol¡¯ Kinect for another go around of drunk digital soccer.  Now here¡¯s my second reservation: the art design. It is superb, often ranging from the melancholy to the downright foreboding. And of course, the Wolf. It really bothers me that such a fantastic art style is wasted on a game like this. Given that this mediocre excursion could be beaten in little more than hour (provided you¡¯re forced to reset as often as I had to), than I would seriously consider recommending this title given you have a fondness for such things. If you can forgive, or at the very least tolerate the gameplay, than you may have a better time than I did, if only for the joy of viewing the set pieces. Know, though, that for some reason the game is limited to a small window (surrounded by a large black border in fullscreen), and cannot appear to be changed. While this keeps the art crisp and clean, I am disappointed that I couldn¡¯t have a closer look at some of the better murals.  The Howler is based off of a book, and you¡¯ll see a direct link to it on  Amazon.com  in the game¡¯s menu. It¡¯s a shame that there is absolutely no exposition or plot to the game¡¯s events, offering only a quick phrase explaining your mission for whatever group and  off you go! . Perhaps it might have alleviated the boredom of the actual gameplay mechanic to have given it all a more defined purpose. In any case, The Howler is something you probably shouldn¡¯t even bother playing in the first place. Unless you really think you¡¯re going to enjoy making stupid noises into your mic for an hour, or absolutely refuse to use google to find the game¡¯s sublime artwork, I¡¯d recommend you at least find a better mobile port to spend your time on.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/293740,1,  Road Not Taken is a roguelike puzzle game about surviving life¡¯s surprises . But life is so often content with stagnation and repetition, offering what seems the same grind over and over and over, soon only occasionally taunting with the glimmer of something new. But that¡¯s just the way of things; everything new becomes old, in time. Eventually,  new  just begins to run out. RNT follows a similar cycle; in the beginning, discovering all these new things and how you can change and adapt them to your uses is exciting and intoxicating. But soon enough, the  new  is exhausted , and with it, the allure of the prospect of new discoveries waiting just behind each locked gate. RTN is profusely entertaining up until you realize this point has come, but even after then, its unique and challenging formula saves it for a time, despite other issues, both glaring and minute.  RNT plays off its theme of ¡°life¡¯s little mysteries¡± remarkably well in its gameplay. As the town¡¯s new ranger, you¡¯re tasked in each of your years with rescuing the children lost to the woods during each winter¡¯s storm. To deliver them safely, you¡¯ll have to guide each to any of the waiting mothers, wherever they may be, using your limited amount of energy in carrying the odds and ends populating each level. The greatest joy had in this game also provides its greatest challenge; the discovering of new items and creatures that can both greatly hinder or assist you in your search. There¡¯s a surprising amount of variety in the number of ways things can interact, with many even able to change into new forms entirely, given the proper combination. You¡¯ll quickly begin filling your travel book with all manner of creatures and their respective ¡°recipes¡±. Eventually, puzzles that seemed impossible in the beginning are soon found to have only been so due to your own ignorance of some combination relevant to the situation.  But here¡¯s the rub, and it¡¯s one that eventually hinders all games of this sort. After a while, it¡¯s very noticeable which pieces the game favors, and which ones have yet to appear more than once, if even that. There¡¯s a handful of items and creatures that are exceptionally common, changing in relation to your years. In my playthroughs, those handfuls have been identical. The aforementioned variety in items and enemies becomes less so when the same few common assets are used ad nauseam, which is a shame, given the inventiveness of some of the lesser used pieces.  In between winters, your time is spent in the town you call home. Here, you can take your hard earned coins, rice, berries, etc, and trade them for townsfolk¡¯s friendship, a la the story of  Rainbow Fish . In return, you may receive helpful recipes for your book, or even better, equip-able trinkets. Early earned trinkets¡¯ perks are useful in smaller capacities, but the greater are earned through repeat visits. They, along with the tradeables found in the forest, make up the other half of the Roguelike formula, namely the part that you lose upon death. Make too many mistakes, resulting in zero energy or too few children saved, and all of these are lost. Given the time investment needed to get the better ones, I¡¯ll admit to believing this a bit harsh, especially since death can often be the result of truly unfair elements brought on by the roguelike system, like unavoidable loss of children to enemies or rare, impassible gates due to poor default placement of pieces.  A point of contention for me lies here as well, particularly in the store page¡¯s embellishment of a winding, twisting narrative, unique to each journey. The only narrative comes in the townsfolk, who remain constant, personalities and dialogue alike. Even their preferences in tradeables remains identical between playthoughs. The only change is that of color scheme, and which one is most willing to marry you, which becomes readily apparent early on. Despite store page promises of offering the opportunity to lead a unique life each playthrough, the character with obvious affection for you will always yield trinkets and info for fewer tradeables. There¡¯s no reason to invest in anyone else.   Regardless of my issues with it (mostly with the not-so-random level randomization), RNT is tremendous fun, and it¡¯s a unique challenge that I¡¯m going to continue playing, if only to try and earn the remaining pages to my travel book. In retrospect, my biggest issues could easily be rectified with a few randomization patches, or better yet, a future DLC expansion. As it is, the journey slowly loses its luster more than several hours in, but it never loses its shine altogether. The combination of some amusingly humorous travel book entries, a charming art design and some legitimately unsettling sound work help to mask the budding feeling of familiarity on repeat journeys. I think what¡¯s most disappointing is that despite the game¡¯s want to emulate the  unpredictability  of life, it has instead exemplified how easily it can fall into routine and predictability. While the initial few hours and playthrough are wholly the most entertaining, a lackluster attempt at differentiating narrative and the occasional sense of d¨¦j¨¤ vu on later playthroughs only slightly diminish an otherwise fantastic puzzle-rogue.

Subnautica is an outstandingly amazing open-world survival game compared to other similar games I have played, such as The Long Dark, No Man¡¯s Sky and the Forest.   Many years ago a game called Hydrophobia impressed me a lot with the theme and gameplay experience, but due to its limits that you cannot play freely as you want. So over the years I have been fascinated by any open-world adventure game that offers the most imagination and creativity for players. I guessed it would be No Man¡¯s Sky with the first sight because it totally meets my expectations for both open-world and outer space. Unfortunately, with bugs and unfinished contents it ended up in trash can.   Subnautica did that in a way that provides all I want for an ideal space based open-world survival game, and there will be more upcoming new contents to make this game more enjoyable. It¡¯s your turn to conquer the fear from the bottom of the deep blue.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/asturaro/recommended/863550,1, Hitman 2 is a 3rd person stealth puzzle game built around big open sandboxes that reward you for exploring, experimenting and thinking on your feet. But planning is still the best way to go, and for that you need to observe, study and memorize levels, characters and items. Pulling out a perfect assassination with no alerts after careful preparation provides great satisfaction.

It was terrifying, but so loveable at the same time and I really enjoyed the experience of it. I'm sad that in under 4 hours I was done with the game, but there are a few secrets worth looking for in this novel... Not game, but novel. I won't spoil anything about the game for those who have yet to play it, but this is something that should be experienced... As long as the subjects of abuse, depression, self harm, obsession and death isn't something that a problem for those experincing the story. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/311190,1, Despite originally brushing off  Super Panda Adventures  as just another throwaway (and ugly) platformer when I purchased it in a bundle many months ago, once coming to Steam, I opted to boot it up and actually experience the trainwreck first hand, if only for the card drops. If there was ever a grander example of the wisdom, ¡°never judge a book by its cover¡±, I¡¯ve not found it (at least on Steam). A word to all: Ignore the obvious warning signs of a budget price and lackluster art;  SPA  is a surprising amount of fun, and offers a stupendous metroidvania adventure, despite a few small flaws along the way.  What surprised me most about  SPA  wasn¡¯t the notably tight controls nor the exceptionally entertaining notion of controlling a panda with a katana. No, what surprised me was the sheer size of the level layouts, and the many paths therein. Levels are typically huge, and often reach deep into the ground and high into the clouds. While there are plenty of collectibles and upgrades waiting to be discovered, the emphasis on exploration and pathfinding is based more on your abilities and equipment as you find them, rather than on hidden paths or destructible walls. Meaning, the passage to a new upgrade is usually only blocked by a wall higher than your current jump, or a door requiring a key that you can¡¯t reach for a similar reason. Repeat exploration is encouraged, and most levels feature  something  new to do after each new ability is earned.   Combat is also surprisingly prevalent and entertaining, but then, the prospect of a sword wielding panda is an entertainment in its own right.  SPA  features a leveling system, powered by hidden caches of points and killing enemies alike. Typical upgrades are standard fare, but by finding special orbs in each level, your armor and weapons can be upgraded, and changed in appearance as a result. Although I never became bored with the combat, exploring and re-exploring the same levels over again  could  have felt more tedious without the consistent rewards of combat or in seeking out hidden caches.   Not all is well, however, and while minor, there are several notable flaws that hamper the experience. Boss encounters typically carry a massive disparity in difficulty from the rest of the adventuring, due to enormous health bars and attacks equally both powerful and annoyingly difficult to avoid. The large levels, while a joy to run around in and explore, have no map system to fall back on, and so path finding relies solely on memory. When looking for each and every collectible and upgrade, that fact becomes irritating quickly, especially on the more vertical levels. Worse, there is no ¡°percentage complete¡± function, and so those missing odds and ends could literally be hidden in any level, and there¡¯d be no solid clue as to which.   Regardless of listed faults,  SPA  is an absolute delight. While the unenthusiastic art design would normally all but promise a similar quality of gameplay,  SPA  provides a metroidvania styled adventure similar to what you would expect of a higher priced title. Given the quality, this game  could  have been sold at a standard $10 price point. For a standard asking rate of only $4, it¡¯s an absolute steal.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/raventheghost/recommended/531510,1, I cannot tell you how much I want to hug the developers. Firstly, I'm not all that big a fan of bullet-hell like games (Though I own a couple... Shush.) But this game, with the simple, yet lovable graphics and the AMAZING soundtrack (I have to find some of these songs just to add to my playlist now), was like a gem that spawned out of nowere for me. I kid not! I knew NOTHING about this game before playing. I never even heard of it before hand and my first hand experience with this game was so breath-taking... I was left speechless after the first song. Yeah. It's a good game. This is a must have for any who love bullet-hell games or electronic music... Or both even. (If you like both, then why aren't you buying this game? Don't give me the excuse of 'no money'. Save some up and buy it!) Though, for this type of game and what it has to offer... The price is a bit much for the game... That's probably the only REAL complaint I have about this game. But really, the same can be said about life in general.  So what are you waiting for? Your mother's credit card? Shame on you. Just buy the thing already!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Salahuddeen/recommended/545540,-1, The game is divided into five acts: the main problem is that you could remove acts two, three and four, and the game would be better for it. The set-up is intriguing but the middle bit is incoherent, with too many ideas that don't go anywhere. Then the ending just happens, and doesn't pick up on any of the ideas from the middle (which is why the middle ends up feeling like busywork).  Beware: there is very little detective-ing to do here.  It tries a &quot;Her Story&quot; approach to text input but the required prompts are either completely obvious (for the ones required to move the story along) or often arbitrary (for the optional ones). The arbitrary ones might have been fine, but unlocking the optional responses usually doesn't provide any useful insight, so there is little incentive.  If you're looking for FMV detective-ing, try &quot;Her Story&quot; or &quot;Contradiction&quot; instead.  PS: Haiku review So mediocre Did not do detective work 'Madness' by hint-spam

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043624655/recommended/641980,-1, After roughly 8 hours I'm not done with the game yet but I feel like I've seen enough to write a review. The game was very fun at first but the more I played the more tedious it got. I will still try to finish it but man is it taxing right now.  Overall the game looks and plays a bit like a crossover between Serious Sam and Minecraft. I picked up the game mostly because of it's graphics and I still dig them.  You spend most of your time mowing down hordes of enemies with various melee weapons and firearms in changing environments. The variety of weapons and enemies is big, which is a plus. The maps are fairly big as well, sometimes too big, but mostly pretty linear. The rest of the time you search for ressources to craft weapons, items and armour with. I never ran out of anything so far because the ressources are really plentiful. It took me a while to aquire good firearms but that didn't bother me that much since melee seems to be relevant throughout the whole game. Sadly that is all there is to do and it gets old pretty quickly. From the first level to the one I'm currently at the gameplay didn't change one bit. Moreover the game is just so damn easy, even later on. Yes, a couple of the bosses are no pushovers unlike the rest of the enemies and the traps are a hassle but everything else is a stroll through the park. Taking damage is no problem anyways since you have enough healing items to provide a whole army with it. There is some sort of hunger system as well but as of yet I really don't get what the point of it is. You find enough food in the game to solve world hunger so the system might as well not be there. Meanwhile the story is nonexistent. You're a guy who is stuck on some islands and kills everything that moves. The RPG elements are ok but I think you level up too quickly. I read somewhere that the level cap is 65 and I'm currently at level 62 so I will probably reach max level before finishing the playthrough. That makes me also wonder why there is a need for a new game +.  All in all I just can't recommend the game right now. My opinion could of course change once I am done with the game but at the moment I doubt that it will.  Edit 1: Level 65 most certainly is the max level, reached it way before the last level. Another thing that speaks for the game is that it runs very steady. No crashes and almost no bugs, Jumping is a bit choppy and some enemies in the later levels refused to die but that's about it.  TL;DR: Nice graphics, no story, monotonous gameplay, no recommendation. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/zaritonikarasz/recommended/221910,1, This is the kind of game where you get to follow the story or just deviate for your own fun.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Salahuddeen/recommended/653530,1, If any part of the premise interests you at all: definitely buy this. Also, don't be off by the visual style; screenshots don't do it justice and in-game looks great.  There's not much else similar to this out there, maybe &quot;Her Story&quot; or the &quot;Consulting Detective&quot; boardgames. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Salahuddeen/recommended/554620,-1, This is  very  different to Life is Strange, and feels like a visual novel (which would be fine if you could move text along, but you can't and the characters. speak. very. slowly. which makes watching this game an exercise in patience). As a prequel it fails to offer additional context to the first game: it doesn't build the characters more than we know from Life is Strange and doesn't address the events just prior to Life is Strange (for eg- &quot;Mr Jefferson and Rachel&quot; or &quot;Frank and Rachel&quot;). Worse; it barely manages to address events within  this  game (for eg-   the fire  ).  Overall, a huge disappointment. I had to watch the third episode on youtube because I couldn't stand the glacial pace at which characters speak. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Salahuddeen/recommended/558420,1, Gets a recommend because it does have a vision/concept and tries to execute it in new ways.  Note: the game is partly text based; unfortunately the text speed is glacially slow and there is no way to make the text appear any faster. Slow text is particularly annoying in episode 1 which is entirely text based.  However , in the rest of the episodes, the text speed is less obnoxious as there are additional things to do, so if you like the setting but are annoyed at the speed, at least try to stick it out past episode 1.  PS: Haiku review Just like Stranger Things But in video-game form Equally creepy

https://steamcommunity.com/id/xChazzar/recommended/228380,-1, i loved the game when i first got it, used to play it for hours and hours. and now they've removed so much of the content for... reasons. i've read other reviews that hopefully arent real, and that this game is still being looked at/looked after. it needs the content readding, and just a little tlc. dont make another game if you havent finished your first game. i will bad review this until they have readded or started showing interest in their game, would not suggest buying it unless you dont mind just doing laps bumping cars for hours on end on the same tracks or in reverse.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/lapisloserli/recommended/413150,1, Really captures the spirit of Harvest Moon and gets everything right that the series has been lacking. A must play for anything who's enjoyed the HM games and worth a shot if you haven't played them before. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/lapisloserli/recommended/331470,1, Real talk here. I wasn't expecting much from this game. It was free, I had a crappy laptop with the processing power of a potato, and I had a void left by Katawa Shoujo to fill, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I more or less got what I expected on my first route. It felt fairly generic. I didn't hate it, but still I didn't feel the need to play anymore either. A few months later, I decided to play another route on a whim, and had similar results. However this time I noticed something off about a scene that you play out every route with a different girl. It was just a minor change, but it gave off some serious ominous undertones. My interest was caught and I started another route. I don't want to say too much, after clearing several routes and getting the big picture, this game goes from generic VN to some Zero Escape-esque psychological sci-fi crap. I was not prepared for it, but I loved the curve balls this game threw at me. If you like VNs but looking for more than the standard trashy dating sim, give it some patience and Everlasting Summer can surprise you. Also, there's an H-patch if you want to see boobs. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/konata64/recommended/252490,1, This game is great. It's like Minecraft met DayZ and threw you into a random terrain and you must survive with what you got. The only problem is making &quot;friends&quot; can be difficult because 95% of the time some kid or heartless being will kill you for no reason or blow up your home while you just crafted that new furnace you just got enough material to build. I know this from expirence, and it was a sad day while getting spawn killed by 13 year olds getting a giggle from killing a naked dude holding a rock hitting a tree. Overall the game is great on an empty or more &quot;mature&quot; server where younger players can't disturb older users gameplay. I highly suggest you to buy this game if you love an open world zombie survival that will keep you on your toes with suspence in the gameplay so buy this amazing and fun game. Good work Garry! :) *Brofist*

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041528015/recommended/732290,1,  Note: So far I only played 4 of the presumably 7 chapters.    Schatte ¡«The Witch and the Fake Shadow¡«  is by no means a must-play title, and there are a lot better games out there. But I'd say it's alright, it has some interesting and unique mechanics, and I enjoyed it so far, aside from some initial needless frustration.  The story is simple: The Shadow Demon had been sealed away, but eventually broke free, and now takes control of animate beings. For some reason, Schatte, the main character, is unaffected. As a wielder of shadow magic, she heads out to help survivors, and to stop the contamination.  To use shadow magic, Schatte needs to generate a shadow first. She can do this by positioning her familiar, a bat with a jack o'lantern head that emits light. She can then interact with shadows in several ways to stun a target, stabilize a movable object, cure a possessed creature, control a creature to borrow its abilities, or dive into the shadow of an object to either climb slopes, or to pass unharmed through obstacles.  The game itself is fairly linear, and a level mostly consists of walking from the start point to an unspecified target location, while fighting possessed creatures, or solving puzzles with different kinds of shadow magic. There are some optional collectible objects in the form of journey entries or other documents, but they are usually easy to find.  Once you have figured out the basic mechanics, most fights so far are rather straightforward: Lock the light source to the enemy, throw a Shadow Knife into its shadow to stun it, then jump once or more on its shadow to cure it. Things become slightly more difficult when confronting multiple enemies at the same time, and there was at least one considerably more difficult boss fight. But since Schatte gains experience / levels, there's no reason to be concerned about a too high difficulty.  The puzzles are usually simple, but it still can take a while or some experimentation to find the solution.   What I didn't like about the game:   There's no options menu, except for the unity dialog at launch, which at least allows to choose a resolution / quality setting, and look up / change the controls.   Many parts of the first levels look very bland. But it gets better later.   Maybe it's just me, but at the beginning I had a hard time understanding some of the basic mechanics. In particular, I didn't understand which terms refer to buttons / keys (e.g.  Shadow Stamp ), and which terms refer to actions associated with those (e.g.  Shadow Bind ), and that I was supposed to tap a certain button / key.   There's only a single save state, and the game automatically saves at certain points. That means if you accidentally select  Start  instead of  Continue  in the main menu, you have to play certain parts of the game again. While there is a Chapter select option, it doesn't allow to select single levels within this chapter, and you cannot return to the main menu once you have entered this sub-menu; so if you select this, you either have to replay the whole chapter, or force-quit the game (I haven't tried this, so do this at your own risk!) Fortunately, character level and collectibles are not reset when replaying a chapter.   You can die at a certain part in the tutorial level  before  the game saves for the first time. This can easily happen if you didn't understand some of the instructions, and when this happens you have to replay the whole tutorial with the not-completely-skippable dialogs.  While those issues can lead to some initial frustration, the game plays fine once you know how to deal with those / are familiar with the basic mechanics.   All in all, I'd recommend the game if...   ...you're looking for a small relaxing indie game with a witch theme, and some unique mechanics   ...you don't mind the lack of sound options, or in-game graphics / control settings   ...you are confident in your ability to navigate menues w/o accidentally selecting options that reset some of your level progress   ...you can handle some potential initial frustration (ymmv, maybe I just didn't pay enough attention)   ...you don't need achievements or trading cards   
https://steamcommunity.com/id/xChazzar/recommended/381210,1, really enjoyed the game and could see hours of never ending fun with a group of friends as survivors, otherwise sometimes to play as a killer you have to endure a long.. long wait to find a lobby.  
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041528015/recommended/811910,1,  Note: This review is based on singleplayer mode   MRS SNAKE is a take on Flying Snake, which in turn is a 3D version of the original Snake games.  The gameplay is simple: You are a snake in a restricted 3D area in space, and you have to eat items to get longer. You receive damage over time, or if you hit obstacles, and the only way to stay alive is to keep eating items, which replenishes some health. The longer you become, the more difficult it is to avoid crashing into yourself. If you die, you get a score based on your length.  While the concept is simple, it is also a rather unique game, and well-executed, making it a fun little score chaser:   The growth rate is tuned well, and you don't spend too much time moving through an empty area   The starvation mechanic forces you to take risks and make quick decisions, instead of encouraging boring, but more safe strategies   The close-up 3rd person view with transparent snake head shows just enough that the gameplay is interesting, and obstacles never block your view in an awkward way   Using the camera to look for nearby items while not crashing into your tail is a neat skill to improve   The arcade-style runs are open-ended, and there's always room for self-improvement. Unlike the original snake games, you won't run into a situation where you cannot move anymore unless you are  really  good   The minimalist and geometrically-themed look fits the game perfectly, w/o making it more performance-heavy than necessary. I particularly like the way it looks when parts of your tail move in different directions   Gamepad support seems decent: No XInput required, and a large list of gamepads is supported. The developer seems to be active and has already improved some things based on user feedback. And even if a gamepad isn't detected correctly, there's a text file in the game folder which I assume can be modified to make it work   While the game is probably designed to be played with an analog stick, I slightly prefer to use my D-pad for quicker turns, so an analog input device is by no means required.  The specified high GPU requirements seem to assume a certain number of players, but for singleplayer or only a few players, it can be played with a much older GPU (performance seems to scale with the number of views).  I like the music, which reminds me of old experimental synthesizer stuff, but this game is just perfect for listening to your own music. Fortunately, music and sound effects can be enabled / disabled separately.  While I haven't played the (local) multiplayer mode, I would assume that it is fun: The game is plug and play, simple to learn, supports up to 8 players via split-screen, and has decent gamepad support. I also heard there are multiplayer-exclusive power-ups that you can use against each other.   Conclusion  While the game is simple, I find it quite enjoyable once in a while, particularly when I want to listen to some music, or if I feel like playing an avoid 'em up type of game, but want something more relaxing than a bullet hell shoot 'em up. It's well executed, it's one of a kind, the developer seems to respond to feedback, it's cheap, plug and play, has good gamepad support, and I assume multiplayer is fun.  My only complaint is that there are no online leaderboards, and gameplay could be a bit more varied in singleplayer mode. Also, online multiplayer would be a nice option. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/YuriShadows/recommended/310080,1, This is a game that I have recommended to a lot of my friends, and they've all loved it as much as I have. It has a silly premise, but it's a really enjoyable game.   What really makes this game so great (besides finally making your dream of having a bird boyfriend come true) is the true ending. I wouldn't want to spoil too much because the less you know the better it will be, just prepare for the game to take a turn.   The game goes cheap in the sales so you can force all of your friends to love birds as much as you do. I mean, who wouldn't want to spend hours arguing over who is the best bird boy?    tl;dr Moa is a genius. Get out there and date pigeons. Make all your friends date pigeons. All hail our bird overlords! Coo coo!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/ribose5/recommended/282800,1, This might be a hard sell for some friends of mine, but I've spent over a thousand hours on this game because it's a fun little time-waster in multiplayer with a decent amount of strategy involved. It's also cute. But, at the same time, the developers update it with content every few months, showing their absolute dedication to bringing players back. It's a board game that will either ruin your friendships, or if you can tolerate a salty diet, make them.  All DLC adds content but it's not required to get it to enjoy the game. Most DLC are character packs that provide two characters which tend to offer a very unique strategy, especially more lately. It's all about the high-risk high-reward characters for me. There are also DLC packs that add voices, which are not required but are certainly something to get on sale for a little flavor. Point is, all other cosmetics are free and are gotten by playing more matches and receiving them through in-game stars, oranges, or events that last a month every season. The base game without DLC gives you access to 12 characters (and 6 enemy characters, but they're just gimmicks and not very good), unlockable by playing. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041528015/recommended/416380,1, This is, hands down, one of my favorite bullet hell games so far!  The player can choose between 4 ships with different shot patterns and stats. There are also 2 unlockable ships that seem to have the same stats as existing ships.  The ship controls in this vertical shoot 'em up are highly responsive, with a Touhou-style focus/slow button that allows for precise movement. Aside from the main shot, there are secondary weapons that can be useful in certain situations, and the Baryon Laser, which is explained below.  The main gameplay can be summed up as following: - shoot enemies to fill up the Baryon Laser gauge - when the gauge is full, activate the Baryon Laser - this turns enemies and bullets into items that fill the Grabuster gauge when collected - after some time, you enter Grabuster mode, which lasts until the gauge depletes  In Grabuster mode (or Gravastar, the translation is inconsistent), the ship is surrounded by what looks like a small black hole, and turns into a weapon that can be moved quickly across the screen, while damaging everything it touches. The above cycle is tied into the score system, and you can maximize your score by planning when to activate the Baryon Laser, when to pick up items that fill those gauges, and by prioritizing certain targets over others in Grabuster mode (-&gt; increase the multiplier before destroying larger enemies that are worth more points).  Getting hit activates a shield for a few seconds, and prevents you from losing a life at the cost of some Baryon Laser energy, if you have enough. However, this is risky and worse than using the gauge for the Baryon Laser, so it's more of a safeguard with a major drawback.  The patterns in this game are very basic, consisting of aimed and static shots / bullet clusters, which sometimes rotate or expand slightly. So it's less about memorizing fancy bullet patterns, and more about navigating quickly through static bullet patterns while avoiding or guiding aimed shots, and trying not to get cornered by dense bullet curtains. The colorful bullets can be easily distinguished from the background, with some rare exceptions. To make things more interesting, the game encourages horizontal movement by making the stage slightly wider than the play area, and with visible or hidden ground targets that provide items or collectibles.  The bosses are basically floating platforms with a main core, and attack turrets as optional targets. While the bosses themselves aren't very unique, the fights are somewhat interesting because the player has the option to either play it safe, or destroy all turrets, which will spawn sets of stronger turrets, and allows for a higher score.  With 12 stages, the game is quite long for an arcade shoot 'em up, and there's an entire second loop with more difficult stage variants in Arcade mode, while Story mode offers plenty of dialog, and some lengthy unlockable endings.  The story centers on a squad of 4 pilots, who have to face a fearful enemy, and deal with a conspiracy, which is complicated by the role and background of each pilot, and by some outsiders that become involved later. There are some anime cliches, along with US / Hollywood cliches, and some explicit language, reminding me a bit of Black Lagoon. ;) I generally liked the story, especially for setting the mood or making me care about the characters, though sometimes it was a bit hard to follow (mediocre translation / alternate drawing style in endings), silly, or overly dramatic.  Apart from Story and Arcade mode, there's also a practice and a caravan mode. If that's not enough, a DLC with 4 additional stages / 2 loops and another story mode can be purchased.  What makes this game great IMO is the unique gameplay which ... just feels right as a whole, just like the gameplay in Eschatos, Crimzon Clover, Trouble Witches or Murasaki. It's hard to explain, so I'd recommend to just try the demo. ;) In addition, I'm completely addicted to the soundtrack, which was the reason why I bought the game in the first place. :)   However, the game has some considerable flaws: - no graphic settings besides window / fullscreen (only 1280x720) - either vsync with noticable input delay, or no vsync with noticable screen tearing, no in-game vsync option - w/o vsync, game may set the framerate to the monitor refresh rate (e.g. can run at 144 instead of 60 fps) - mediocre English translation - small main game area in case of non-widescreen monitor - in rare cases, the game freezes for a moment - no replays - 8 achievements seem to be unobtainable(?) - the Start button on a gamepad cannot be remapped  While many of those should be fixed, it doesn't affect my experience too much: Window mode works for me, I don't mind the screen tearing or changing the monitor refresh rate, I'm usually not able to get all achievements in a bullet hell game anyway, and the freezes are rare and hardly affect gameplay. What bothers me most is that the main game occupies only a small area of my non-widescreen monitor, but it's still highly playable thanks to the excellent bullet visibility, except for higher difficulty levels where it can become a pain.  It's also noteworthy that the game has unlimited continues, and using a continue does not reset the score. There's a reward for avoiding death, but there doesn't seem to be a strong penalty for dying a lot compared to dying once during a boss fight, and I wouldn't be surprised if this could be slightly exploited. I'm not an expert, though, and I don't know how much potential for a boring exploit there is. If this bothers someone, there's at least the option to refuse to continue, and ignore scores that don't have a zero at the end.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/wudotis/recommended/440,1, THIS GAME IS AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/BooCakie/recommended/589360,1, A pretty ok game. Worth it at 50% off. Did the new pokemon finding system of combat before the new pokemon 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/YuriShadows/recommended/282800,1, One of my favorite games on Steam even after all these years.  The game is constantly updated releasing new characters, cosmetics, maps, campaigns, and events.  While it may have a lot of rng to it, it's hard to get seriously mad at it with how cheerful, colorful, and casual the game is.  It has a lot of wonderful characters that it'd be pretty hard to not find one that you love &lt;3 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/YuriShadows/recommended/415850,1, The game is pretty short. Only takes about 1-2 hours to finish it.  While the story isn't anything amazing, it is still pretty interesting and fun to go through. It has plenty of endings (Many of them are pretty much the same), The music is pretty good, and I adore the artwork.  For the price, I think it's a great game, that you should play if you're looking for something short and interesting.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041528015/recommended/429700,1,   Disclaimer:  A number of players reported a bug where they can't play the game, because they get a black screen when trying to start a new game. I didn't encounter this bug, but if you buy the game, I recommend to check if there's a problem, so you can refund the game withing 2 weeks of purchase if necessary.    Squirbs is a platformer with an interesting twist: You control two characters at the same time, which will respond equally to your inputs. So if you jump, both characters jump, and if you move right, both characters move to the right. For each character, there is a crystal shard in each level, and you need to get very close to them with both characters at the same time to finish a level.  The levels can feature some simple puzzle elements like crates or switches, but usually the actual puzzle involves planning a path for both characters, moving one character freely while the other one is blocked by a wall, preventing one character from jumping by pressing &lt;jump&gt; while that character (but not the other one) is in the air, planning when to best switch your focus between both characters, and so on. Later levels introduce teleporters, surfaces that influence your movement, and other interesting level elements.  The controls are responsive, and you move / stop as soon as you press or release a button or keyboard key. Jump height can be controlled precisely by releasing the &lt;jump&gt; button/key sooner or later. The only thing I don't like here is that you can't jump while holding &lt;down&gt;, but I only remember one level where that became relevant, and I beat it after adapting my strategy.  So, is this a good game? Well, I greatly enjoyed this game, and would definitely answer that with a 'yes' for me! :)  However, there are two important things to consider:   1) The platforming in this game becomes very technical / difficult starting after world 1 of 4, requiring you to make precise inputs in order to avoid a mistake that means instant death, so it becomes comparable to Super Robot Jump Jump, Super Meat Boy, I Wanna Be The Guy, the bonus levels in the Escape Goat games, or Kaizo Mario World. However, there are no hidden traps, and each level consists of a single screen and takes less than a minute (often only a few seconds) if you don't make any mistakes, so it's still very much doable for ambitious players.  2) The game is a bit unpolished: Gamepads are supported via XInput, but you can't navigate the options menu with a gamepad, or use it to skip a story screen that you will only see once / the intro screen. Also, if you have a smaller resolution (I think the game is designed with 1080p in mind), the downscaling doesn't look as nice as it could, and button icons or numbers are sometimes hard to recognize. Another thing I noticed is that physics don't seem to be 100% deterministic on a slower PC, so it can happen that one character is a pixel further to the right than the other character after walking half a screen width, despite a symmetrical level layout. However, this was only rarely a cause for failing, so it was mostly negligible for me. I was also a bit disappointed that there was no ending, but at least there's some satisfaction thanks to the achievements for completing it.   Some other reviewers claim that it becomes just mindless trial and error after some point. I can not confirm this: For example, the wall jump mechanics that can be found later are implemented in a clever way where you vertically jump if you press the jump button (no directional buttons required) while adjacent to a wall. A smart player will make use of the option to wall jump without moving the other character, while a player that relies on mindless trial and error will fail in many situations where such subtleties are relevant for success. So thinking is definitely rewarded. ;)   ------------------------------------------  If you like frustratingly hard games and can look past those flaws, or like to try out games with an innovative concept, I think it's definitely worth it.  Also, if you waver because of the high difficulty, you can still consider picking it up and just play world 1 when the game is at a discount that justifies something between 30 minutes and an hour of playtime. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041528015/recommended/282800,1, 100% Orange Juice is a fantastic online boardgame for up to 4 players, with characters from the developer's other games (Suguri/Sora series, QP/Xmas Shooting series, Flying Red Barrel, 200% Mixed Juice).  The game has a silly over-the-top humor, with seagulls that fly across the board to attack other players, a hamster-like character that speaks in a foreign language and likes to rob others, and a female Santa Claus with rabbit ears who fends off attackers by hitting them with her present bag. In short: It's a lot of fun, unless you somehow hate anime, or cute characters.  What I like the most about this game (aside from the humor) is its perfect balance between strategical depth and RNG: On one hand, analyzing the parameters over which the player has control can be quite interesting, and you can spend a lot of time with meta analysis, if you like doing this. On the other hand, there are a lot of things that are outside the player's control. While you can gain a bit of an edge with smart decisions, you're still at the mercy of the RNG. Put together, this makes for a game that can be enjoyable for both strategists and casual players, without being too onesided. And if you like roguelikes, you're probably happy to read that the game can throw you in a lot of different situations, where you have to improvise with the &quot;items&quot; (cards) on your hand in creative ways, or make an educated guess.  At its core, the game is quite simple: Players take turns, and roll a D6 to move forward on the board, and the panel they land on determines if they gain or lose stars, draw a card, or if other things happen. Players can also battle other players, allowing them to steal their stars and gain points if they KO them. To win, players need to level up a certain number of times by landing on a player home panel with the required stars or battle points.  While this may sound a bit boring, there's much more beyond this. First of all, the game has a very interesting deck mechanic, where players create or choose a deck of 10 cards before the start of a game. However, the cards from all players are shuffled into a common deck. So, to build an efficient deck, you can't just add cards that are good for your character; you also have to consider how bad (or good) it is if other players draw those cards, which, btw., is the far more likely outcome with 4 players. The cast of characters is quite diverse, with each character having different stats, an exclusive hyper card that (usually) only this character can draw, and sometimes a passive ability. The character diversity results in very different playing styles or card synergies, which keeps the game fresh.  The battle system is simple, yet elegant: The challenger rolls a D6 for attack, and the challenged player chooses to defend or evade, before rolling a D6. Then roles swap, and the challenged player is allowed to counterattack. The rolls are modified by the character stats, potentially played start-of-battle cards, and sometimes other factors. Since character stats are very small numbers, it's possible to estimate the risk of challenging another player quite well, except for potential cards that the other player may play.  Now, the battle system is a bit more than just a gimmick thrown into the game for some forced chaotic interaction: Some characters are good attackers, while others are good defenders, or star gatherers (which is a bit of an oversimplification). In addition, characters pose more or less of a threat depending on their HP, card hand, character level, board position, and how much they need your stars. Sometimes it's safer to attack someone, because passing them would allow them to attack first. Sometimes, you want to attack someone, because it allows you to stop on their panel. And sometimes you don't want to pass another player, because you know the other player will attack you to land on your panel.  There's a lot more to say about the game mechanics, like thoughtful pathing, resource management (cards vs stars), and the many ways cards and active events have an impact on the game. Figuring out how to build a good deck for certain characters, or to play them well can be an interesting, non-trivial challenge.  But, as mentioned at the beginning, there's only so much that a player can influence: While the game has a lot of depth, playing well is often countered by bad luck, and vice-versa. If you expect that the best player wins, this is not the game for you. If you enjoy meta analysis, and are pleased to win slightly more often if you play well, you might enjoy this game. And if you just want to have some silly fun while chatting with other players, without having to think too much about the deeper aspects, this game has you covered.   While the game has a singleplayer mode, I mostly played it to unlock some things, for a challenge, and to try out things offline. The AI is very limited: It gets most of the basic things right, but plays cards completely randomly, and makes poor risk management decisions. In the singleplayer campaign, the difficulty setting determines how much the AI player rolls are rigged (the final boss even makes a comment about this ^_^). You can get some enjoyment out of singleplayer mode, but it probably won't last long.   The developers / publishers seem to care a lot about the game, are active on the community boards, and keep updating the game with bug fixes, new characters and voices, or seasonal events with special rules and obtainable cosmetics, and so on.  My experience while playing with strangers has been good -- particularly during seasonal events -- and finding new friends to play with isn't difficult with this community.  Regarding DLC: There is a lot of DLC, but IMO the only essential DLCs are the two card packs. The (Japanese) voice packs are worth it as QoL features, if you care about this. For new players, the base game already has a lot of characters (18, some of which have to be unlocked). So the character DLCs aren't necessary, and I exclusively played base game characters for a long time, even though I owned some of the DLC characters (which often are a bit more difficult to play for someone who is new to the game). Note that two character DLCs (Breaker &amp; Witch Pack) add a new campaign, each, in case this is important for you. While I ended up buying all DLC, I did it because I wanted it, and not because I felt I needed it to enjoy the game, and because I wanted to support the developer / publisher.  The only two bad things I can think of off the top of my head (ignoring minor issues) are: 1) The manual is outdated, confusing, and contains a crucial mistake that caused me to misunderstand one of the core mechanics. But there's a good beginner's guide on Steam, and the game has a link to an extensive wiki. 2) It takes some time to unlock all cards and characters. I personally don't care about the latter, but I found it a bit annoying that I couldn't just freely build my deck for a tank character, until I unlocked several rare HP recovery cards, which are more or less mandatory for such a character.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041528015/recommended/342610,1, Here's finally my review of Hyperrogue, probably my favorite game on Steam! :)  In a nutshell, Hyperrogue can be described as a minimalist tactical roguelike in the hyperbolic plane. So, what does that mean, specifically?  First of all, it's a minimalist roguelike, and there is no equipment, and no items except for Orbs (basically spells) which are often activated upon pick up. Hyperrogue is turn- and grid-based, and combat rules are simple: Every attack is guaranteed to hit, and is usually deadly - for monsters as well as for the player. As a roguelike, it has permadeath. To avoid accidental player deaths, the game prevents you from performing actions that immediately result in your death, though there's a hardcore mode for the more confident players. Basically, the goal is to collect as much treasure as possible in different game modes, either in total, or for a specific type of treasure. In addition, there are some very challenging quests (most of which would be easy in a Euclidean setting), and a lot of achievements and leaderboard categories.  The game is easy to pick up, but difficult to master, and is suitable for anyone from casual players to science nerds or hardcore players. However, be warned that there are no difficulty modes, so it can be frustrating, and you won't be able to unlock certain game modes (chaos mode, Orb of Yendor challenge mode) unless you're very ambitious. Also, you have to be a top player to legally get 100% achievements.  About the more unusual aspect: Hyperrogue is the only elaborate game that I know which features hyperbolic geometry, a type of non-Euclidean geometry! To give a short explanation for this weird kind of geometry, I start with the other (more intuitive) type of non-Euclidean geometry, elliptic geometry: 2-dimensional elliptic geometry is simply the surface of a sphere. So if inhabitants of Earth couldn't move up or down, they'd be living in an elliptic plane. As a grid, we could combine regular hexagons and pentagons in a way that 2 hexagons and 1 pentagon meet in a vertex, which gives us a &quot;football&quot;. Euclidean geometry is the &quot;normal&quot; geometry we're used to, and the Euclidean plane is simply a flat surface. For a grid we can use regular hexagons. Now hyperbolic geometry is kind of special: While we can combine regular hexagons and pentagons to get a (positively curved) plane, a possible grid for hyperbolic geometry consists of regular hexagons and heptagons, making it &quot;negatively curved&quot;. If we try to do that in the Euclidean world we are living in, we get a wrinkled surface resembling the structure of corals, and it gets more extreme the larger the structure becomes, to the point where our Euclidean universe can't handle the non-Euclidean madness. However, Hyperrogue uses another method of representation (see Poincar¨¦ disk model), the same which you see in M. C. Escher's  Circle Limit  patterns: In this kind of representation, cells appear smaller the further away they are from the center, and quickly become too small to display on the screen. But if we travel to those cells, we'll see they're the same size as other cells. :)  An interesting property of hyperbolic geometry is that space extends more quickly, and you could fit the surface area of Earth in a circle with a comparably small radius. As a consequence, walking a few steps, and then walking back in the approximately (but not exactly) same direction will likely cause you to end up in an entirely different place, so it's very easy to get lost! Another consequence is that escaping pursuers is easier: Head towards a seemingly small gap between two pursuers, and that gap will turn out to be larger than expected! Also, there is no exact equivalent to &quot;parallels&quot; in a Euclidean geometry, and if your pursuers try to walk in parallel, the outer ones have to travel a larger distance, and will fall back, conveniently lining up for you to defeat them one-by-one. On the other hand, running into unexplored territory means a lot of cells are quickly revealed, potentially containing lots of monsters.  Another interesting aspect is that you can have a hub land with quick access to many infinitely large lands without using teleporters, or a waypoint system. :) The world of Hyperrogue consists of such hub lands, and lots of other different lands with their own kind of treasure. Each land has some unique mechanics, and plays very differently, often requiring an entirely different approach. For example, the starting land - Icy land - has heat-based mechanics, there's a land where the ground vanishes beneath your feet, and there's another (cellular automaton-based) land where the walls have a life of their own, and you have to be careful not to get trapped.  The game is being actively developed, and new lands and game modes are released with major updates: Currently, there are 37 regular and 4 hub lands, which is a lot more than the first Steam release had! Also, the (small) community is very active, and there's probably always a friendly person who will help you if you are stuck, have questions, or just want to discuss several aspects of the game. Also, the developer has been very open to suggestions, and is eager to fix reported bugs, and keep the leaderboards &quot;clean&quot; in case there are obvious cheaters. A drawback is that major updates often introduce a considerable number of bugs, but with the excellent bug fix support they usually don't persist long after being reported.  The game currently has the following modes:   The standard mode where you can collect treasure to unlock more lands, and attempt several quests   Collecting a certain amount of treasure unlocks the respective land in the pure tactics mode, where you can try to get highscores in individual lands w/o using items or monsters from other lands   There's a cheat mode that also gives you access to map editor tools, and lets you experiment with hyperbolic patterns.    In the random pattern mode, lands appear with unusual floor/wall patterns. This mode is not well-balanced, but it can lead to some interesting and fun situations   The Euclidean mode features Euclidean versions of the basic lands, which is interesting if you want to find out which impact the unusual geometry has on the game   You can print a sheet to create a warped paper model of a scene from the game, and there's a mode where the game simulates such a paper model (remember what I mentioned about corals, and trying to embed the hyperbolic plane in our Euclidean world?)   The shmup mode removes grid restrictions and is real-time, allowing for local coop with up to 4 players (I didn't try this mode much)   The heptagonal mode allows you to explore the world of Hyperrogue using a different grid that is a bit simpler (only heptagons), but where the hyperbolic aspect is much stronger   Collecting a lot of treasure unlocks the chaos mode, where lands are more dense and w/o walls / hub lands, leading to some interesting interactions   For very ambitious players who manage to clear the Orb of Yendor or Prince(ss) quest, there are related quest modes. Especially the OoY challenge mode is noteworthy!   The soundtrack is released under a Creative Commons license, and the game comes with the source code, in case you care about that.  If you're unsure about buying: You can download a slightly older, free version of the game (along with the source code) from the developer's homepage, which should give you a good impression what the game has to offer. However, don't forget that it neither has leaderboards, nor Steam achievements, which are IMhO important aspects of the playing experience. The price is IMO far below the game's worth, but that's a very subjective point; still, I think the price has always been very fair given how unique the game is, and how well it is supported. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/cowmage/recommended/221910,1, I honestly can't come up with language adequate to recommend this game. Partly this is because the game is best experienced without real prior knowledge of what's going on; partly this is because words cannot do justice to the excellence of the game. I suppose I wouldn't recommend that this be anyone's first game, but anyone who is already a gamer and doesn't play The Stanley Parable is doing themselves a great disservice. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/cowmage/recommended/346850,-1, If you played this game on a Win98 computer, all the nostalgia is right there. But, y'know, slightly updated so you don't have to keep passcodes for levels (I *think* the original had that). Two bucks for a nostalgia trip? Sure. If you're actually reading reviews or paying attention to the rating to decide whether to purchase this game, then there probably isn't going to be a nice thick blanket of nostalgia hiding all of the flaws, and there are sadly many.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/cowmage/recommended/382490,1, I genuinely wish I could refund about six similar games in my library and spend that money on this one. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/cowmage/recommended/248820,1, Beautifully atmospheric, with a lot of gameplay depth and a quiet sense of humor. Definitely not easy, but not unfair either. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/cowmage/recommended/406150,1, Beautiful, simple, cathartic, wonderful. A demonstration of just how little it takes to make an excellent game. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/BooCakie/recommended/763410,1, One of the best games I own 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/kejebra/recommended/282800,1, You need to be aware of three things when playing this game: 1. The dice hates you, and it always will. 2. Your best friends are your worst enemies (sometimes by accident). 3. No one likes Marie Poppo. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/BooCakie/recommended/436180,-1, Matchmaking is ????ed. Two level 6's and a 10 vs a 182. Real fun is had. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/BooCakie/recommended/891730,-1, It's a joke that this is the Deluxe Edition and they come out with stuff that should have been in this after launch. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/scandalousboi69/recommended/72850,1, very good 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/kaigero/recommended/282800,1, Very fun and challenging game even tho the dices were pretty rng based :3 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/scandalousboi69/recommended/406150,1, best game on the market imo. honestly if it was longer it could be a 10$ game. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/scandalousboi69/recommended/225540,1, Seriously, pick this game up while it's on sale. Had a ton of fun with it on xbone and picked it up for a fair price of 13$. Now, the thing everyone gave this game a negative review for, the unoptimization, did not affect me at all. I'm able to run 4k at high/ultra settings with no aa or pp 70 fps perfectly. Honestly it's not fair that such a fun game is getting overlooked like this. In fact, I'm going to set up a 6600k+1060 bench rig and test this game to see if it really is unoptimized. I'll edit this when I do.  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/cowmage/recommended/16730,1, I strongly recommend this game. It's got its flaws - almost all being that there's not enough content, which for its price as I write this ($3) is hardly a legitimate complaint. But it's solidly fun, and has a great concept. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/scandalousboi69/recommended/292030,1, 10/10 around 50 hrs in game (i play offline alot) i finally finished the main quest line, and i have'nt even started eaiter of the dlc. Amazing storytelling, gameplay, combat, graphics, and voice acting. Soundtrack is super (not as good os skyrim however). Characters are 10/10 and the progression/development of the characters is outstanding. paid full price for the base game, yet to buy the dlc, but definatly would reccomend even without dlc

https://steamcommunity.com/id/scandalousboi69/recommended/65790,1, its pretty old, but to be honest, its not a bad game. It takes a while to get used to, and the graphics, well lets not get started on them. Lets just say that from arma cold was assault to arma 3 was a   BIG   leap.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/scandalousboi69/recommended/437220,-1, Couldn't launch the game. Will change review when its fixed (for me at least) 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/static989/recommended/406150,1,   Scores             ART        6/10              MUSIC        8/10              GAMEPLAY        8/10              OVERALL        7/10       ============================================================  Refunct is a simple, relaxing platformer that for its price delivers. What it lacks in story and visuals is salvaged by the satisfying gameplay and mellow soundtrack. If you're looking for something quick and simple with the option to crank up the difficulty through speedrunning/achievement hunting while sticking to a budget this might be the game for you. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/wildgoosespeeder/recommended/406150,-1, MEANDERS is better:   https://store.steampowered.com/app/734920   This is way too minimalistic. Waste of time and money. MEANDERS has a lot more meat to it and the environment is mostly the same with Refunct.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/wildgoosespeeder/recommended/501220,1, For my first Early Access game, this is pretty darn good. Not a bad way to go for $1 during the Steam Summer Sale. There does exist some balancing issues, which can make the game frustrating at times, but overall, it is all I ever hoped for in this game as an Early Access title. It's a good way to start. Oh, and the demo doesn't do the game justice. Developer, please remove the demo or update it please!  If you start a race with a mouse/keyboard, it locks you out of the Xinput controls (such as an Xbox 360 or Xbox One controller). It doesn't allow you to switch on-the-fly or on-demand. You either have to exit the Grand Prix or restart the game to make sure to use the other control scheme. My prefered method of control is a controller, not keyboard/mouse.  Racing is mostly stable, except for a few instances where spinning out is rather easy to do, when you don't expect your racer to do, or the AI force you to easily spin out. The idea is to go fast, but to do that, you need to slipstream your opponents from behind, charging a meter. The longer you do, the faster you go. I find it rather hard to keep my car continuously slipstreaming. On the other hand, the AI is rather too good at it, which leads to unfair slingshotting or rubberbanding moments. If the track bends downward for a long period of time, it can be hard to spot road hazards. A warning queue would be nice. Weapons available in certain cups feel like a last minute addition, or if implemented for a while, never revisited.  The interface could use some work. It doesn't save the last vehicle used or it's upgrades between computers (using cloud saves). Also, the menu to restart a race, you can accidentally end a Grand Prix because no confirmation yes/no dialog appears. Also wished a vsync option existed. Also a speedometer would also be nice. The slipstream meter isn't exactly a speedometer.  A track feature I hope to see is a &quot;dash plate&quot;. It can charge the slipstream meter like 1/4 or 1/5. Hopefully LAN play is implemented, because I know that finding people online to play this game will be a challenge due to the low popularity of this game (that I wished was more popular).  It's a Unity game that runs well at 30FPS on budget computers. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/wildgoosespeeder/recommended/265830,1, This game is even more depressing than LIMBO. That's not about the gameplay but rather the tone and themes. The gameplay is fantastic. The theme and tone are depressing, but have bizarre moments that keep it from dragging on too long.   The ending can make those that can get emotional cry, seeing the player character commit suicide on a blimp to save his younger brother from the clutches of some sort of evil empire experimenting on innocent kids.    Game works great on a GeForce GTX 1050. 60FPS. This Unity game was sluggish on my laptop sporting a GeForce 610M, dropping as low as 5FPS in some places! Good game! Just needs a good system spec to play smoothly. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/wildgoosespeeder/recommended/441870,1, It's a bare bones game where the main hook is 80s MIDI music and you drive for as long as possible. The soundtrack is amazing. I learned about artists that I didn't knew existed before this game. However, with such a great soundtrack, it is a waste that no soundtest mode exists with this game.  Just thinking about it, maybe a suspension option would be great. Also, I wish that game controller remappings were saved between sessions. The defaults are crippling.  Overall, not a bad way to spend 50 cents, the sale price.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/scandalousboi69/recommended/440,1, It took me 513 hours to realize that this game is COMPLETELY POINTLESS. 9/11. Would not buy even though its f2p 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/4453776/recommended/440,1, Tf2 is an amazing game.  It's great for both competitive and casual players.  I have have spent nearly 2k hours on tf2 alone and I still can't find a word other than perfection. (Not all people may agree to this statement)  There is so much content, years upon years of developement and care from both the developers and the community. Best of all there is no pay to win system. Every item can be obtain via the drop system, contracts, and trading. All weapons are fair and balanced, giving priority to the stock weapons you have at the beginning. It's easy to pick up and extemely hard to master, I have 2k hours and I'm only an amature. The community and the game have been through some tough times and I know that soon the game will be back on it's feet being the shining beacon for new players in the gaming industry as it once was. I can't list everything that makes tf2 so special, so I highly encourage you to do some research by yourself and see the game in it's purest form.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/wildgoosespeeder/recommended/224460,1, This game has a very dark, but vibrant, atmosphere: Dark with theme, vibrant with colors and lighting. Lighting and shadows play a role in this game's platforming mechanics. However, the camera controls can get in the way. I spent a good amount of time fighting the camera. Also, the camera is too close to the player character, making some jumps difficult and sometimes not being able to switch between 2D and 3D platforming.. I feel a good comparison for a good 3rd person camera is from Super Mario Sunshine. Left and right moves the camera left and right. Up and down zooms in and out. In Contrast, Up and down rotates the camera up and down, causing overhead or undernose camera pointing, which is pointless in this game. Also,  no way to invert the camera controls on a controller. Also the jumping controls can be a little floaty.  Overall, not a bad way to go for a game that I spent $3 on when it was on sale. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/wildgoosespeeder/recommended/258520,1, I played the redux version. It ran mostly smoothly on my GeForce GTX 1050. 60FPS and a few times where it dipped below that. I was under the impression this would be a straight &quot;walking simulator&quot; game, but the game is more involved than that. It's a murder mystery where you play as a psychic detective where you solve small puzzles and try to recreate crime scenes, and it is executed pretty well. Just when you think the world imakes sense, it throws you a curveball, and it makes the game all the more engaging.  There is a jump scare maze towards the end of the game, and you need to complete it for 100% completion, and it is random when the jumpscares happen, and you have to find all dead corpses to stop the jump scares, which I found myself wandering around aimlessly trying to find everything. I felt this didn't match up with the rest of the game's themes. There is also a spot where you need to throw a grenade into the river, and there is no clear way to know that is what you need to do! The ending is a pretty cool plot twist. You are a creation of Ethan Carter's vivid imagination, and the setting was all just in his mind!  It's worth a play, despite a few flaws, but only if the game is on sale. You get both the original and redux versions when you buy, and I recommend the redux version, as backtracking is much easier  when you find Ethan. Portals to the various points in the game were added.   
https://steamcommunity.com/id/wildgoosespeeder/recommended/250260,1, What did I just play? Is the game insane or am I insane? This game asks the real important questions about life. My mind is still processing what the ???? just happened. Good game, i think.  It's a Unity game, so low spec computer users, use caution before buying. Not sure if a smooth experience awaits. Didn't try on my laptop sporting a GeForce 610M. My other computer has a GeForce GTX 1050, and 60FPS throughout.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/wildgoosespeeder/recommended/499520,1, The puzzles and atmosphere are amazing. It's a philosophy game, just like The Talos Principle. However, as the story progressed very early on, I had a gut feeling who the antagonist was going to be, and I was right. This could be because I have played many first person puzzler games before and just kind of know what to expect. However, the ending felt like a twist to me. I never expected  T.O.M. to be in control of Ava Turing (protagonist and player character) the entire time, and it creeped me out pretty good.   Because of that, I can see why the game is called The Turing Test. It's a real world concept, adapted around to be a game. I got some decent exposure to the concept. Now I am interested outside the game.  This game marks a turning point for me. I am doing away with compromising graphic fidelity for an increased framerate. This game is amazing and worth the wait for me getting a new graphics card to be able to play this without compromising anything. I would highly recommend the game if you are ready for games requiring high graphical horsepower. The graphics card I selected was entry level; the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050. This will hold me over and for future games I was looking to play in my wishlist, but never was confident enough my old configuration could handle it. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049837486/recommended/40700,1, To improve on perfection  Oooooooooooooooonly ever use the solution book if you are stuck, otherwise you  will miss out.  I don't know when this game got an update but it refined some things. The soundtrack has been elongated in some parts, improving it. Pretty insane to improve on something so great. UI improvement, the mouse cursor fits the theme. Stories pop up when idle. RMB zoom. Robot &quot;up-down-movement&quot; has been simplified - I like it.  I have 57 steam friends, but only 4 of those have this game. The rest you are a bunch of uncultered swine.  Machinarium with Escape from Monkey Island are my two favorite puzzle games.  -Review is still being written but im playing atm, just collecting ideas.-  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/wildgoosespeeder/recommended/904780,-1, The controls are crippling. This game requires a bit of precision but I found out that no air straifing exists. This makes platforming frustrating. Also, no way to remap buttons. I use an XInput controller (XBox 360 or Xbox One controller) and I find it hard on the fingers to run by holding a shoulder button. It should be one of the trigger buttons or like old school Mario games like Super Mario World. That would pair up nicely with the jump button.  Head bobbing can be nauseating for those prone to motion sickness (I'm not but I can see it happening). There should be a way to turn that off.  I skipped the opening cinematic and no way to make it reappear.  Unreal Engine 4 game. Smooth on a GeForce GTX 1050.  Music has a nod to  Eye of the Tiger  reference, which is cliche in not just games, but movies and TV too.  Couldn't stand this game for more than 20 minutes. Refunded.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kraz3/recommended/322500,1, Fantastic game. Aesthetically pleasing with an interesting and kinda freaky story. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kraz3/recommended/275850,1, I've spent 4.5 hours straight in this game since I got home from work. I love it. It is very simple and doesn't have a TON of depth yet. But there is something about the scale and loneliness that immerses me like few other games have. I spent a majority of my play time just flying my ship around my starting world from outpost to outpost exploring and spent 20 minutes happily lost in a cave system, before jet packing out of a ravine that happily came out on the backside of a hill overlooking my crashed ship. Discovering new creatures is also a treat XD. I found some really cute little dog thingys and some bigger fish cows among others. Check my profile for screenshots. The promised features coming in future updates really have me excited to see where this game is headed.  There are a couple cons however. I do wish I had more control over my ship when I was flying in atmosphere. I also wish there was a map feature (that really anybody with access to tech this advanced would logically have) that would log previously seen and visited locations along a planets surface. There are also some performance issues however I don't think these will be a problem for long. The game does not like alt-tabbing. I haven't had it crash on me yet, but lots of other people are reporting crashing before even being able to play.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198190122945/recommended/440,1, This game is really fun, most of it because of the mods.

Ran 60FPS on max settings on my GeForce GTX 1050. Do not recommend for budget graphics cards though for this Unreal Engine 4 game. Getting the optional collectables can be a timing and trajectory challenge.  One thing that could use improvement is telegraphing that you can charge shots for throwing the ball. I was getting frustrated around the 10th level in. I accidentally discovered charging up shots.  Great game overall!

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049837486/recommended/234140,1, Negatives: This game has some silly bugs. I would really appreciate if they would fix them.  Examples: Sound only plays voice. No ambient, no music, no vehicle sounds. UI does not display messages, but it still collects them until some event clears the blockage and you get 500 messages. Which is nice.  The list continues: - permanent fire bug - wrong map symbol (rare)  Positives:  Australia  is a wild place mate. I can hear the thunder.  Only game I know that takes place in Australia. And I imagine it to be this hellish wasteland where everyone wants and can kill you.  I am really impressed by the clean design choice to associate the colour red with non-counterable. If you see red-flash it's a sniper, you can't block his bullet. If you see a red symbol above a combatant you know he will charge you, you can't block his charge. Well done.  Also this game is a man-simulator. You hunt, you gather, you become the alpha male. Very attractive. I am atracted to men it's so confusing. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kraz3/recommended/4000,1, Prop Hunt. Enough said. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073297551/recommended/365590,-1,  Short Version   positive points:     the graphic engines does a good job (if you meet the system requirements)    the intro movie was quite interesting    negative points:     just a generic shooter    no variation in enemies, locations, quests, To-Do's,     balance between the verious kinds of weapons is kinda bad    pvp is just bad    the loot pool is imo too small for a loot driven MMO    cosmetic items looks almost the same    gear except of weapons dont show up on your char     char creation too boring for 2016    game is too expensive for this content which currently holds    meta classes like tank are in most casses pretty much useless.    no real gold sink for normal credits after reaching lvl 30    fast travel takes a long time to load    no possibility to travel faster through the streets instead of running (car, bike whatever)    Long Version The game could be basically a nice loot driven shooter but not at the current state. And besides the good looking graphic engine there is nothing which is up to date.  Every char you play/meet in the division world looks mostly the same. The same with locations, enemies, cosmetic items, and so on. For the locations, you may have the rebuild of the RL NYC but after some while every street, every ingame location looks just like the same.   The enemies may differ from each other but there are too less variation. You have one with a hoodie, one with a armor, one with a flame thrower, one tanky like and one which looks like a medic. You will see all these stated kinds from lvl 1 to lvl 30 and so one. Even bosses looks like normal enemies just they have a fancy name and a huge health pool.  The same goes for the loot pool in this game. You have 5 or 6 kinds of different weapon categories and in each maybe 5-6 different types. Thats it.  Cosmetic items which you can find ingame mostly just differ in a color. Other kinds of costumization don't exist either. Gear don't show up on your ingame model, and the char creation is even worse than fallout 3 creation system.  As for the skill system, you can spec in all kinds of builds (heal/support, tank, DD, sniper, ..) but things like aggro increse system is just useful in a group of random not very good equipped players. Moreover, most players playing with SMG or Asault rifle and melting everything.   At the moment, I am just disappointed that I invested 60¢ã in a MMO game which keeps me interested for around 70h, which is kinda sad.

The emotions the character shown felt real and genuine, the character's interactions felt &quot;human&quot;, and the ending was heartbreaking, seeing a character sacrificing themeselves for the main character after all they have done together.   In the end I would recomend you playing this wonderfully crafted game.  Come to think of it... it's similar to &quot;Detroit Become Human&quot;.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/4453776/recommended/420530,1, This game is almost revolutionary in way. It's true breaking the fourth wall isn't something new but this game takes it to a whole perspective, the game knows and recognizes you exist. The interesting thing about that is the game talks you in ways many other games similar cant do, like undertale. Undertale becomes really bland after playing this game especially how this game handles it's gameplay. Undertale is just another rpg with simple endings. This game has rich characters even though they might look bland a first glance but once you gone through the game multiple times you start to see what the characters are really like. Right now to be honest writing review this in-depth to show my love for this and it's wonderful community it gathered, is really hard because I can't just spoil the game in this. I want you to have a chance to experience it and see for yourself. Like I said earlier it's revolutionary game that changes people's opinion of how the fourth wall should be use instead of talking a little bit the player.  Just play the game and enjoy.   Hey, I'm not saying that undertale is bad, I never found it to be immerising to the player.  It's not a one size fit all, so if you don't like it's your fault because  1. you're closed minded, 2. you've never played these type of games, 3. You're from a toxic community,  or 4. Your standards are to high for a simple game. ;3

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dalliss/recommended/304930,1, Been playing this since its first version came out.I really like the way it improves with every update.It is allready really good and it is becoming more and more great.Playing with friends on a local server spawning anything doing crazy stuff , arena or w/e is really fun. Being alone in a single player survival still seems awesome, but multiplayer is just not really good.Every server has too many kids screaming and actually not even saying anything +its super hard for someone who went into a server for the first time to actually get anything, he will die to anything,basically multiplayer has servers and in each one of those there is only 1-4 OP players who have everything and others are struggling to find a simple knife.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Eldum/recommended/696790,1, So I love every COD game I have played. What I have to say about the beta:  Ignore the negative reviews. If you get an &quot;update error&quot; the way I fixed it was restarting the game and letting it go through the opening sequence and it will download the update. My internet isn't very good and this game runs very well on it (I do lag sometimes). Other than that, I have run into no problems.  Am I buying this game? Definitely. I don't mind that it has the same gameplay template as the other games. If you like Call of Duty, I have three words for you.  PLAY. THE. BETA. I haven't regretted it.  I love it. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Eldum/recommended/766370,1, So as someone who thoroughly enjoyed Dying Light, I have been looking forward to this. Note: Early Access means that it is not the final product, so yes it will have bugs. I have run into plenty, but as I have stated 0.5 seconds ago, this game is still currently being worked on, so I am not at all worried about it in this current place in time.  So anyways, to sum up this game, Playing Early Access is worth the $20. But forewarning, as soon as you play a few matches, you might not want to stop playing.  Game on!!!

It sets itself apart enough to not be a generic survival game. If you absolutely hate survival games give it a pass. This probably won't change your mind.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ki11sone/recommended/973760,1, The game is great. Could do without the card based challenges and gameplay, but it's easy enough that I can look past it. It's really great to get another story in the Witcher universe. Also look at that art style it's gorgeous. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ki11sone/recommended/306130,1, Very good MMO and an Elder Scrolls game. Both for groups of friends and Solo players. Plenty of story even before all the DLC and no subscription fee to play after initial purchase which is a huge plus. There is a subscription, but it is in no way a requirement and you don't need it to play the full game, but it does give you 1500 crowns which is $15 worth of in game currency and you get access to all the DLC you don't already own.   
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ki11sone/recommended/758080,1, Game has a lot of potential. Definitely something to keep an eye on.  As of right now the game plays pretty well. I think the only gripes I have with it are mainly the camera and combat which seems a little janky, but can easily be tweaked if the Dev so chooses. The issue I have is the fog of war while in dungeons and not really having a sense of direction on where to go. I think you should be able to see a lot further in the dungeons and just having a better guide on exactly you should be doing.  Besides those the game runs fine and the graphics aren't all that bad for someone doing it themselves.  Keep an eye on this one, definitely worth a pick especially if you're waiting for it to leave EA. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/valletpeter/recommended/203770,1, Great base game, i dont know about DLC but $200 seems a bit excessive in my expert opinion 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/luxsilvestra/recommended/292030,1, After almost 4 years, this is still my favourite game and I can't praise it enough. The best. Forever and always.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198142812167/recommended/287390,1, Hi! I strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes horror and story games. I finished it twice, once to get the bad ending and once to get the good one and I can not say i got bored when playing it for the second time, I even liked it more. It's story is tremendous. It is a masterpiece! Theese two games, Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light are a must play! I am so happy that Metro Exodus is going to be released this year! :) XD 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198142812167/recommended/57300,1, After so many years still one of the best horror game 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198297289863/recommended/230410,1, ok so i just started this game yesterday and this already looks like destiny which means i love this game! 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198142812167/recommended/433850,1, Hi! I am gonna start this review saying that it is a really nice and fun game.  &quot;+&quot;: +The graphics are very good +The gameplay is also another plus +It is free :))))   &quot;-&quot;: -This game has only one map -The loot is the same and it is too frequently. For example, there are 7 types of weapons, if i am not wrong and in a house you find at least 2 or even 3 weapons...   Overall it is a great game but it needs to beworked on a little more. I hope, since the game is free now and a lot of new people will play it, that in the near future there will be some updates. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198297289863/recommended/204360,1, Good game, it¡¯s fun to play with other people but most of the time playing alone gives you more XP. I highly recommend this game! 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198142812167/recommended/381210,1, Best game ever 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198142812167/recommended/578080,1, Very noice! Yes it has bugs but the bugs make the game funnier. Yes it has cheaters but what game doesn't? Overall it's still the best battle royale game and will be for a long time. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ki11sone/recommended/488790,1, This game is amazing. I absolutely love it. I didn't care for the first game all that much because it was too slow, but despite that I finished it and enjoyed the story. This game however is leagues better than the first game and it fixes pretty much every issue I had with the first game. If you love South Park or even remotely liked the first game then you will greatly enjoy the Fractured But Whole.  Despite what others say. You can play the game and unlock Steam Achievements just fine, even with Uplay in the background. It is even nice as well as Uplay gives you free items and lets you earn points through achievements to unlock the Assassins Creed outfit. It's no big thing as the costumes in this game don't count towards abilities or stats like the first game did so you can make you character look as cool as you want and the Assassins Creed Outfit is indeed cool.  As for the Day One DLC it is just outfits from the first game as a throwback. It should have at least been Pre-Order DLC and then purchasable afterward or at least given to those who own the first game, but it is what it is. They are just costumes and that is it. They don't change gameplay or give any perks for wearing them. The fact people are down voting the game based on that just shows how pity and childish they are. Getting mad over a costume instead of focusing on the gameplay.  Despite all that I hope you give the game a chance. It is amazingly fun and one I plan on beating (Which is rare for me) and I am even thinking about picking up the Season Pass just because I want to play the Story DLC that they will eventually release. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/valletpeter/recommended/245470,-1, Its a bit outdated and has a lot of wierd design choices. It really doesn't have replayablity. The DLCs should have been base game. It really needed a floating population. All the countries are out of date and it doesn't depict America in any realistic fashion, but as a European Socialist model.  Catagories aree a bit off, and populations can only be a single voting group rather than a complex mixture of independent ideas.   Every Religious Person votes one way; Every Conservative is one way, Every Liberal is one way. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ki11sone/recommended/235800,-1, Game is fun, but without streaming I can't recommend it at $15. Grab it while it's on sale for a couple dollars, but only if you have a huge folder of songs downloaded onto your computer to play.  Dev has to realise that this isn't 2005 anymore. People don't download thousands of songs anymore. Even when we buy are music digitally now we don't download them. We STREAM them. Which by the way you can't even stream your owned music anymore either. You literally have to go through and spend hours and download all of your song onto your computer. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Emza998/recommended/381210,1, Awesome game but awful matchmaking - should be renamed lobby simulator tho you could say im ''hooked'' on it :P  this is the buggiest game of the century, dont buy it full price tho, wait for sale 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Eldum/recommended/447040,1, GTA V: **** the Police Watch Dogs 2: Troll the Police  Recommended? YES!  PS: Right now in the month of August, it has been crashing, but it might just be me. All in all, it's worth it.  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ki11sone/recommended/644930,-1, Great Idea. Poorly implemented. Game requires more luck than skill. I see people say that it took them 30+ hours to beat the first map and praising the game. The game doesn't require praise it requires change. There is something fundamentally wrong with your game if it takes most players 30+ hours to beat the first map.  The game is worth to keep an eye on, but don't buy right now because the game is completely unbalanced and for devs that are constantly updating the game they aren't focusing on fixing the main issues right now.  This review is also from pretty early in the Early Access release. Hopefully the devs fix the issues close to release and the game will be worth a pick up. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ki11sone/recommended/589360,-1, Game is very beautiful. Unfortunately that doesn't save the game. I've played 6 hours as of writing this and the game is not well optimised. Very choppy even on low settings and high end computers. Even if you were able to get past that the game is extremely easy with no way to make it harder and the story just falls really short of what eveyone was expecting. Especially with how good the first game was.  This feels more like a spinoff rather than a true sequel. It is not worth $60. Maybe $40 max, I am sad that I regret buying the game and that I can't get a refund because I truly wanted to love this game like I did the first. Guess that teaches me not to give in to a game because I liked the original.  Might still finish the game if the Devs ever decide to fix the performance issues.  Don't spend $60 on it. Wait for a sale and try to get it cheaper if you are really wanting to play it. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ki11sone/recommended/613830,-1, I am only saying no on recommending it because of the ports many many flaws. Chrono Trigger is an amazing game, but with so many flaws I'm voting no it hopes that Square will fix it or at the very least stop giving us the horrible mobile ports.  Here's a list of Stuff they need to fix. - Graphics filter makes this beautiful game just look bad. - Tiles in the overmap need to realligned correctly. The fact that you can see the individual squares is just unacceptable. - In-game overlay and HUD needs to be revamped. It is literally the ios overlay. Needs to be updated to suit the PC. - The overlay and HUD need to show PC buttons and not Controller buttons in the menu. I don't even have a controller for my PC. - Needs to have actual Graphics Options instead of just the resolution. - The game needs to have some serious optimization. There is no reason for this old of a game to have hiccups and FPS drops. Especially since it's an ios port. - Sprite Filtering needs to have an option to be turned off. - Fix the Wait option for battles. The Wait option literally says &quot;Take your time to choose items and fight strategically&quot; you cannot do this because despite the Wait option being marked the monsters constantly attack.  and for the love of god please give us back the original sprites.  Chrono Trigger is one of my most favorite games. I am very sad it was treated like this. If they do fix the game I would happily change this to a million times recommend. Even in the state that it's in I would have to say pick it up and enjoy the story and extra dungeons they added into it.  If you can get past the issues I mentioned you will not regret playing this amazing game.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/mewberi/recommended/215280,-1, I loved the original secret world, the lore is immersive and many of the puzzles were fun to work through coupled with the lore it made for a great experience!  Despite the reboot, i was excited for legends as i thought what we would be getting was an updated version of the game coupled with improved cosmetics and an improved battle system as we were promised, what we actually got was a somehow even worse battle system with less customizability and impressively even more stripped down character customization.  Content updates have even in comparison managed to have been stripped down, many missions from the original were removed needlessly leaving a void in place of it and the new crafting system is designed with making money in mind so on no account can i recommend this version of the game. it's a shame that the charms that made me fall in love with the original are almost gone or overshadowed here, i want to love this version as i had the original but that's impossible in its current state...  This isn't the secret world.  This is the legend of how much can funcom disrespect longtime fans and strip down a once well loved game, Maybe someday they'll change their ways but until that day comes i cannot and will not recommend it to anyone.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/mewberi/recommended/459540,1, If there's one thing i could say about the game it's that this would undoubtedly be perfect for the iOS as it works wonderfully as a time killing card battle game and i could see many other's being able to get into it even more strongly on that platform. While the tutorial doesn't do well to explain the mechanics of the game very clearly i was able to easily figure my way around having played many card games of a similar nature in the past so found myself able to soar through my playthrough with fair ease on normal mode and overall found this one quite enjoyable!  One of my favourite features was getting to talk to the girl's and getting to know them individually, over the course of the game you can unlock 'topics' and interact with them during certain periods using 10 AP, When exiting the game there seems to be special skits where you can see some of the girls from other teams or otherwise interacting or in some cases saying an ending message by their lonesome as was the case of a certain heroine.  Other than that it turns out my new kitten really loves this game and puts her paws up on the side of my laptop to watch which is just too precious~ The ost is wonderful and the work the artists did on all the available characters is something to really be admired.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/mewberi/recommended/253230,1, An absolutely adorable and charming collectathon platformer that brings the heart of the classics, the controls are tight and it comes with controller support! i've followed the development of this game for a long time (i believe it was 2014) and i can happily say i am not in the slightest disappointed.  The level design is incredibly detailed with a lovely ost to accompany it and plenty you can interact with and rewards you for taking the time to explore in fact, the moment i thought to continue on back to the main story i found myself tempted back into doing so almost instantly when i saw something nearby that raised my curiousity!   As you go along you'll start to collect hats which will have different abilities and you can quickly switch between at the drop of a hat as well as badges which will appear on them, granting you special abilities as well. you earn the hats by collecting yarn and can purchase the badges from a mysterious merchant who hangs around the levels and the orbs you collect and can find scattered everywhere are the currency that is used.  More content will be on the horizon and with a workshop you're sure to be able to find new things to enjoy with this game, i couldnt recommend it strongly enough! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/mewberi/recommended/460160,1, Incredibly short kinetic side-story novel for anyone who's a fan of the grisaia series. worth a fun laugh if you're wanting to see the main cast again, wouldnt recommend playing this before the main game or expecting this to be your main draw into  the series since this is more of a comedic slice-of-life intended for fans and the shortness of it may leave you feeling unsatisfied. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968819806/recommended/377160,1, Fallout 4 is a solid choice. Whether you like adventure, combat, specs and skilling or chasing tail this game has something for everyone. The sandbox style play encourages you to follow the path less traveled and the replay value is out of this world. If you only play one game this period-following-centuries-of-nuclear-winter, consider making it this one. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/keimonowO/recommended/239800,1, I remember having this game from a steam reduction earned while crafting a badge, so I gave it a go ! I was nicely surprised, as simple to handle but challenging to master, this is all-in-all a great game in a retro-pixel style. The story is not that long but for completionist this and the arcade mode will take you time to master ;)   So to resume buy it it's worth the price and enjoy it because it's a great game of it's kind =) 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/mewberi/recommended/329490,1, A nice beat'em up that's nice and easy to just pick up, coupled with endearing graphics and music to tie it all together,if you're a big fan of the genre then this is another welcome addition to the genre. The combo system is satisfying and co-op is a blast as it should be.  On the downside i personally was not a fan of the PC controls and would highly recommend using a controller if you do play this, the game works absolutely perfectly with a ps4 and switch pro controller and feels smooth showing how it was designed with controllers in mind as opposed to a keyboard which is unfortunate, you cannot rebind the awful keyboard controls either so its non-adjustable.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968819806/recommended/250600,1, In ¡®The Plan¡¯ you assume the role of a monstrous beast with six pneumatic limbs, sophisticated flight abilities and the most highly-developed sense of vision of any creature on your planet. Having started life as a lowly maggot you must now spread your wings and embark on the journey of a lifetime. The world will relentlessly throw obstacles in your path as you exhaust every manoeuvre, and persevere using every fibre of your being to realise your destiny in an epic quest that will test your resolve to the very end. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/mewberi/recommended/413150,1, An absolutely darling farming game in the same vein as harvest moon/story of seasons, yet not purely defined by it's forefathers becoming the perfect successor to them. Stardew valley is more than worth it's price tag and brings a lot to the table for the genre impressively more so by the fact that it was created by one person and that heart truly manages to shine through with frequent updates.  If you liked harvest moon then you absolutely owe it to yourself to give this game a shot as you most definitely will not be disappointed. Everything from the music to the graphics, gameplay and characters oozes charm and is polished to a point of being noteworthy with small attention to details that you have to really hand it to the developer. it is now honestly a true classic and no doubt will be remembered fondly by many and with good reason.  The character's that reside within the world are all unique and well-written, each having more going on underneath the surface than first impressions imply and having their own lives to live that it felt nice just being able to get to know them all, even characters i initially thought i wasn't going to like turned out to be so much better once past the first initial impressions.   Each pursuit is satisfying as well, farming, working on your home and either helping save the town or supporting the supermarket overlord of course works exceptionally well from what you'd expect, that it's even a choice on the table being nice to see and both options have a noticeable affect on the town itself. Yet it doesn't end there, you have fish to catch, a mine with monsters to explore with more only unlocked after you complete exploring it, a museum to help complete, marriage that isn't restrictive based on your gender preferences, With many secrets to discover even after heavily exploring the content the game has to offer. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968819806/recommended/346250,1, A fun little point-and-click puzzler in which you play as a granny smith apple/octopus hybrid, The Old Tree has a short, simple playstyle to suit casual gamers that do not want to lose their hair over obscure challenges.  The game has dark, moody visuals, so is best to avoid playing on a sunny morning with a dusty monitor. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ghostnight/recommended/341940,1, Cute game   ( ?¡ã ?? ?¡ã) 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ghostnight/recommended/383870,1, Amazing game, the voice acting is really well made. It makes you want more and more. The artwork, well, the artwork is stunning, really well done. You can lost tons of time just looking around. The story is really interesting, it focus on some delicate themes and can get you hooked till the end.  The only downside, is the time of the gameplay, I wanted more and more. So yeah, I would love to see more from firewatch in the future.  Also, the soundtrack is really well made. From the artwork to the soundtrack, this game is an outstanding piece of art.  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ghostnight/recommended/374570,1, My thoughts when i saw this on steam &quot;let's just see how it is&quot;   30 minutes later, f0cking awesome 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ABCali/recommended/311870,-1, Don't waste your time here. It's enjoyable but other than that there is nothing this game can present anything to you. Humor is just so much excess that you give up caring about it. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ABCali/recommended/294100,1, Hopefully will get to write something here soon. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ABCali/recommended/709450,1, Really loved this prequel. It's full of lore, excitement, questions, thrill and suspense. Quite unexpecting for a 2d adventure game. I will try the next game whenever possible. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ghostnight/recommended/322330,1, Awesome, and the best survival game.  You will find one great community, that will help you understand and how to get better in the game. One awesome workshop with tons of mods that will improve your gameplay and make different every time you play the game, if you want it  ofc.  The game itself have a great artwork, with a good soundtrack and the devs make constants updates.  So, if you are looking for a game to spend a good time, this is the one for you, but be aware, you will starve a lot, but at least you will not starve alone.   10/10, buy it :D 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ABCali/recommended/274190,1, Amazing Stuff! And if you are fan 80-90's action movies, just double the joy. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ghostnight/recommended/429570,1, So far it's really good, if you liked the previous WD games you will definitely love this. If not, you will have one great experience.   Graphically is the same type of graphics that telltale have us used, the gameplay is really well optimized, better than the previous telltale games. It runs really smooth.  The soundtrack is pretty good too.  The game itself is amazing, great story with nice details, and you don't need to watch the tv series, or read the BD to enjoy the game, if you like this type of game you will like it.  But take in mind that it's a game that comes out by episodes, and the episodes will take 1.5/2 h to finish, depend  what you do at your gameplay.   So far it's really worth the price, it's a game that you can pre order if you trust telltale, or buy after you saw the reviews and you will not need to send 60 ¢ã to enjoy it when it comes out, and you probably will enjoy it more than other games.   I trully recommend it 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/mewberi/recommended/815770,1, For anyone who's having trouble viewing everything in this dlc go into properties, local files, then click browse local files and everything will be in the folder titled 'BBTAG Early Purchase Bonus'  the art book is contained within two PDFs, along with the mp3s and some wallpapers, i'd rate it a 5/10, the art book is mostly just some rough drafts of the sprites and the smallest handful of them possible which is a shame, i would have liked to see a little more of just about anything, so if you wanted to early purchase just for it or in the future buy this i'd take that into account and say &quot;its not really worth it as far as art book is concerned&quot;   however the mp3s are of a good quality so worthwhile if you wanted any of the songs listed! as i recieved this free with the game i'll give it a thumbs up since with that in mind it's inoffensive. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ABCali/recommended/3800,-1, Advent Rising houses &quot;great feature&quot;-to-be elements, however most of them does stay not fleshed out or straight bad in execution.  One of them is story. Orson Scott Card which is one of my favourite author in SF (writer of Ender's Game and Speaker of the Dead which is amongst my favourite SF list) did a quite well job however without the sequels, story stands there as another cliche title.  Gameplay is the worst part of the game, I think. From the gunplay point of view, it really fails to structure a good shoot and hit formula. There is no feeling in any of the guns' usage. Aiming is simplified but doesn't get to a more qualified level. It is kind of auto aim or you select your target and shoot to him. At some battles this renders some problems, with you not aiming wherever you want and in a TPS title (which would have been a blockbuster, it was to be a quasi rival of halo-unreal-quake type&quot; games.  From the point of view of powers, it is a lot enjoyable. I mean once you get them, you will probably do not use any other guns in campaign. But the thing is, it is like you are playing jedi academy which has done this part already a lot lot better.  Sound and music are okay. Music kind of get a bit repetitive by the end where in every cinematic it plays the same dramatical music again and again and again.  Developers designed this franchise as a trilogy so it carries a movie vibe in it. Therefore, you can find a lot of cinematics here. However, some cinematics are not related or I couldn't form a relation with the level they are proceeded with. You sometimes teleport to somewhere where the previous cinematic doesn't end. It's quite a drawback for a game tries to be like a novel.  and at last, bugs. They are everywhere and these are not Heinlein's Startship Trooper's bugs, I can assure you. I just can't imagine how a triple AAA title be just like this clunky, bugged, sterotypical etc.   Btw, are these people living in a low gravity environment? How can they possess such long legs, pretty weird skeleton structure? hmppf, I guess they left a lot of questions open to us, right? 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ghostnight/recommended/413150,1, One of the best farm simulators, the simplicity of the visuals of this game is awesome. It makes the playthrough so smooth. This is the type of game that you want to play just do decompress.   On top of that, the content of the game is great, you can put a lot of hours into the game, there's a lot to do, and a lot to discover. You will need to interact a lot with the npc's to get the max out the game.  The soundtrack is plus, it's great, really well done and suits like a charm with the game.  And now you can also enjoy all this other people with the co-op option. If you like co-op games , this one is really well done and makes the game even more fun. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ABCali/recommended/12640,1, Low-Budget Dragon Age: Origins-like RPG. Hard at some points but once you feel like you are doing a little bit well, it will become a hell of ride.  And For Role play purposes, it is among the best ones.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/ghostnight/recommended/314410,1, One of the best beat'em up co-op games I have ever played.  The game has tons of achievements and 4 difficult modes that can put a bunch of extra hours of gameplay.  You will go through a lot of dungeons, and for every time you  play the game those dungeons will change. The loot will change, like the enemies. With this, every time you  play the game it will feel different.  There's also various types of modes that you can try, so you don't need to be always playing the same mode.  It's totally worth to get this game.  10/10

So I left half of the farm as wilderness, because I couldn't break her heart like that.  It must have worked, because a couple years later we got married.  10/10 best alternative life.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041760692/recommended/433340,1, Slime Rancher is a delightfuly cute game, but there's also a strange lonliness that pervades it.    The slimes themselves are adorable and surprisingly full of personality, ranging from huggable to terrifying.  At the same time, the lack of NPCs in the game adds a certain melancholy that's only heightened by the letters from home that the protagonist recieves.  Nothing cheers you up like kitty-slimes though.  &lt;3 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ABCali/recommended/6920,-1, This game could have been one of the different RPGs in the market but the worst hindarence  is the engine. I mean if you are using a modern system you have to do some external work to get the game work. I wrote what I have done to forums; you can find there. Aside from it, the engine loads itself too much that after a while I have to get my pc sleep for it to work fluently(which I found this solution randomly) or else it will lag huge and loading times takes a lot longer.    Apart from these issues, I think the story is cool with a lot of conspiracies just like you can find in any other Deus Ex game.  I really mean it. What lacks here is; you have got pretty lots of solutions and consequences for the quests however the consequences only affects the level you are on. To explain it more, If you choose a faction and betray another, the next level you can ally with the one you betray; they just believe that you are the &quot;One&quot; so can easily forgive you what you have done. It's pretty awkward if you think that how detailed this quest system compared to other RP games out there.  Combat and skill systems are pretty simplified but it does not matter to me. I could just focus on story elements more thanks to these.   So would I recommend you this game? I'd rather not. If you are not a Deus Ex fan, skip this game. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Crazyfaith/recommended/601980,-1, Another cash grab by ?????? devs. Where should I start? -gameplay is NOTHING like the picture shows -you can't see the controls so when you actually have to play you have no idea what to press since the ?????? camera -made by unity so yeah, you guess it right so the dev doesn't even have to put time and effort to make games on steam -the reviews that put positive to this game are just ???????? (IMO anyway) since the only reason that most of them give is that yeah it has boobs physics, if that is your thing just go buy a sakura game or something else 'cuz trust me this isn't not worth even a penny 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ABCali/recommended/258180,1, I don't know what other people were expecting in the end but it is a good small/simplified game that is converted from mobile origin. It is Deus Ex to the end of its roots. Only downsides of it  is having some little bugs and unfinished storyline(probably won't be done after Mankind Divided's financial failure). But if you ignore these parts, it is Deus Ex to its core. You can find a lot different solutions for the quests which you can't find in most of the RPG titles out there. It's highly enjoyable and for me, it is meant to be played in a stealthy way. It just lasted 5 hour or so.   Really, grab this when it is on sale if you are DX fan.   I'll be playing DX: IW after this. That game also is ba*tardized by DX community due to its simplification and engine problems. Probably that game will turn out to be a good DX game also.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Crazyfaith/recommended/640150,1, WoW killer, it even has a queue just like it when they release an expansion. But really I barely played like a half of an hour in the test server and it seems really promising.  okay 10 likes, I should probably be more self-explanatory after 10 hours, you don't have anything to play? do you miss the old school games like RS? You now have found your hidden gem, this game maybe looks plain and simple for some people but I really enjoy it that old feeling of progressing and grindring through games, 2 persons made this game and they are really responsive in discord for whatever issue you are having (first few days into EA, it sounds trite but yes the servers are going through a hard time since a lot of people are trying to play it, why? because there isn't any game that are appealing to them) it doesn't have loot boxes or any of this new generation of games (you can support the 2 devs paying monthly in patreon or buying skins ingame, not even P2W like a lot of games) so yes, if you are boring and you have nothing to try and you want to remember back the good old days just try it since is free and fresh, and if you can try to support these 2 amazing devs. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Crazyfaith/recommended/619080,-1, Okay what we can say about this beautiful game that one time was. It had originality, you could team up and maybe that one person ended up betraying you lots of things could happen that randomness of not knowing what was going to happen, the cannibals and everything all truly original. But then what changed? The devs panicked since they were losing their playerbase so they question themselves what they should do and did the same as fornite did, since it was dying they made the decision of making a BR. From a completely original idea to the mediocre BR that is now, and what is even funny is when you give them a constructive critique they choose to delete it.   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1424882683   And I'm really sorry for all the people that believe and supported the devs but that is the risk of EA games, but I strongly believe if you manage to do something like when the??????of NMS happened there is a very small chance to get a refund for the money that you spend on this, that clearly has become in something that you didn't expect 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Crazyfaith/recommended/706220,-1, really? we can't even choose to play in the server that we want? ofc and like the devs are great the achievs and everything is bugged in SA since there is no support, nice!

This is the kind of game I don't play consistently. It's very calming and relaxing so it's mostly a stress relief game for me. I 100% this game and about halfway through year 2 most people get a little bored. When multiplayer was released I came back to the game because it really is fun with friends.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/CriticallyM/recommended/413150,1, Romanticizing Pastoral Life ¡ª Stardew Valley starts with a relatively cut and dry plot that throws you in the middle of an inherited farm. The basic loop of the game starts out with you cleaning up the farm, planting crops and trying to figure out what the town is about. That in itself was enough and hit home for me personally, as I too am privy to the ideals of escapism to get away and live off the 'fat of the land'. The game so far feels like a simple game about farming but soon adds another layer ¡ª keeping up friendships and trying to fix up the town to its past glory. But it doesn't stop there it keeps going with each passing season things change peoples personalities evolve and open up along the way.   You find a mine, you discover fishing ¡ª all of which are repetitive mundane tasks to say the least but this game's sleep and seasonal cycle doesn't let you dwell on one thing for too long and nudges you towards improvement. But of-course you have choice ¡ª you can attend that festival or let it go, keep farming, fishing or mining everyday or potentially have a more balanced experience. The game very rarely forces your hand into doing something rather it nudges and suggests.   I'm still working my way through the game but, if you want to decompress and chill out, give it a try, you will know within a loop of a day or two, if this is your cup of tea or not. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/oen386/recommended/362350,1, Good game, but a bad port. If you want a number score, I would say 3/5.  First, I've played Boss Monster a few times before this electronic version showed up on Kickstarter. I do not own the mobile version.  Let me start by saying I own a Surface Pro 3, a Windows 8.1 tablet. I thought having a digital copy of this would make it fun to play on the go. The problem is the port has some critical bugs they need to fix. Story time...  The major game bug I had is with touch devices, after a while the game loses focus. When you're tapping the screen you're actually clicking behind the game window. When you finally Alt+Tab to the desktop you'll see all these programs open because you've been clicking your shortcuts and items on your desktop. This bug is terrible, and would happen every 3-5 minutes without fail, when not using a mouse. I would have to hit the Windows button a few times to bring up the start menu, then click the program in the task bar, or I would have to hook up a keyboard and forgo the ease of using the Surface as a tablet to recover the game.  This bug seemed to happen in fullscreen, so then I thought &quot;I'll just play in Window mode&quot;. Surprise! Here is the first clue this is a cheap port of the mobile version. You get 4 options in the Settings menu. Music volume, sound effect volume, game speed, and fullscreen on/off. &quot;Okay, no real graphic settings, but at least I can make it Windowed&quot; I thought. This brings me to the next major bug. If you have a high resolution screen, like on a Surface Pro 3, the game window is tiny, card text is unreadable. Then you discover you can't resize the window, or make the window take up the full screen. You have two options, tiny unreadable window, or fullscreen. :(  Fine fine... I loaded the game up on my main desktop PC and figured with it's lower resolution screen at least it would be readable in Window mode, and it was! I then figured, &quot;Alright let me play a few games!&quot; That is where I ran into the next issue, again because it is a poor port. This game has minimal Steam features, which tends to be the trend with mobile ports. This means there is no Cloud Saves. To unlock extra Heroes, which is DLC I own, I have to win 40 games... that means I have to win 40 games on each device I own because the save game isn't transferred between my devices or carried over after I reformat. :(  Lastly, some game design choices are weird. When using a touch devices you have to double tap everything to activate, when using a mouse it is a single click. Also the Halt button seems like a waste. There is no reason for the Halt button. The game should show you the 3 buttons, Pass All, Go (Pass Once), and Play Card. If you choose Play Card, then it should pause/halt. There is no reason to have to open a menu 95% of the time just to get to &quot;Pass All&quot;. It seems very unnecessary, except as an attempt to save visual space on a mobile device.  Now. Why the thumbs up? It's a fun game, and I hope they fix these issues, it was just released and I trust they'll look into it. Though even things like the &quot;In-App Store&quot; just scream it's a very weak mobile port. I figure once they iron out these bugs with touch devices, and maybe add some graphic settings (at least resolution options or scaling) the game will be perfect for a quick purchase and play on a trip.  Pros: * The pixel graphics are nice. * The music is nice. * Faithful to the card game.  Cons: * No Steam support (other than trading cards), which means you're save isn't transferred between devices. * No graphics options * Poor touch screen/device support  To make this game 5/5, it would have been awesome to have Steam Workshop support, allow people to make custom cards, or at least add new images to existing cards. I feel Steam features, and mods/customizing is locked out to keep the PC/mobile ports the same, and to sell DLC unfortunately. One can dream though...

https://steamcommunity.com/id/oen386/recommended/107410,1, For an alpha it is great! Can't wait for beta in a couple of weeks, and then the full release later. There are some performance bugs, but the freedom in multiplayer is unmatched. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/oen386/recommended/113020,1, This has to be the cooperative game of the year. I haven't had a bad game yet joining random people online. Super easy for people to play, but still challenging try to meet all the objectives.  I recommend it for anyone looking for a 4 player game to play. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/oen386/recommended/107100,1, Great game. As anyone will tell you the narrator and the soundtrack really make the game. The art style is also a nice change from most gritty first person shooters. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/oen386/recommended/286160,1, To clarify, this is an engine to play board games. You can play almost any game you can think of. There have been weekly or at least monthly updates, and they keep adding more features the community requests. I had one issue with the workshop not syncing, and the devs actually worked with Valve to get the issue resolved quickly.  The only problem for new players, is finding games to join. You need to look for groups that host TTS games. An easy one is Tabletop Simulator Club (look for that group in Steam Groups).  Once you play a few games you will realize how great this engine/sandbox is, and if you find a few people to play online with, you will have hours of entertainment.  Last comment, I had to chance to meet the developers at PAX Prime, and they both seemed extremely nice. Can't wait to see where they take TTS next, or their next project. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/oen386/recommended/203770,1, A very slow game, expect games longer than Total War or Civilization. Great fun though! Failing is what leads to the chaos and fun.  Watch while your uncle raises rebels to take your crown, or your son murders you so he can inherit your throne. Even your brother might throw you in jail.  The different results of all the actions you can take make this game fun to play. Also 32 player multiplayer.  After playing this game for many hours, the narratives you write are quite awesome. You'll also lose a couple of friends once you execute them and their heirs. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/oen386/recommended/413150,1, This is a great game to relax with. It captures the more calming game experiences that were present during the 16bit era, and updates it for modern gaming. There is still some fighting and combat, but most of the action is at a slower pace. I would really enjoy seeing more games like this produced. The care the original developer put into this game is evident at every turn, something that is missing in modern AAA games. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/oen386/recommended/218620,-1, They lied during preorders, didn't deliever at launch what they promised. Now over 2 years later, they still haven't. Just this week, they also decided to give their entie community the middle finger.  Historically their DLC model wasn't terrible, but it never addressed the missing promised features from prelaunch. There was an issue with it, DLC started to introduce power creep, you had to buy the latest DLC to beat the newest enemy they added.  The biggest draw for me to Payday 2, compared to the origianl, were the stealth options each mission was going to have. They've done everything they can to nerf that. First they force you to do missions without any stealth segments, or on multiday heists one part will be loud. Just to imply they support &quot;stealth gameplay&quot;, they give you tiny added experience bonus of completing mission without setting off alarms. The main point is, one way or another you're forced to buy those DLC guns. You'll need the DLC when the mission goes loud because they've nerfed stealth skills, or because one of the days doesn't have a silent option.  The DLC model wasn't terrible cost wise, within a month a they would have it available half off, and then 2-3 months later 75% off. This week they decided that wasn't making them enough money though...  During their &quot;Crimefest&quot;, which is an annual 'thank the community for all their support' they introduced paid guns. You now have to spend ~$2.50 per gun to get the best weapons in the game. Crimefest is supposed to be a week of some smaller free items, instead of their typical DLC pricing, but they gave the community the middle finger, again during their &quot;thank the community event&quot;.  This wouldn't be so terrible, if this wasn't just another bullet point on items they completely lied about during preorders and launch. They have been stating for years they would never put microtransactions in this game, one price to get the full game, and occasional DLC. You can find interviews and event Steam forum posts by the developers up until a few months ago saying there would never be microtransactions. This update, first day of Crimefest, was nothing but implementing microtransactions into the game.  They've lied a lot, but this one took the cake, and I hope the community never forgets.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/southrobin/recommended/413150,1, ? A relaxing farming game that lets you play the game how you like without being too punishing. (Farming, fishing, mining, collecting..) Best played going in blind, then learning as you go along. Has high replayability and has many mods to improve the QoL of the game. Now even has multiplayer. Overall: 9/10  ? Pros: + Calming farming game that isn't too punishing. + Has many secrets, still learning new things about the game 230h+ into the game. + Easy to pick up, hard to put down. + Has many mods to improve the QoL in game and visual gameplay. + Nice soundtracks. (Eg I love the ice mining level and fall music.) + Good price for the amount of time played in this game. I even bought Stardew for two friends at full price, when I usually wait for sales to buy my games.   ? Neutral: : Chucklefish is the only developer of this game. : Addictive. Play when you have a lot of time to spare.  ? Cons: - Some useful tips (such as clicking longer on the upgraded watering can to water more tiles) are not stated in game. You have to discover it for yourself. - Game starts out slow for the first 4-7 days. (Picks up later.) - May not be for people who dislike calming games / are purely into FPS games. - Several bugs in multiplayer mode. (Luckily relatively minor)  ? Overall: 9 / 10, would farm again.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/southrobin/recommended/334230,1, Try the free browser version before deciding! If helpful, refer me: Southrobin ?  A 15 player find the murderer mystery game, similar to Werewolf/ Bang/ Mafia. With over 20 roles, the game has a high replayability. If you play with friends and take the community with a pinch of salt, it is enjoyable. Each game usually lasts ~10 - 25 minutes depending on your town.  Overall: 6.5 - 7/ 10  -- Detailed review:--  Summary: Town of Salem is a find the murderer / kill everyone multiplayer game with 15 players. It is similar to Werewolf / Bang / Mafia, set during the Salem Witch Trials. The game is a mix of logic and luck.  You use a chat system to discuss clues and hang the killers via voting. When people die, they usually leave &quot;wills&quot; with info. The Mafia and others will try to lie their way to victory. Can you spot the fakers? Are your &quot;scumreading&quot; skills top-tier? Who can you trust? Are you a master liar? Only time will tell.  Scoring:  ? Art  Subjective/10 - Surprisingly grows on you.  ?Game Idea 8/10 - The premise is based on the Salem Witch trials. The real names are used in game is a nice easter egg. Town of Salem is filled with mystery, and thrill when you survive each night without dying. There is no real gore or horror.  ? Devs 3.5/10 - Updates are semi-slow, but they do listen from time to time. I am personally cautiously optimistic.  ? Replay value 8/10 - There are 33 different roles, 49 with coven dlc which is +$5. With different roles and players each time, towns always change. There is enough to keep you coming back for awhile.  ? Humour 6.5/10 - Killing five people in one night as Werewolf or getting shot by a vigilante for your name. Failing to be lynched as jester because you were too town, or controlling people to their death as witch. Occasional ridiculousness. The basic chat filter also makes swearing funnier.  ? Community 2/10 - Because the online version is free, there are some trolls, bots and spammers. They do have a trial system to weed these out, but it's slower than Nee accounts can be made. If you play with friends or decent players via the party system, you deal with fewer of them. Fun game if you don't take the community seriously.  ? Extra - Extra cosmetics require money similar to dota2. But you can earn about half of them as you play (silver coins) or get a free item every seven days (witches' brew). So I find this alright since the browser game is free.  Overall: 6.5 - 7/10  --- ?Tips:   - Always make a will with your name and role. Write what you do each night. (Eg N1 Healed southrobin, N2 Healed ...) This helps you live longer even if you're evil. - Claim a role when voted up. Usually no role = guilty. The exception is if you're jester. - If one claims the same role as you, its usually better to cc (counterclaim) earlier than later. - Protect confirmed town members or possible TI (town investigatives). They are mafia targets. - Use /w (username or number here)  To whisper to other players. Note that blackmailers can see whispers if there is one. - Veteran, Jailor, Retributionist etc are unique roles. Only one player per round can be them. - Know the short forms for roles and common terms. Doc - Doctor, Vig - Vigilante, Vet - Veteran, Arso - Arsonist, Exe - Executioner, Bm- Blackmail , Cc- Counterclaim etc.   ?PS The difference between this and the free version, is that the steam version has a special steam only skin, $5 gold currency, doubled silver currency, steam achievements, less lag and fewer ads.  I find it worthwhile if gotten via humble bundle, or if you've played at least an hour or two on browser and enjoyed it.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/southrobin/recommended/595280,1, Throne of Lies is a multiplayer social deduction game, similar to Town of Salem/ Werewolf /Mafia /Bang. It is more in depth than ToS, with a nicer community with mods who generally care.  8.5/10 ---  Details: Throne of Lies is a 16 player social deduction murder mystery game, similar to ToS/Werewolf/Mafia/ Bang. Each game usually lasts ~15-30 minutes depending on the court classes. The game is a mix of logic and luck.  Chat is used to discuss clues and hang possible killers via voting. When people die, they leave &quot;logs&quot; with info to help you deduce evils. The Unseen, Cult and Neutral Killers will stop at nothing to lie their way to victory. Can you spot the fakers? Are your &quot;scumreading&quot; skills top-tier?  Differences from Town of Salem: + Nearly every class has Day abilities, Night abilities, AND Passive skills. + Developers heavily moderate reports and take suggestions from the community. + You can &quot;step up&quot; to be the King, whether a good or an evil. Kings can decide the fate of a court and lead it to victory or their demise. + MVP voting system endgame. Rewards players that had the most impact on the game. +- The extra abilities means that ToL has more detail than ToS, and you have more to rememeber for each class.   Pros: + Nicely styled class card art and RPG theme. + Good Developer team. The i42 devs often add patches to change the game's content and take suggestions from the community.  + Good replay value. With different classes and players, courts always change. There is enough to keep you coming back for awhile. + Community. Heavily moderated and personally hand checked reports means the community is much less toxic than ToS. + All cosmetic items can be earned via gold (money, or by winning games), so you don't have to spend extra irl money to get all your items.  Neutral: - Game is still growing, so adding in different modes to increase replayability is not possible at this time.  Cons: - Game is still growing, so getting a full lobby can take 5-10 mins during off peak hours. - Might be hard on a first time player to learn all the details. (Check out some ToL videos to have a vague idea before starting) - Hard to master. Need hours to understand classes in depth. - If you prefer a lighter and less in depth social deduction game, ToS might be your bet. - If you're a racist/toxic person, this is not a game for you.  --- ? Tip: - Always make logs with what you do each day, and use your class abilities!  Overall: A more challenging social deduction game than town of salem, with a better community. 8.5/10.

(Eg 6 islands on Stockholm, with only 5 bridges? No option to get more in my playthrough.) - Sometimes the passengers get impatient a little too easily. - CIRCLES  Overall: 8 / 10, would circle again.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/SupermarineMKS/recommended/17460,1, I first bought Mass Effect, played 40 minutes and shelved it 6 months. Only after I gave it a second chance I truly discovered  the jewel this sci-fi RPG is.  The story is compelling and the background is rich, capable of going toe to toe with the best RPGs and even film franchises like Star Trek. The philosophical scope is intriguing and profound, be it about the origins of the universe, racism or politics.  Some aspects are rather unpolished (like the inventory system) or just plain confusing (like the battle interface) but in general the game is enjoyable if you have the patience to invest in it. It is now one of my favorite game franchises. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/SupermarineMKS/recommended/203160,1, This game is simply gorgeous. The graphics and sounds are rich and immersive.  Gameplay is true to the franchise and if you like previous Tomb Rider titles you can't go wrong on this one. There's everything: strange places to explore, tombs and corpses, lurking enemies and dangerous animals, just like the good old times. this time a very light RPG-like skill point system lets you choose and refine your tomb-riding abilities. No swimming or riding vehicles in this one, but you get a bow which is very fun to use.  Lara has become more human and the environment more real and unforgiving. The story won't win an Oscar soon but is not bad either. I find this last step in the franchise evolution a solid one, and even deserving a sequel.  Tomb Rider is playable in a wide range of systems due to its spec flexibility. MP is a weakness but not as they want you to believe. A bit laggy, a bit confusing and lacking players, the maps are interesting and the weapons accept some grade of customization. Download all single player content (minus cheats) and don't get the rest until you have actually tried MP. Most is aesthetic, and the Hitman guns unecessary. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/SupermarineMKS/recommended/200510,1, Almost tactically perfect and strategically sound, XCOM features a very polished experience.  Defend the Earth from the stereotypical invaders with ever-evolving weapons and research to even the odds. Build a base, hire more soldiers, train them, mourn them and juggle your priorities. The one-more-turn syndrome at its best. Lots of customisation options will give your soldiers distinct personalities (at least for you) and you'll have to take care of your team if you are to succeed.  A reimagining of very old game that builds on good premises and an interesting story, XCOM will keep you on your toes both on the battlefield and in the Command Room. Higher difficulties offer a painful---but fun---gameplay, complete with permadeath and tough economic decisions. The requirements are flexible enough to accomodate for fairly old systems and laptops.  One thing that deserves to be mentioned: do not expect ancient X-COM mechanics because this is not the same game. Even if somewhat simplified in comparison, this modern tribute never fails to deliver. It is a fine iteration better suited for current times.  If you like aliens, RTTs or strategy board games, you should seriously give this game a try. The expansion Enemy Within is a must; it adds so much to the game that it should be installed and played right from the beginning.  Highly recommended. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/SupermarineMKS/recommended/225080,1, There are people who very heavily complain about stories and games. They say &quot;if I wanted stories, I'd go watch a movie&quot;. Other people just feel that games without a story are unengaging and arid. To both groups I recommend  Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons . Both will gain a new perspective.  Rarely a game manages to deliver such rich, emotional and well-developed storytelling. As a lifelong gamer, voracious reader and a professional that understands the power of drama, I can tell you that this game has it all. Every single element shows the maximum attention to detail, storywise.   Careful planning and masterful presentation are noticeable at every single moment. Only a master storyteller, playwright or writer can achieve this. Music, setting, colors, sounds, environment, level design, camera angles, zooming, pacing, &quot;dialogue&quot; and a hint of mystery here and there make this game a superb and very enjoyable experience.   The world is rich and interesting and the characters are empathic and show more personality in 3 hours' worth of playing than most others from famous lengthy franchises or dull modern novels/movies. In a time and age of predictable endings, cookie-cutter stories, boring conventional scripting, forced and faked emotional stimuli and lame plot twists,  Brothers  brings a breath of fresh air.  Yes, the game is quite short for today's gaming standards. Bear in mind though that the narrative is excellent and the duration is perfect. Think theater or cinema: more than 3 hours would be just too much. This is more akin to that than to Call of Duty, Minecraft or Super Mario.  The controls at first are awkward but soon you'll get used to them. A gamepad is strongly recommended, and there's a reason for that.  I am quite sure that you've never played a game like this. Bought it on sale; after finishing I would have gladly paid twice the regular price. The developers deserve it. It is that good. Maybe not a game for everyone, but definitely one worth playing.  Unconditionally recommended. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/SupermarineMKS/recommended/227320,1, Serious software for serious people. If you care about your finances, this is a great help.  Simple and smooth interface, quick to use but surprisingly deep once you understand the underlying philosophy. Yes, the learning curve is somewhat steep---at least more  than expected at first sight. I've tried many, but this has been the expense tracker that made the difference. Once I used it I ditched all the others. Good (and very fast) customer service.  It is worth its current price. I know it is more expensive than a game, but heck, this is real life you're playing here. One of the very few programs in Steam that can actually change your future.  Highly recommended. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/SupermarineMKS/recommended/292030,1, A game that plays like a movie; with compelling characters and intricate storyline, set in a huge world with lots of things to do and places to discover. Excellent visuals and superb voice acting complete the experience for the flagship game of a successful franchise: increasingly polished series, ending with a true masterpiece.  This game is centered on its main story, and has lots of cutscenes and dialogue. It was designed like an interactive movie with lots of rich, interesting characters and meaningful decisions. Do not expect continuous, mindless combat or a dull, weapon-collecting, inventory-centered experience.   The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt  is a game to enjoy at ease, taking time to appreciate the environment and to understand the lore. There is so much content and quests that no two gameplays will be the same. You can play for 60 hours, finish the main quest and storyline and still have half the game¡¯s content to see.  The quests are really detailed and well thought, a far cry from mindless fetch, kill and gather missions that plague so many other games, be them action, RPG or hack and slash. Every quest in  The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt  comes together as a coherent piece of a complex universe, entangled in the politics of war, the difficulties of survival and the grim existence in a morally-ambiguous world.  Several decisions made by the player can be game-changing, and you will live to see the consequences of many of your actions, even small and unimportant-looking ones.  The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt  has different endings, depending on what you did and who you chose to help (or not).   Killed characters are gone for good, and most quests will present options that do not exactly adhere to the regular good-or-evil clear-cut paths that most other games take for granted. Not even choosing a lover will be an easy decision for Geralt de Rivia.  This is a game aimed at adults, with lots of intrigue, corruption, murder, prostitution, racism, exploitation, crime, nudity and sex. The combat animations are gory and brutal, featuring plenty of beheading and dismemberment.  The sprawling, immersive world was painstakingly created, and it shows. The attention to details is astonishing, be it the texture of an armor, the warpaint of an enemy or the design of a mountain stronghold. The lighting, shadows and water effects make for very beautiful landscapes. The only environmental effect I find not quite to my liking is the propensity for very strong winds, which shake the trees but leave the smoke from chimneys intact, thus breaking the immersion a bit. The music is adequate and sets the right tone. However, there should be more moments of silence every now and then.  The combat is serviceable and the controls could be somewhat improved, but this is not a specialized action or hack and slash game. The real-time menu for weapons, signs and bombs is quite uncomfortable, and aiming the crossbow is hard with a controller, but the responsiveness of the actions is generally good. Another thing I dislike is Geralt¡¯s weird, jumpy death animation.  Those that want to roleplay should bear in mind that this is not an RPG, but a game with RPG elements. You cannot create or heavily customize characters, apart from clothing and some of Geralt¡¯s skills, and you cannot¡ªand should not¡ªgo crazy over DPS stats and numbers. This is no fault or mistake;  The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt  was simply not designed that way.  The DLCs are some of the best I¡¯ve seen, generously adding to the main experience and providing new story arcs, places characters and equipment. Lots of Free-LC enable even more customizing options.  Gwent , the game-within-a-game, is an interesting take on minigames from previous installments of this franchise. Easy to learn, quick to play and with an interesting amount of strategy, will keep most completionists looking for cards right until the very end of the main quest.  With its few flaws and quirks,  The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt  can still be considered a masterpiece of gaming and a new classic of mixed-genre, bringing together elements of storytelling, RPGs, action and open world games.  Of course, no manmade project can ever be perfect, but you don¡¯t criticize Picasso¡¯s  Guernica  or Leonardo¡¯s  Gioconda  by focusing only on their glitches and flaws. What makes a classic is both  uniqueness worthy of imitation  and the  timeless relevance  that will keep the object on sight for generations to come. Both Picasso and Da Vinci achieved that, as well as Mozart, Lloyd Wright, Shakespeare, and yes,  The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt .  For sure, one of the highlights of modern gaming and among the best games ever created.  The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt  was met with near-universal acclaim, and such reputation is well earned.  Unconditionally recommended. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/SupermarineMKS/recommended/24980,1, An absolute improvement over ME1, altough not perfect.  Controls are completely revamped; confusing at first if you were expecting the same as ME1. The pace is quicker and the gameplay more fluid and interesting. The plot has some twists and the narrative is better. There are varoius ways to end this adventure, all different depending on what you did and how you played. You can feel the consecuences of your actions. The final mission is one of the best I've ever played: complex, dramatic, not absurdly hard but not easier either, and it will make you care for your crew and squadmates.  Story is better and richer, and the drama more polished. The game knows how to keep tension, both aboard the Normandy and in combat. The variety of missions means you'll not get bored with repetitiveness as in some other games. The music sets the ambience darker than the first game, but still top notch.  Mass Effect universe's lore keeps expanding, new characters bring alternatives and the old ones return, but with little participation. Philosophical issues keep the conversations smart for those with intellect, and nice voice acting will satisfy the impatient. Romance has now more options.  The devs got rid of the confusing inventory system in favor of a bare-bones approach to weapons that completely removes the RPG-item feel. This is not necesarily a bad thing. The character building also got simpler.  Mako exploration with its super-steep mountains is gone for good. DLC has a nicer hover vehicle, more agile and fun. I recommend getting the Digital Deluxe Edition: the extra content is worth it.  If you own ME1 and liked it, do yourself a favor and play Mass Effect 2. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/SupermarineMKS/recommended/250320,1, Masterfully written and masterfully drawn,  The Wolf Among Us  surprises with an unique personality and original setting, combined with the developer's already well-known dramatic storytelling.  I bought this game more than a year ago and shelved it. The premise sounded interesting, but not enough to play immediately. Now that the first (and probably only) season is over, I decided to try it and discovered a very polished experience, more personal and gritty than  The Walking Dead , and also more engaging.  Art direction is simply astounding. The graphics are superb, quality-wise. Even if you don't like cel shading you have to admit the devs did a very good job, and the comic book-like drawings set the atmosphere delightfully. Sounds and music are also top-notch. The lip-sync is perfect and the voice acting professionally convincing.  Gameplay-wise, the experience is immersing and compelling. I did not encounter a single glitch, lag or bug. The controls are simple and work fine, even though I would prefer to use E instead of Q for the action sequence QTEs. Divided by episodes and chapters, it can adapt to long play sessions as well as 15-minute rounds.  Where this game really shines is, of course, the story. Drawing inspiration, direction and lore from the original books, there's much more to be seen that can be noticed at first sight. This provides a wholesome world with fleshed-out, mature characters and an interesting background, connecting seamlessly to the parent storyline. Be not mistaken, this drama is not for children. Also, be prepared for a shocking shift in the way you'll forever look at your classic fairytale characters. Many of them are here, and there's no &quot;happily ever after&quot;. Illegal drugs and magic, prostitution, exploitation, murder and a very important dose of gore and violence populate this game/visual novel/point-and-click RPG-ish adventure. If you're into dark fantasy, rough drama and noir mystery-solving detective stories, this might be right up your alley.   Tell Tale Games  at it's finest, and another very nice gaming experience. This game was met with universal acclaim and there's a reason for that.  Highly Recommended.  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/SupermarineMKS/recommended/34330,1, A polished experience with attention to details and immersive gameplay. Shogun 2 is a serious upgrade to the Total War franchise and for sure the best iteration so far.  At first the Sengoku Jidai historical period might seem confusing, with lots of names and places true to the Japanese medieval setting, but after some time the essence of TW games surfaces as strong as ever. The campaigns might get long but never boring.  The art and design is impeccably well presented, and the music is top-notch, even if somewhat repetitive when playing long sessions. The graphics are good and adaptable to a wide range of PCs. The interface is clear and beautiful, and I never encountered a glitch or bug in 70+ hours of gameplay.  The new mechanic of Realm Divide brings freshness and challenge to the stalled and/or boring mid-to-endgame, and is a very welcome feature that will divide the weak and inconsistent from the true strategists. The AI is really not that smart, and makes very illogical decisions---many times downright stupid---when playing the lower difficulties. The best experience comes playing on Hard and above, and of course the light RPG-like multiplayer avatar system.  Shogun 2 can entertain you for hours. With high replayability and infinite options, no campaign is ever the same. All DLC is worth having.  If you liked previous Total War games, this is a must own. Highly recommended. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/SupermarineMKS/recommended/400,1, Alone in its category and revolutionary in its concept, Portal is a game that any serious gamer should play from start to finish at least once.  Simple and elegant mechanics and fluid gameplay combine with a sophisticated puzzle style, impeccable design and a dash of clever, dark humour. Only two characters populate the antiseptic world of Portal---one of them never actually speaks---but that does not substract from its well-planned drama and immersive experience.  The graphics are excellent for its time and still serviceable for modern audiences. Controls are easy and the &quot;tutorial&quot; vast and adequate. You will find yourself very soon immersed in this strange, mysterious world if you are to give it a short try.  Short by today's standards, the story is nevertheless rich and compelling. The voice acting is top-notch and the music simple but adequate.  A mandatory step in the process of understanding videogame history, Portal is a true classic that even years after its initial release never fails to deliver.  Unconditionally recommended. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/REVVAND/recommended/550900,-1, Stay away from this garbage cash grab dying game. Gameforge is the most money hungry gaming related company that has ever existed. I've been playing this garbage game since 2009 and spent thousands of hours playing it, game used to be a lot of fun in 2009-2012 but they ruined it and their game is dying because of it.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/REVVAND/recommended/942140,1, More endings than Telltale's The Walking Dead. Very immersive game, so immersive my mom actually walked in on me while playing and I couldn't ever hear her over how immersed I was! I can strongly recommend this game to each and every one of my friends, and if you're like me and have over a decade of experience in this field then you'll get over the learning curve in no time! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/REVVAND/recommended/334230,1, If your hatred for mankind is off the charts, get this game. Or just play the browser version because it's free. It'll be a wake up call and you will soon come to realize that you are surrounded by actual simpletons. But really, this is the best free game I've ever paid for. It can be lots of fun or it can be really frustrating.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/REVVAND/recommended/218620,1, At first I thought this game was about robbing banks with friends, but then I realized that we were the ones getting robbed. Best DLC simulator on the market right now 9.5/10. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/REVVAND/recommended/282070,1, When death awaits around every corner, you're going to have to make some tough choices. Are you going to forget about morals and just do whatever is necessary to ensure your group's safety, or are you going to go out of your way to help people in need? This game really is a masterpiece. The characters feel very genuine, they're just like you and me, they have their own flaws and strengths but at the end of the day, you have to survive. And that is not an easy task. Losing someone really feels terrible. Going out on supply runs during the night makes you feel uneasy, knowing that it might be the last time you ever walk through that door, knowing that you might never return to see your friends again and knowing that they're counting on you to come back home with a few cans of food or some medicine.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/dotthat/recommended/213670,1, My only problem with the game is that it's too short. Otherwise, it has the same feeling as the South Park episodes, but in a game form. This game is a must if you're a big South Park fan as there are lots of references to the episodes, so the game gets even funnier when you get all those references.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/marksmanozzzy/recommended/322330,1, I always thought Don't Starve would be better with friends so it was easy for me to purchase this game. It is definitely much more entertaining and fun playing with others but sometimes your friends can be the opposite of helpful; like burning the entire camp to the ground in winter or aggrivating the Treeguards because of thier beaver rampage. Regardless we always had a lot of fun playing. Like it's predecessor, it stays true to the Tim Burton esque feel and has the same survival mechanics. Definitely worth it although I do believe I did not purchase this game at full price but during a sale. Even so, I would say that it is priced resasonably. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/glory_of_god/recommended/374570,1, That was awesome!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/iamaya2/recommended/421810,1, I think I have never made a public review before, so here goes nothing.  Before starting, I would like to say I won this game on a giveaway thanks to the developer promoting the game through that site, so I am unsure about the free checkbox the review asks for...   ---------------------- What I liked:  This is an RPG-maker game, and I love RPG's :) What I was able to perceive about the story  The ability to improve weapons/armor/items The ability to call upon other heroes to &quot;borrow&quot; their abilities (not sure if this is allowed throughout the game or just in the tutorial) The fact that some weapons allowed multiple hits The &quot;evalution&quot; at the end of the stage  ---------------------- What I disliked:  As soon as I tried entering the first village (right after the swamp), the game crashed ;_;  Not sure if it is Win 10 related or something like that but that should be fixed ASAP After trying to recover the game, I found that it did not make an autosave when in the world map. So, my progress since the last save spot was lost I could retrace my steps back to entering the village, but the thought of the game crashing on me again made me lose interest :(  ---------------------- Overview/Recommendation:  In a broad sense, I would recommend this game. The only thing that I found cumbersome was the game crashing on me and no recent autosave to help me out. Should the developers fix this, I would recommend the game with no reserves (or at least I could be able to play longer and improve my review)...   Hope this helps some of you make a decision :)

https://steamcommunity.com/id/marksmanozzzy/recommended/224480,1, Octodad: Dadliest Catch has a very charming plot &amp; is worth the awkward, sometimes tedious game play to see through to the end. Play with a controller; walking in the right direction is rather difficult on its own &amp; there are many times in which you are required to climb. It is worth it to complete the story as, imo, the best reveal is at the end.  Beware of the rogue tentacle!! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/iamaya2/recommended/413150,1, I can say a lot of pretty good stuff about this game, but I will try to itemize:  Pros:    + Minigames are great and varied    + There is a lot of things you can do    + Each &quot;playthrough&quot; should be relatively &quot;short&quot; (there is an event after the first two years that most people count as being the end of the game, though you can keep playing. Also, you need quite some real-life hours for each playthrough)    + Good replayability since you can choose different maps for your farm and take different paths as you play  Cons:    - You will probably end up loosing some hours of sleep since time will fly while playing this game... you have been warned! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/iamaya2/recommended/242760,1, Great game if you like putting your skills to the test.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/marksmanozzzy/recommended/448510,1, I purchased Overcooked: Gourmet Edition during a Steam sale. Overall, it is a fun local co-op game but it REALLY does need online multiplayer; especially for those days when no one in the household wants to be player two. Completing a kitchen by yourself with three stars is doable but it's both more enjoyable &amp; less strenuous with more people (obviously). Definitely recommend playing with a controller vs. keyboard. Also, I would have liked to have seen additional recipe combinations &amp; kitchen layouts. I would say it currently offers less than what it could offer. I still recommend this game but am not sure it's worth the regular price without online multiplayer.   
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ivanleterrible/recommended/460790,1,  Bayonetta is an over the top Hack and Slash game produced by the famous dev Platinum Games    Story  The story in this game is highly non nonsensical, but it spins around the old battle between the Umbra Witches, who represent Dark; and the Lumen Sages, who represent light. The protagonist, the witch Bayonetta, is cough in between the conflict and also amid a sinister plot to resurrect an ancient divine being   Game play  Game play is a very good hack and slash game, somehow similar to the Devil May Cry series. As Bayonetta, you can jump, shoot infinite shots with your gun, you have a punch and a kick button, and finally you can dodge, which is an important mechanic, since dodging is related to the power of witch time (slow motion). You must combine those many kind of attacks to perform combos and defeat the enemies.    Unlockables  As you progress in the game, you will unlock a lot of stuff, including a few weapons, many strange items and some other stuff. When you beat the game, you will unlock some costumes and characters, along with a cool gallery mode.  So good to see all these Unlockables things given to you as you play the game, instead of just being sold as DLC, which is what happens in most games now-a-days¡­   The Bad Side  This game is very good, but make no mistake: it¡¯s also filled with bull schit. The worst are by far the quick time events: You are sitting and watching some cool and provocative cut scene, when suddenly the game shows on the screen that you might press quickly ¡°up + jump¡±. You have like 2 seconds to do so, otherwise you are insta killed! Those insta kill quick time event are unfortunately all over the place in this game, and this breaks the flow of the game, as you are constantly dying for stupid reasons. Take that away and you would have a perfect game.   Game is a very good Slasher Overall    I give it a 4.5/5.0  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ivanleterrible/recommended/729450,-1, Not recommended because: Season Pass dat does not include all the dlcs released.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/ivanleterrible/recommended/322500,1, Superhot is an experimental first person shooter. Graphics are simple but good: the whole environment is white, weapons are black and enemies are red. Weapons include a pistol, shotgun, katana, your fists, etc.  ... The standout feature is that the time is slowed down while you aren't moving, so that you have enough time to plan you next move. The action thus goes like this: you slow down time to think then you speed up to attack. This gives you such a rush of adrenaline! The down side is that the game is short. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ivanleterrible/recommended/271590,-1, This game is waaay too overhyped. I mean: you spend 90% of the game time in boring driving across the city instead of actually doing cool stuff like shooting cops, smoking dope or selling coke.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/ivanleterrible/recommended/627270,1,  Story   Injustice 2 is fighting game heavely focused on the its story. It envolves a terrible multidimensionmal crisis surrounding most of the DC comics heroes and villains, such as Super Man, Batman, Super girl, Green Lantern. and others. The plot starts with the arrival of Super Girl on earth and the discovery that the same destructive force that destroided Krypton years ago in now intenting to destroy earth itself. The heroes are still divided by the feud created by batman and superman man, where batman thinks its not correct and is a crime to kill people, even if they are criminals. Superman, on the other hand, thinks that some crimes are far to terrible to recieve redemptioin, and that the criminal must be execulted altright. Thus, with the justice league broken in two, they have to face the graetest threat that mankind has ever faced: Brainiac   Gameplay  The gamplay is pretty much a mix between Mortal Kombat with some street fighter motions here and there. Be awear that, as in previous game, zoning and ranged attacks are far too powerful in this game and learning how to use them and how to avoided them is a core feature if you want to play online.     Overal, its a pretty much solid fighter, with a superb story mode and good fighting mechanics. Recommened for both people who play fighters regulary and to people who are just fans of DC comics in gerneral;	    I give it 4.4/5.0  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jude3e/recommended/480490,1, Great game, unsatisfactory ending. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/P97/recommended/218620,-1, Used to be a good co-op game. Then it started to snow with DLCs that makes no sense at all...  In short: all of the negative reviews about DLCs and micro-transactions are correct.  If you're new to this game, it may seem like fun ( keep it up that way), but for us who were playing this game from the very first day of it's release - tragedy, comparing to what we had two years ago.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/ivanleterrible/recommended/389730,1,  One of the best fighters avalible on Steam!    Story  They added a story mode this time, teeling about the feud in the Mishima family, where Kazuya wants revenge against his father Heihachi. The story has its moments, but is not that good overal, if compared to say, Mortal Kombat or Injustice. But the final battle scenes are really amzing, though.   Gameplay  As a general rule, Tekken is a very beginner friendly game, but with a secretly deep learning curve. You can mash buttons and get away with it in the begining, so if you are not a hardcore fighting game player you can still have lots of fun with this game. However, if you want to go deep into its mechanics, you gotta learn how to do the advanced moving stuff, complex combos and frame dat, so there is plenty of room for serious players too.   Customization  This game has a really amazing customization system! You have tons of clothes, outfits and options to make you character look like some kinda of evil badazz or, more likely, like a circus clown. There is just too many customization options. You can easly spend dozen of hours just customizing or characters, it's that much fun!   Overall, it's a pretty solid and fun fighter    I give it 4,8/5.0

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Apinasan/recommended/33230,1, This game is great. Great story, gameplay and music. Graphics are decent. Story is quite long in this game and you don't have the feeling it was too short like many games these days. I only had some issues with controls. Keyboard controls in this game are little weird and takes some time to get familiar with. Game prompting you to press &quot;head symbol&quot; button or &quot;empty hand&quot; button etc. I had to check keyboard configuration several times to see which symbol is which button, but don't let that stop you from byuing/playing this game. It's realy good game overall. I enjoyed playing this game alot and recommend it to everyone.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/ivanleterrible/recommended/208650,1,  Amazing game! One of the best games I've ever played!    Story  The story spins around a fear gas bomb that Scarecrow unleashed upon Gotham, leaving all the city empty for the bandits to plunder and do as they see fit. So you have all the classic Batman villains on the loose, like Two-Face, Penguin, etc... As for the Joker, he might have died in the previous games, but don't wory: he will show up everytime in this game, with a special surprise for Batman   Gameplay  The gameplay is based on the freeflow combat, which is typical for most WarnerBros game: you have one button for strikes, another for counters, one for gadgets, etc. This gives combat a much more cinematic feeling, looking just like some kind of action movie. Another point is that now there is the addition of the Batmobile, which can be used as a car to drive or as a tank to shoot.   Optimization  Unfortunately, this game is not yet very optimized eventhough it was patched many times. I get some serious framedrop issues when Im driving through the city with the batmobile. But when Im playing as Batman alone, outside of the car, the game runs fine.   Overall, this game is a must play for all comics and action movie fans!    I give it a 4.8/5.0

Bearing down the extremly Tactical plot of Tom Clancy and the oh-god-damn-his-face-exploded kind of Tactical Gameplay , the game is beautifully made (however the graphics consumption is a wee bit too high). The class systems is well made , however the grinding part is a grind. (pun totally not intended)  Just fix the Graphics and the Network issues , then we can talk about it.  Worth the money : Somewhat Worth the price : Yes Worth the Effort : Yes 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ivanleterrible/recommended/678950,1,  Very good game! You will really enjoy it even if you are not an anime fan, like myself.  Hell, you might enjoy it even if you dont like fighting games at all!    Story  The story mode is actually pretty dull and boring, mostly because its too long and takes more than 12 hours to complete. Im not gonna spoil the story, but it spins around the arrival of a new Android threat in the Dragon Ball universe. The story is divided into 3 arcs: the first one is centered around Goku and the &quot;good guys&quot;. The Second arc is around Frieza and the &quot;bad guys&quot;, like Cell. And the Final Arc is around the androids. Once you complete the story mode you will unlock the boss as a playable character..   Gameplay  Generally speaking, the gameplay reminds me of a faster and more agressive version of Marvel vs Capcom. The gameplay in this game is divided into many layers. The first layer if for mashers: you can perform basic combos by just mashing the attack buttons. However, those combos are not well optimized and deal less damage. If you really want to go deep into the combo system and stop mashing, you will discover that the true good and damaging combos are very complex and demand many hours of practice in the training mode. The game also has lots of other mechanics that need to be know and mastered befor you can consider yourself a descent player. The learning curse is really high and the skill gap between a good player and a bad one is enormous.   Visuals  The visuals in this game are astonishing! Through a new cell shading technique, ArcSystems managed to make 3d characters and environments look EXACTLY like the anime, if not better! The final product is a 3d fighting game that looks like 2d hand drawn manga. Really and impressive sight to behold!   Optimization  Game is very well optimized and runs fine in most PCs. As a side note, I was able to run the game even without a proper graphics card, using only my onboard GPU.   Overall, this game kicks azz and totally overthoned Marvel vs Crapcom as the new fast paced tag fighter.    I give it 4.8/5/0

It could have used a few more maps and better controller support, but if you get this on a sale for a few bucks it's well worth it.  I give this game four Sack Taps and a Benihana.

Along that , it also provides with a minor upgrade in being a werewolf. The story adds many Characters whom you will be loving soon and will want to marry one. But being a man that loves the story and the lord , I fell in love with Skyrim again. The falmers , Dwemer , Akatosh and Hircine have a good story and beautiful upgrades.

One of my Friends recommended me this , he is a top tier Dota Gamer. First 22 Hours went by just learning the Game and It's HUD and It's overly detailed customization. I can now play like 3 heroes. I can't compare it to other MMORPG since I've played none.  However the HUD and tutorial could've been better.

You play through the game as three characters and you're not gonna make it a 3-player co-op game!? What's the point, wasted potential... also modding has just been banned. Can't have players making their own free content that could be sold as DLC instead!

It rarely happens when you get a good execution , but a bad Idea. Here you have it. But the game CAN be played in a full lobby and with external voice chat.  I won't refer it to a friend , a foe can have it. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ahologic/recommended/230410,1, Wow , This much time and I didn't reviewed Warframe.  I started playing this game much ago in Beta and played with my First Steam account (forgot it :( ) , and loved it since then. While the game requires a lot of grinding and leveling up , it is actually worth it. The Crafting and Modifications give it a strategical edge. You can choose the method you want to play it , My friend goes for High-Paced close-quarter combat , while I prefer mid-far range combat. All those Styles give you a unique edge and the mission can be completed in more than a single way. Extremly fun Game and was the Ideal kind of MMORPG i was looking for.  Don't Call it Space Ninjas , they are the Ten'No.

That depends, if your like programing and are not completely intimate with Assembly , then this might be a fun puzzle (game?). And to whether TIS-100 has enough content for the price, like all puzzle games, it depends how dense you are. But, if you're anything like me, you'll get plenty of hours out of it. If you've never programed before, I'd recomend playing something else, the pdf handbook thing would be a little challenging to comprehend without knowledge of basic computer jargon.  In total, if you like program-ey things and/or pressing buttons, this might be a fun game(?) for you.

It was really nice to play through my childhood horror movies, couldn't actually pinpoint where Manhattan Manslaughter movies got it roots though. Still this game helped me survive my easter holiday with dreaded inlaws :) 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/postuumi/recommended/105600,1, Decided to run through this game once more to get the new stuff. Still the game is fun and like most of the games its even better with friends. Only part I feel a bit torn with is that finding all the bosses / fun items need a wiki or a lot time and patience. So with little better hints at what to do this game could be even better.   Basicly play this if you like to hoard all the things and can manage to survive through basic sidescroller combat. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198145308064/recommended/322330,1, There's way too much content for the price, and Klei keeps adding more. The developers have a very unique sense of humor in their naming schemes and recipes, to the point that everything makes sense. Moles in guacamole, butterflies are the sole source of butter, and the survival tab for crafting is denoted by a noose.   The art is unique, sound is fantastic, and gameplay will keep you occupied until you end up starving.  The additional game modes &quot;forge&quot; and &quot;gorge&quot; are incredibly fun, and don't share many mechanics with the base game.   The only real downside is the innate problems of multiplayer, which for the most-part is pretty minimal. Any real issues you may have can be modded out. Player count can make certain objectives very difficult so try to get at least a party of three. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/postuumi/recommended/235360,-1, Decent tower defence game with few annoing rpg aspects and a lacking guiding the creeps feature on 80% of levels. You unlock towers at random and some point grinding for levels, exp and/or silver may be required, atleast it was for me. But if that isnt too big of a problem for you then this game will give you many hours worth of content.  edit: Developer has disabled previously available features. Mobile seems to be the new priority. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/postuumi/recommended/231160,1, It has about 3 to 4 hours worth of good puzzles in it. I recommend that you use achievement guide for more story bits those are tough to find otherwise. Also the atmosphere is great if you like scifi setting. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/postuumi/recommended/204530,1, Great addition to RTS collection if one likes that genre. Command your starshiptroopers to victory against the horde.  Let me put it this way, if you are decent at RTS genre(hotkeys over mouseclicking) and you have the patience to learn few tactics to beat different kind enemies. You will enjoy this game. The game has a good way to help if you get stuck with one time use soldiers so don't be afraid of the alien hordes. Check TB's WTF is... for good gameplay preview if still on the edge. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198145308064/recommended/524220,1, There are definitly some huge issues with this game that shouldn't be ignored.     Gameplay issues mostly extend to the inability to pause during some segments, the first stretch of the game being fairly difficult without controller and any death means a complete restart, and odd triggers to events that could lock out sidequests/change things that you haven't explored.     The port isn't great, buggy stuff will happen (crashes, whitescreens, incomplete keyboard support, general slowdowns) and it's pretty annoying but as long as you save frequently you should be fine.     A lot of the sidequests are fetch quests, kinda shrinks the world a bit since you end up going back to places a bunch.  If you can deal with that, you will probably really enjoy the game. The characters designs are fantastic and everything has a place in the world. The combat has depth and rewards engagement. Definitly a game to pick up if you have the money and time.   
https://steamcommunity.com/id/zoburg/recommended/252490,-1, This game is unplayable in a public server, if you want an enjoyable experience get 20+ friends and rent a server to play on, you won't get raided randomly, you can have honour rules, and you can choose mods to install, this game used to be excellent but just turned into a grind fest, like I used to play 1 hour a day with 3 friends and we had a decent base, we only got raided 1-2 times a week and people didn't KOS, now it seems to take forever to even get a semi functional base with the bare minimum

https://steamcommunity.com/id/zoburg/recommended/218620,1, Great vr game, and great game in general (not required but I personally highly recommend it)  The vr movement mode could use tweaks, because in the may weather heist (forget the name, it's where you have to steal x amount of bags stealthily from a shipping company at night, guarded by mayweather), you can't make the rooftop jump (the one where you climb up the ladder), there are also a few jumps I can't make elsewhere (some are actually game breaking and I'm forced to use the keyboard), so it would br nice if a jump button was added (in vr, not the regular, because I know if I don't put this people will be like &quot;tHe SpAcEbAR iS tHe JuMp KeY&quot;, even though I mentioned it at the beginning of this paragraph)

https://steamcommunity.com/id/kiggamcg/recommended/219150,1, There is no way I am not voting for this game for the steam awards. It really deserves it. This game is brutally violent yet beautiful. It packs excellent fast-paced top-down shooter gameplay, a unique but crazy and trippy storyline and characters, and a kickass soundtrack to jam to while you carry out mass slaughter. Everything about the game just fits perfectly together and it is easily one of my favorite games. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/zoburg/recommended/537800,1, It's good, but not $17(cdn) good 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/435400,1, I think the game is simple enough that it speaks for itself -- it's a &quot;Where's Waldo&quot; (Wally)-esque puzzle game where you look at huge open world drawings and attempt to find a series of objects within them. The aesthetics are black and white line work and the audio is cute. I think this is a really great realization of the premise, at about 3-4 hours worth of content I think the price is fair. The one thing I'd add is that this probably targets an age range slightly above Where's Waldo, since it's somewhat difficult relative to those books. The developer was and continues to be responsive to issues and has updated the game with free add-on content, so I think you can also feel pretty good supporting this small team. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/kiggamcg/recommended/250320,1, Simply a masterpiece: the art, the story, everything... wish I could say more but these lips are sealed.    But really though, brace yourself for total mindf*ckage.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/kiggamcg/recommended/384190,1, This game is a stunningly beautiful and breathtaking adventure through various underwater environments. The game utilizes the full spectrum of colors across multiple environments, from bright coral reefs to the dark deep sea. It's a delightful surprise to see what new regions and new sealife you will find next. But what I found most impressive about this game though, was its ability to deliver an interesting story and tell the history of the environment simply through the environment itself. In the beginning, you are just thrown underwater with a quick tutorial of controls but no story is revealed until you go searching for it yourself. The art direction is fantastic in that you learn so much about the background of where you are based on the observations and interactions of your surroundings. This encourages exploration as there's always something fascinating and magical to find through your journey. The game is short (roughly just an hour or two for one playthrough), but if you appreciate pretty open-world games, like to explore and find things, looking for a calming but stimulating experience, or even if you've just always wanted to scuba dive, I definitely recommend this game! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/571060,1, There are basically two things you should know about this game: first, is it a good game; second, is it a good port.  To the first question, Zork Nemesis is among the best first-person point-and-click games of its era, and maybe my favourite outside Cyan Worlds' Myst/Riven. The plot involves you entering an ancient, run-down temple and learning about the plight of four great alchemists who have been trapped in a state of purgatory by an evil presence called Nemesis. Of course, like many great adventure games, things are not as simple as they seem.  It is a great game with tough but fair difficulty, no arbitrary deaths, a great little story, excellent cutscene direction, and really interesting and varied locations. If you take notes you should be able to beat the game without restoring to a guide, but there are also many guides online if you need to cheat. It is well worth the $5.99. The graphics are pre-rendered backgrounds with live action FMV playing on top of them, which at the time was very exciting and cutting edge. Also very nice music and sound effects, they really made the most of the 3 or 4 CDs the game shipped on.   Compared with other games in the genre, it has a darker and more sinister tone. It's not quite horror, but at times it's close: for example, one segment involves you decapitating a cadaver with a guillotine and hooking up the severed head to electrodes. This is not the light-hearted comedy of the traditional Zork games, although there are jokes here and there.  To the second question, I think the quality of the port is mixed. First, the game was released in two versions: Windows 95 and DOS. This is the DOS version, emulated through DOSBOX. There are no achievements, trading cards, gamepad controls, graphical settings, etc. Moreover, the DOS version requires you to use keyboard commands to save (Ctrl+S), load (Ctrl+R), exit (Ctrl+Q), and set options (Ctrl+P) because there are no menus. Please read the manual before you play to help with this. There are two minor technical issues -- some slight sound crackling, and mouse sensitivity is way too high. The bulk of the game is navigated through panning your field of view with the mouse, and so high mouse sensitivity makes it difficult to control. You can set it to a lower sensitivity in the preferences, but even on the lowest setting, it is too sensitive. This appears to be a the  GOG.com  version, which also suffered from these issues.   There is also a question of the game holding up. It runs at 640x480; the FMV overlays are highly compressed, interlaced, low resolution video. Some of the game's beautiful visual designs look blurry or low detail because of the resolution, and there are a handful of puzzles where you must be very very precise with the mouse because click targets are quite small. This is definitely not modernized or ready for 2017, so I would recommend you be sure that you can handle something feeling dated before you jump in.   I highly recommend the game. The playtime listed above is until completion on a replay; someone playing for the first time without a guide would be looking at probably 10-12 hours, maybe a little more. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/kiggamcg/recommended/319510,1, I didn't think I'd be scared of animatronics, but there I was,?????????my pants on night one because Foxy jumped me since I was too stupid and afraid to do anything. Now I can say I'm pretty scared of animatronics. This game is great, not perfect, but it's definitely a satisfying and refreshing take on the horror genre. The controls and gameplay are simple, but it does such a good job at instilling sheer panic and paranoia, that it becomes much harder than it seems. You are forced to fight against your own sense of fear and vulnerabilty in order to save power. The story too is actually very interesting and haunting in itself, especially once you play the later games (fnaf 2/3) as well.   Only 'issue' really is that it doesn't take long to learn the patterns and behaviors of the animatronics, meaning the game becomes more predictable and less scary. It's not too hard to develop a strategy to easily make it through all six nights. However, after all six nights, the game does offer a custom night mode, where you can take on the dreaded 4/20 mode if you dare. It's great because, although it is very challenging and frustrating, it adds replayability of the game and it's very rewarding once you get your strategy down and beat it.   All-in-all this game is solid and I definitely recommend it. Well done Scott! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/vivysworld/recommended/260230,1, Valiant Hearts: Unknown Soldiers. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/925940,1, I write this review for people who have already played Myst, Riven, and Myst III: Exile. and want to know whether to continue playing the series. If you have not played these three games, I suggest you begin with RealMyst Masterpiece Edition and go on from there (maybe buy the Cyan Complete Pack if they update that to include Myst 3 and 4.). The review below contains spoilers for Myst as well as descriptions of the worlds contained in this game.  For everyone else, I think a good review of this game should answer two questions for you: 1) Is this game worth playing if you're a fan of the series? 2) Is the port / release of the game good? (The answers to those questions below the break)  In general I think Myst 4 remains a good game and I would recommend playing it if you are a fan of the series. I do think it is weaker than the first three games, but I think it still justifies the time that it asks of you. I grew up playing Myst and Riven and just recently got the opportunity to complete Myst 3: Exile, but had never touched this game before now. I have to admit that my first impression of the game was not good. The current release is full-screen only and 4:3 resolutions only, so my initial reaction was disappointment in seeing the excellent art design stretched. There is also a design decision that annoyed me up-front and never got better: the transitions between screens are slow, the mouse cursor is sluggish, and in an effort to make the mouse cursor feel more like a hand there are a bunch of animations for the cursor as you mouse over hot spots. This decision makes the entire game feel molasses slow. So, right off the bat, the game had a strike against it.  The plot of the game is that Atrus has summoned you to his home to ask you to visit his sons, Sirrus and Achenar, in the ages he has imprisoned them in, to determine if they have reformed and should be let out. While visiting him, he is called away momentarily. Then, all hell breaks loose. The game plays out over a hub world (Tomahna), two prison ages which can be completed in either order (Spire and Haven), and a finale age (Serenia). The ages are quite large and the game itself feels longer than Myst or Exile for sure. The hub world is beautiful and serves as a good introduction to the game. The two prison ages I liked a lot less -- Spire, specifically, is a beautiful dark prison tower. Is that what Ubisoft Montreal was going for? Yes. But the fact that I do not want to spend time in the age is a bad thing. Haven is more hospitable but suffers from being truly enormous and having in my opinion too many nodes to navigate. I spent more time mapping than solving any real puzzles. The final area, Serenia, is beautiful and enjoyable.  Like the earlier three games, the world design is gorgeous. Sights are frequently breathtaking. I posted a few dozen screenshots for those interested. The engine allows for full 3D looking and every scene is crammed full of layers, animations, and movement. This really does feel like the culmination of the old node-based navigation adventure game. Like the earlier three games, there are some enjoyable puzzles. One in particular, a puzzle involving vibrating crystals, is maybe a little too insane -- the game gives you all the information you need to solve it, but knowing how to apply that information requires a leap I think even seasoned adventure players wouldn't make. The rest of the puzzles in the game seem to me to be basically solveable given effort and the right set of skills. I found Haven disappointing, because the puzzles felt like busywork -- only the climactic puzzle felt like the kind of spatial/logical puzzle Myst is otherwise known for, while the remainder felt like running around and copying down text and symbols to be able to regurgitate them when prompted. Serenia's puzzles are great, although the game's final puzzle was a dud -- easy, annoying, and slow.  The music is a little on the nose, and continues the sweeping, epic tradition of Myst 3: Exile -- but the problem is that it's hard to feel sad, or angry, or scared, or proud when the music is screaming at you to feel sad, or angry, or scared, or proud. I did want to make a positive note about the music. There is a vocal song which appears at a climactic point of the game. I loved this and had no idea going in it would be a thing. The Steam page description spoils it, which is too bad, because I instantly recognized the vocalist and was pleasantly surprised.  I wanted to make one more design complaint / note. In an effort to make the game more interactive, the developers have implemented an audio-log mechanic. The series' famous journals make a return, this time with voice over. But elsewhere, clues are given by using a pendant to &quot;flash back&quot; to memories that took place in various areas. This, I think, is an error. In addition, I feel most of the actors hired specifically for Revelations are not great. Yeesha, who is a constant presence in the beginning of the game, has flat line readings even for a kid, and the maidens of Serenia are clearly locally hired Montreal actors with accents that distract from the dialogue delivered. I attribute the poor voice direction to the game being developed by a french-first language team. Not that there's anything wrong with French, and maybe I should have simply played the game in French instead.  In terms of whether this is a good port / release? Not especially, no. I mentioned the stretched resolution and overall sluggishness above. I also think the UI as implemented in the original game is poor and could use a touch-up. The maximum resolution is still fairly low which means subtitles and UI stuff looks pretty bad. No achievements or trading cards. I didn't encounter any real bugs and I wouldn't recommend you avoid it on technical grounds, but if you were hoping for improvements, there are none, and if you already own the game on disc I don't think there are any strong reasons to buy it here.  As with any Myst game, good luck solving the puzzles and please try to resist the modern urge to immediately seek a hint (the game does have a sort of preliminary in-line hint system but I don't think it's very useful for the one puzzle where you'll really need one). Walk around, play with objects you find, take a break, come back to the game, and if you find you get to the end, you'll feel tremendously satisfied about the breakthroughs you've made. When you reach a point in Spire where you are in a sort of elevator command center with some crystals in front of you, I do recommend consulting on online hint guide about what to do next; the result is intuitive but I think you will, like me, waste several hours unsuccessfully trying to make it click.  I am really happy to see the entire Myst series under Cyan Worlds' ownership and published on Steam for people to play. I had a great time playing the game, although again I do feel it is the weakest of the first four games, I'm confident if you've played the series this far it is worthwhile for you to continue with Myst 4, and I hope you enjoy the game if you do.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/vivysworld/recommended/409710,1, &quot;No Gods Or Kings, Only Man&quot;. One of my favourite game. - Review for Bioshock - 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/432370,1, I'd offer a weak recommendation to Sethian: if you read the game's premise and it's interesting to you, I'm confident you will get something out of the game. But the execution is something less than the premise.  The pitch of the game is that you are a xeno-linguist who has landed on an alien planet and is interacting with a computer system guarding the planet. Unfortunately, both the input keyboard and the responses the computer gives are in the Sethian language. The idea is that by using some basic clues and asking questions, you can eventually learn something about the structure and words of the language and make sense of the planet you're on. You're presented a computer with 100 symbols for words and a handful of punctuation symbols, and initially at least it feels like you're going to have a pretty meaty game with lots of exploration. You take out some sheets of paper to take notes so you can get the hang of the language.  Where the game fails to live up to its premise is that after a few simple questions about the language, you're essentially granted a half-complete dictionary, and those words that are not included are not part of the game. So the 100-odd symbols you see are actually perhaps 20-odd symbols in total. And shortly after this, you learn about a particular event in Sethian's history, at which point your character is only interested in this event and the computer is only willing to talk about the event. I think this is a problem because although this is clever and interesting, you're left wanting to know more about the language you're using and the events that have taken place in the world.  Compounding this problem, your character writes his (or her) thoughts in a journal, but this journal includes the character's interpretations of the computer's answers and thoughts about what to ask next. So for the bulk of the game's runtime, you're literally just inputting what the journal tells you to input and then reading the computer's response in the journal.  After a while you get to the game's first ending. The ending is clearly a &quot;bad&quot; ending, and it's implied there's more you can do. If you embark down the path to the second ending, the journal stops updating, and so you're expected to get things right on your own. This is something closer to the promise the game offers, but this segment of the game is a few short questions where the computer bombards you with words whose meanings you don't know. But the computer is very rigid in both how it expects you to ask questions and what it is willing to answer, so mostly you're fumbling until you get the exact right question to advance linearly. The second ending is more upbeat.  I read all the Steam discussions and guides surrounding the game and external posts on other websites to get a sense of whether other players got more meaning out of Sethian than I did. The answer is... sort of. People are clearly asking questions and interpreting things, but there isn't much there to go on. So I checked the Kickstarter for the game, and it strikes me that what was promised was something a bit larger in scope than what was delivered. The author put a lot of thought into why the language would have the symbols it does, but then doesn't use half of them. Also, I decided to dive through the file structure of the game to see if there was any hidden content -- I was surprised to find out that the game is essentially a series of jpgs, numbered linearly. Knowing that the content was stored this way internally made it clear to me that there isn't a hidden layer to the game beyond what I'd seen. I think maybe this is a case where the developer's ambition (to combine his learning of Chinese, interest in linguistics, interest in old mathematics and philosophy, and desire to develop a game) outstripped his ability (developing a more flexible parser, producing enough content, world design for a broader world).  This review sounds pretty negative, so let me wrap up by saying: If you're interested in a game about learning an alien language and using that language to uncover clues about the alien civilization, Sethian is an interesting and worthwhile stab at that. But I think if you're really interested in the premise, in the end you'll wish there was more.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/288160,1, The Room (note: not based on the films The Room or Room!) is a point and click puzzle game that will be familiar to anyone who has played a room escape video game or done a live action room escape. You are in the haunted attic of a mansion and you find an elaborate and ornate box. By flipping levers and dials, pressing buttons, putting keys in locks, and generally fiddling you slowly open more and more of the box and learn about the secret of the room. The plot is mostly flavour and mood rather than a concrete narrative. Puzzles are fun and generally fair. The game looks gorgeous. At 2-3 hours, I think the game is priced appropriately.  I want to emphasize two things for people considering the game: First, the built-in hint system is excellent. Automatically after fiddling around for a while, if you're not making progress, the game will help you by giving you a hint prompt. Click on it and you'll progressively get more information. In this way you never feel stuck or under pressure. If you're getting frustrated, take a hint. If not, that's okay too.  Second, while the visuals on the PC version are excellent, the controls remain optimized for touch platforms. The game is very tactile, lots of dragging and rotating and moving things. Although this is replicated here via mouse controls, I think it's probably a little more playable on a tablet for that reason. I beat the game on iPad a few years ago and replayed here. I believe the game is generally cheaper on tablets as well. So if you're a big Steam collector, prefer playing everything on PC, or just want to support the devs, by all means buy this, but if you're considering both the tablet version and this version. I'd go iPad first.  Looking forward to the third installment being released on Steam.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/595520,1, As a port of 2006 game, I think it's important to answer two major questions: First, is this a good port? Second, is this a good game?  To the first question, yes. This is an excellent port. It runs well, it looks great, and the additions to The Zodiac Age really improve the general playability of the game. If you want to play this game, this is absolutely the version you want to play. In particular, the game speed multiplier is extremely useful for traversing some of the larger maps in the game, and for handling low level combat quickly. I 100% completed the game at about 91 hours, but it never dragged because of the tools I had to make the most of my time. I did run into a bug involving the FMV cutscenes which I solved by running the game in compatibility mode.  To the second question, I think so, yes. If you've never played a Final Fantasy game, this is quite different from the average installment of the series. The best way to think of the game is something like an offline MMORPG game with tools to help you automate combat. If you like programming, you'll find a lot to like here -- if not, don't worry, it's not difficult to learn how to automate things effectively.  For people coming from other Final Fantasy games, this might be a bit of a shock mechanically. But if you engage with the game for what it is, then it's an excellent execution. It is lengthy and engaging, sometimes challenging, has tons of extra content post-completion. The characters, plot, writing, and visual design all feel distinct from the post-7 Final Fantasy games by virtue of taking inspiration less from Japan and anime, and more from European fantasy. The scope of the world is far more enormous than any other game in the series, and for me a lot of the appeal was just going to the next area to see the visual and map design.  The game is routinely 50% off during sales, so you may want to wait for a sale event to buy it, but this is a very strong recommendation for me. If you've never played Final Fantasy 12, you should, and if you'd like to replay the game, this version is the one to get. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/925930,1, I write this review for people who have already played Myst and Riven and want to know whether to continue playing the series. If you have not played these two games, I suggest you begin with RealMyst Masterpiece Edition and go on from there (maybe buy the Cyan Complete Pack if they update that to include Myst 3 and 4.). I have light spoilers recapping elements from the first two games below.  For everyone else, I think a good review of this game should answer two questions for you: 1) Is this game worth playing if you're a fan of the series? 2) Is the port / release of the game good? (The answers to those questions below the break)  To the first question, yes, I believe Myst 3 is worth playing if you're a fan of the series. I grew up playing Myst and Riven and had dabbled with Myst 3: Exile in the past, but never completed it. On the whole I think this is an inspired spiritual sequel to Myst and Riven. I say spiritual sequel because besides the obvious difference that the game was not developed by Cyan Worlds, the plot takes place in a sort of between-space where events and characters from Myst/Riven are mentioned but in general all the events of this game have no real bearing on Myst 4 or 5. The game involves a character called Saavedro, trapped by Sirrus and Achenar, the villains of Myst, in the age of J'nanin (also the game's hub world). This character manages to escape and steals an important linking book from Atrus. The game consists of a hub world, three ages, and a final puzzle which takes place in a self-contained age.  The game's strength is that like Myst and Riven it has exceptionally good visual design (I have posted a few dozen screenshots if you want to check) and solid, challenging but not impossible puzzles. If there's a weakness, it's that to me the three main puzzle ages do not feel like cohesive world, written so that characters could visit or live in them. There is a plot reason for this: the ages were written by Atrus as &quot;tutorials&quot; to explain how to build a world to his sons. But this gives them a sort of weird, artificial quality where it is unclear why they are assembled the way they are or what a visitor might hope to get from them. Something I love about Myst and Riven is how the puzzles feel organic and integrated into the world, but the world still feels livable, and I didn't find that here.  The game's final climax makes use of a puzzle that I found interesting. It is easy but fun if you understand what makes it tick, but maddening if you don't make the logical leap to figure out how it works. As with every Myst game, take notes, read the journals you find, and listen to the voice acting. It is easy to miss things. I took around 7 pages of notes. Although I hadn't taken notes that were used specifically in the final puzzle, my memory of certain clues found earlier did prompt me to understand the puzzle. I may have benefitted from playing the game in 3-4 marathon sessions over a few day period. I remembered virtually nothing from the game from my previous attempt to play it 15 years ago, and the 7.4 hours it took me is the amount of time it took to finish the game and view the alternate &quot;bad&quot; endings. In general, I would say this game is less difficult than Myst and Riven, but not necessarily easy.  I want to make special note of the game's score. The first two games, scored by Robyn Miller, used ambient, natural music. Here, Jack Wall does soaring and often eastern-sounding score. It's a different approach. I like Miller's version more, but Wall is still a very talented composer.  In terms of whether this is a good port -- it is a good but bare bones port. The game works on my computer without a hitch. Everything visually looked good and not stretched or janky. There is obviously some clash between the FMVs and the pre-rendered backgrounds, but in general I thought everything looked great. Navigation was quick and easy, and I didn't run into any timing issues that sometimes plague running old games on modern machines. Cyan worked with the crew at ResidualVM (a 3d spinoff of ScummVM) to make sure the ResidualVM engine fully supports the game's content. There are at the time of my writing no achievements, trading cards, or support for anything fancy, and the visuals definitely showed some age. But I don't think this should discourage anyone from buying the port.  As with any Myst game, good luck solving the puzzles and please try to resist the modern urge to immediately seek a hint. Walk around, play with objects you find, take a break, come back to the game, and if you find you get to the end, you'll feel tremendously satisfied about the breakthroughs you've made.  I am really happy to see the entire Myst series under Cyan Worlds' ownership and published on Steam for people to play. I had a great time playing the game, and although it did not make as strong of an impression as Myst and Riven did, I'm confident that if you liked those two games, you'll like this one. I offer an enthusiastic recommendation and I hope that you enjoy the game.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/425580,1, The Room Two (note: not based on the films The Room or Room!) is a point and click puzzle game that will be familiar to anyone who has played a room escape video game or done a live action room escape. If you've never played the original game The Room, you should go buy and play that instead of looking at this one. For the rest of the review, I assume that readers have played The Room.  In contrast to the Room where you were unpacking an elaborate toy box, piece by piece, the Room Two is something closer to a traditional room escape. Scenes contain multiple benches, stations, or objects you can interact with, and keys or buttons from one can be used to activate things in another. You start with a room where everything is locked off, and slowly you managed to wiggle into all the various items and stations. I'm not sure that I liked this better than the Room because I felt like I spent more time going from place to place, orienting myself instead of actually solving puzzles.  The game is slightly longer than The Room, maybe 30-45 minutes longer, and definitely bigger budget with more interactivity and more going on. The story layer is also slightly thicker, but still mostly just about setting a mood rather than a narrative or characters you'll care about.  As with the Room, the game has an excellent hint system which helps keep the pace up by allowing you to make progress if you feel jammed. I recommend using hints if you feel stuck. My one complaint about the hints is that sometimes hints seem to emphasize bits you've already figured out, forcing you to wait to actually get a hint for what to do now.  As with the first PC port, the visuals here are great but there are occasionally moments where I felt I would have rather played with touch controls. I did not beat this game on iPad, so I'd be open to feedback as to whether the tablet version is better or worse. I still very much enjoyed this game on PC, I just get the sense that some stuff was built to be touch-first and may have been smoother there.  Looking forward to the third installment being released on Steam, hopefully in 2017! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/208110,-1, First, I just wanted to say that I am a great fan of the Myst series and if you have not played Myst through Myst IV, you should start with realMyst Masterpiece Edition. I entirely recommend the games up until this point and nothing I'm about to say should be taken to be criticism of the series as a whole. Below I discuss elements from the previous Myst games.  I can't recommend Myst V because I do not think it is a good sequel to the series, and because I don't think on its own there is much to recommend. The game is shorter, slighter, easier, and less interactive than any of the previous games, and despite being position as an &quot;end&quot; to the Myst storyline, does very little to engage with other titles in the series.  The premise is simple: Much time has passed since Myst IV. You (I am made to understand that the player character here differs from the previous games, but this is irrelevant and the game is unclear about this) arrive in K'veer, Atrus' study area seen in previous games. You quickly meet a much older Yeesha, Atrus' daughter. She is crazy, delivers a long monologue, and then warps you to the old, dead D'ni age. There, you immediately meet a guy named Esher, who is a D'ni. He tells you not to trust Yeesha and then delivers a long, crazy sounding monologue. You now need to visit a series of ages to get tablets to get some dongle (called a Tablet, but not the tablets you've been using the whole game). Yeesha tells you not to give the dongle to her. Esher tells you not give the dongle to her, and also to give it to him, because it will grant him infinite power. It's all a little on the nose. There is nothing resembling a plot for the rest of the game, and then in the ending you choose what to do with the dongle. Other than a passing reference and Yeesha's existence, the game does not connect to Riven, Myst 3, or Myst 4. I am told the game connects more to Uru, which I have not played.  The previous games sketched out their story, history, and worlds through diaries. Here, we find 12 of Yeesha's diaries in the caverns leading to D'ni. What does she have to say? Not really anything, it's mostly just nutcase rambling and mythology dump that never comes into play in the game. There is a puzzle solution in one of the journals -- a throwback to earlier Myst games if ever there was one -- but it feels less organic. The other ages contain no items, journals, writing, or really anything to tell you much. Instead, information is conveyed by Esher giving long, boring monologues. The endings discuss these elements as though the player was invested. I was not.  The game is in full 3D. It actually looks remarkably good. The environments are clean and the designs are beautiful as always. I uploaded a few dozen screenshots and I have nothing bad to say about the environmental graphics. The character models are disappointing; low polygon, sub-Half-Life 2 era 3D models with stilted animation. Is it fair to judge the game today when it was made almost 15 years ago? Yes. All of the other games hold up visually in their old way. To put it simply, replacing digital actors with 3D models is a little like George Lucas talking about how the CG in the Phantom Menace is better than the traditional models and animatronics. It's not true, and even a few years removed from the game's release it looks obviously dated. This is compounded by the overall poor direction -- character voice actors deliver bland line readings as they pace back and forth in place. You can't skip text or move around during it. Just an epic disappointment, really. There was one character model which, to talk about it would be a spoiler, but my heart literally sank in my stomach when I saw it. As a long term fan, it's all so sad.  The choice to go 3D impacts everything else as well. The node-based navigation is an unfun afterthought, but 3D movement is not much better. The character's walking speed is too slow, the running speed is too fast, and the physics are off so going down stairs too quickly makes you mysteriously float. The developers compensate for this by making passages wide and open, which then gives the world an emptier feeling.  I am not sure if the choice to go 3D impacted the puzzle design, but I can tell you that there is little puzzle design. Virtually every puzzle in the game revolves around either finding a hidden switch, or finding a symbol written in the wall and regurgitating it in the right place. There are easily fewer than 10 real puzzles in the game. It's really too bad. When the game started and I got the opportunity to explore the caverns leading down to D'ni, I was extremely excited... until I got to the bottom and there was nothing there and not even really any puzzles.  As far as I can tell, the design effort went to adding a tablet mechanic. You carry a tablet on which you can draw, using your mouse, symbols. If you then put the tablet on the ground and walk away, an alien friend will teleport in, look at the tablet, and if he understands the symbol, do something. The game is built around this and it's a deeply bad mechanic. I understand what they wanted to achieve -- take the notion of writing and language that is so important to the series and put them in direct control of the player. But it is a failed execution on several levels. First, the symbol detection is awful. At the end of the first age, a puzzle requires you to draw a symbol. My first time through it took me 14 tries to draw the symbol correctly and I could not tell you what I did differently when it eventually worked. In the next age, I drew a symbol thinking it would be a puzzle solution -- unfortunately the game interpreted the symbol incorrectly and promptly made me skip the entire age. It was impossible to undo this decision, meaning I had to replay a decent chunk of the game to restore from an earlier save. Let's imagine that the writing recognition worked. Would this be a good mechanic? No. Largely writing is inconvenient, carrying the tablet around and dropping it when you need to climb ladders feels awful, it takes up a non-trivial portion of your viewport making it harder to enjoy the world design. The symbols themselves do almost nothing. Each age has one symbol that does something to the age's climate. You use it once or twice in appropriate places. Each age has 3-4 symbols which warp the tablet to a pedestal somewhere in the age. These are generally used in a boring way. There are two special symbols that are a part of solving puzzles (at least the way I solved them). And... that's the ballgame. You never need to apply knowledge from other ages. I took a total of two pages of notes, most of them symbols to write on the slate -- in general Myst games take 6-10 pages of notes.  Although you can do the ages in any order, the game has an intended order. At the end of one age, dialogue makes it clear this is supposed to be the first age. At the end of another, dialogue makes it clear that this is supposed to be the second age. And at the end of what it assumes is the fourth age, you get a bunch of pre-ending dialogue. Hope you didn't pick the wrong order, otherwise this dialogue would seem like random nonsense. Oops.  The music goes for more an ambient vibe, like Myst and Riven, then the Jack Wall scores from 3 and 4. I prefer ambient music, but found the music here bland and could not hum or tell you anything about the music.  There is an element in the game's bad endings that is an interesting and heartbreaking callback to the series as a whole. If you look it up online, you'll see what it is. Seeing something you love in ruins is really a metaphor for this game.   For anyone reading, play realMyst, Riven, Myst 3, and Myst 4 instead. If you finish those, I would move onto Obduction, Cyan Worlds' recent game, which looks and plays great and is a worthy followup. If instead you play Myst V, I hope you don't let it tarnish your memories of the past.

Hope developers who worked their hearts out on this game for many years and from what I can tell produced a great game recognize that their publisher is actively working against their interests by making design decisions that substantially hurt their word of mouth.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer¡¯s head. There¡¯s also Rick¡¯s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance.

As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn¡¯t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick¡¯s existential catchphrase ¡°Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,¡± which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev¡¯s Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Hinahou/recommended/488300,1, Great realistic Skate style snowboarding game. Like if Shaun White Snowboarding had been done right. Really enjoyable game to just chill on with some music.  Pros: - Precise controls. - World building - means a great variety of features to play on. - Best rails/jobs in any snowboarding game. These are a bit magnetic, but I've found no real issues with them unlike some other snowboarding games. - Story is challenging. - Trick points award style, and not just spin to win. This makes the game a lot more fun as you can tweak out various grabs rather than trying to do a 1980 quad cork all the time.  Cons: - Low amount of customisation options sadly. Devs have addressed the reasons why. I would love to see them expanded on in the future, either in this game or another. - Controls can be a bit fiddly at times, I¡¯ve a few issues with trying to land a certain trick and doing a small variety of similar tricks instead as the controls are very close. Also ollies can be weird sometimes. - I¡¯ve had a few issues with the game not recognising tricks that have been landed, or miss-counting rotations. This is very frustrating for some of the story mode challenges. -  No Tree taps! I wish I was allowed to bonk and tap trees with my board as part of a trick.  Overall this is definitely the best ¡°realistic style¡± snowboarding game out there.  A lot of challenge here to keep you entertained for hours and get you hyped to go ride.

If you played the old one on PS2 a little has changed with regards to the licences, I would advise maybe looking some stuff only as they've now gone with more of a traditional Final Fantasy style job system with these boards.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/zoburg/recommended/219150,1, This game is a master piece, the story is excellent and in my opinion is setup like the SAW series or sin city, nothing makes sense until the end, some levels can be tricky but nothing you can't beat with a few retries  SPOILERS (DUH)     You(the person playing the game, not the protagonist) are the bad guy in the end, you only killed people because you were told to, the 2 janitors you kill at the end are the developers, when you ask them a question they are talking to you, you can't win after you kill 1 person, the game wins, killing the janitors in the end is admitting defeat to the game, although it's too late to realise it     DO NOT CLICK LINK AS IT CONTAINS SPOILERS   LINK   [www.gamasutra.com]

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zazecki98/recommended/237870,1, Writing as of a0.9 This is definitely an early access game. It is nowhere near completion, but is definitly worth keeping an eye on. It may cost a bit much for what it is currently, but if it keeps getting updated and the developers put time into it, it could be an amazing game. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/slavkina56/recommended/203160,1, Beautifull graphics, nice game mechanics and great story with lots of plot twists. A must have if you like adventure games

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zazecki98/recommended/535230,1, It's a fun game, but it has a very similar problem to xcom. You build up a few core gladiators that can crush most things, except it's most often just one or two instead of 4~6. I can recommend it, but not in long term, as some of it's quirks get old, and it runs out of stuff once your god gladiator dies to fair fight as if he was lv1  Like xcom, you can't bail very easily in fights. If the terms aren't good, you can bail, but you can't afford to miss fights in this game. Also, unlike xcom, because you only have a 2 good fighters, you just can't recover when one dies. Which will happen, because the game likes to throw comparatively godlike entities into normal matches on occasion. Also, the level of oppenents seems to be heavily affected by your best fighter. So if you don't very precisely balance your fights early, you'll lose your best man.   A simple fix to this problem is to mix in weak fights and make it so that fighters gain experience proportionate to the skills of there oppenent. If little lv10 billy beats lv35 bloodthirster, he suddenly rockets up to lv30. If lv100 Humungo beats lv25 Johnny boy, he gets to be lv101. That way, you aren't supposed to through your god into every fight, over cook him, and then lose him right before the end of the game

Just imagine Counter-Strike with additional tools such as a spade, to make shelters, trenches and dig tunnels. And the blocks to build. It is impossible to predict points of campers, and the movement of the enemy. Lots of maps and modes for the game. A variety of weapons. Also, you can create a skins for weapons and the skin of the character! Highly recommend this game!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/seneca97/recommended/224540,1, A pretty enjoyable game. I'm personally not a great fan of the map editor, but the game modes are awesome, especially the zombie mode!  
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197966755710/recommended/241540,1, Bought this yesterday for the 50% off along with the DLC.  Good graphics, zombies have actually made me jump once in awhile when they sneak up on me.  IMO one of the best zombie survival games.  The main story is good with lots of things to do.  Been trying to play the DLC 'breakdown', its HARD!  With the 'one life to live' feature, i have getting my people killed off to fast and having to start over. :D ITS GREAT!  A lot harder to be quiet and not use the guns, which make a lot of noise.  Normal state of decay has a story line that you follow to the end, with the breakdown, more open world, no real story line that ive seen. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/DyaBuza/recommended/218640,1,  You have no friends! Everyone must die!     You are the son of Lucifer. You must to kill to get new strength.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/seneca97/recommended/32440,1, I played the first part a lot in my childhood and later on also the second part and The Complete Saga. The first part even introduced me to Star Wars, because back then I had only watched the Phantom Menace. These LEGO games are still my favourite, because I'm a big Star Wars fan, but also because they are so basic. Although I prefer the first LEGO Star Wars, I still enjoy playing this one, it has some nice extra levels and extra characters, However you can't do much in the cantina, I miss the huge fights I had in Dexter's diner and Mos Eisley's cantina from part 2. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197966755710/recommended/332500,1, I play a lot of sand box survival games.  This one is much like the others, as far as the normal grind goes.  Harvest resources, build stuff, kill stuff.    -What sets this one aside from the rest is one big item, that i like.  You can place a beacon, respawn point, mostly where ever you want.  At your house, dungeon entrance, around the world.   -The super large worlds are very nice as well.  Running around and not hitting the edge of the map is SO refreshing. -Graphics are, for me, good.  Runs good with the odd hickup of lag now and then, but not a big issue. -Virtually no extra loading, once the game is loaded.    A few things that could be changed, in my openion. -The ability to quick change jobs.  So annoying to have to enter inventory screen, then jobs, then tell it YES i want to change my job.  To take advantage of the benefits of that job easier.  *(UPDATE) Thanks to SRazor for explaining the level/job system to me.  Was a big help. (see below in comments)   -When leveling, you have your main level and then your job level.  Your main level should not increase if your job level is lower then your main.  Makes it harder to level my job up when my main level is really high.   *(UPDATE) Thanks to SRazor for explaining the level/job system to me.  Was a big help. (see below in comments)   -Some of the tutorial quests are not as clear as they could be.  For example it tells you to use a skill, took me quite sometime to figure out just how to use a skill. -Some more monsters to hunt down.  I have only seen about 3 main types.  Lizard type, bird and turtle type.    I have read some comments about how the devs are not doing anything and the game is dead, i really hope this game is not dead.  It has a lot of potential, that should be taken advantage of.  *(updates) -Found more then the first 3 base type of monsters.  Very nice to see more monsters.  The added touch of making the turtles sound like puppies, FUNNY AS HECK!   -The frog looking monsters are kind of creepy, in a good way.  Always sticking there toung out is funny. -Needs a recall for buggy, ect. that get stuck or vanish. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/seneca97/recommended/260230,1, Great story and atmosphere showing the horrors of The Great War. Also, the puzzles are fun too.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197966755710/recommended/440900,1, I do enjoy this game, from combat to building, but i do have a complaint.  That is that you have no mini map, way to track friends or clan, and you can not make your own local server for lan.  If you are able to figure it out to make a co-op, your tethered to each other.  WTF is that about?  If you want you can, RENT, a server from them for about $2 per slot.  Again, WTF!  We paid for the game, you made it super hard to even start a co-op, and you teather us to one another in a co-op, forcing us to play on your servers (no mods allowed) or someone elses.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/ItzSpicyYo/recommended/232090,1,  Pros:  - Gore - Very well optimized. Runs well on my system - Rarely crashes - Awesome soundtrack - Good graphics - Blood and gore - Each difficulty feels unique and needs to be played differently with your team - SO MUCH GORE - Replayable - Customization - Did I mention the gore? - 10 Perks each having their own playstyle - Workshop   Neutral:  - Leveling can feel slow on some Perks. But it teaches you how to play each Perk by actually spending time with each one   Cons:  - You're reading my review and not killing Zeds on the Killing Floor :C 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/seneca97/recommended/438640,1, This game was suprisingly fun.  Suprisingly because I'm actually not a huge fan of The Force Awakens film,  and because I didn't like the other LEGO games as much as the old LEGO Star Wars games. Also, this is the first LEGO game I completed 100% after the first LEGO Star Wars game. This game has lots of fun sidemissions, is full of humour and introduced some nice new features like blaster battles. However I also encountered some glitches and crashes, and like every LEGO game the keyboard controls make no sense. (I always change it to the keyboard controls from the first LEGO Star Wars game, which were fine) Despite that I really enjoyed this game, enough to complete it 100%, so I definitely recommend it.

While it was a lot of fun while it lasted, you should probably spend your money elsewhere or hopefully, it goes f2p soon.    Pros:  - Very fast-paced - Good soundtrack   - Decent visuals   - Movement is really fun to maneuver around in   - The Blitzball is voiced by Justin Roiland (Rick &amp; Morty VA)   - Gender-neutral toilets   - Kicking people in the face I guess     Cons:  - No one plays anymore

https://steamcommunity.com/id/BottyBotsworth/recommended/367500,1, I have over 200 hours on the PS3 version and plan on going over that with this version. I don't feel like writing a huge review for a game that came out last gen but I will throw my two cents into the ring, which hasn't changed from the PS3/360 version.  Pros + Decently sized world + Interesting classes + Interesting story + Fighting large monsters is fun  Cons - Could have used more cities - Could have had a larger variety of monsters - Would would be better with more random encounters of the bigger monsters such as the gryphons and chimeras  I wont talk about the end game since I never actually played Dark Arisen so I have no experience with it. I've just made 20 or so runs through the original game. I understand Capcom cut a bunch from the game. I really hope it gets a sequel or that we at least get the MMO over here.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/RomRomRya/recommended/335300,1, Can't say this game is any good or bad, nor can I recommend it - this game is beyond awesomeness, and a sane person just can not recommend it - only insist you play it.  This game offers a fabulous pve experience, a great variety of weapons, armor - you name it, tons of possible interesting build options and absolutely amusing pvp experience (the best in souls series for sure).  Recommend? No. I insist you buy it and play it. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zangston/recommended/369200,1, Great soundtrack and good gameplay; it feels lackluster but that can be justified due to the fact that it's in early access. Overall, great game. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/RomRomRya/recommended/105600,1, After all these years I can tell Terraria is one of the best, well done and most entertaining games of its kind out here! I still remember the days when killing skeletron was considered endgame, good days. The devs've made an insane progress since then and only for the best - I couldn't imagine Terraria would turn into such content rich and entertaining sandbox.  Why do I reccomend it? That's why: - Fast paced, stylish (even though very simple) combat - Attractive pixel graphics - Well done character/world progression - Beautiful environment - A lot to explore, every playthrough is somewhat different - Great soundtrack - You can build! And it actually has a purpose! - Every boss is forever in my heart&lt;3 - Customize character looks (very important for me) - Even better with friends - And the last, but not the least - the game doesn't require a NASA computer to play it  10 slimes out of 10 slimes! Will definitely play it again, over and over. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zangston/recommended/22300,1, Still trying to figure out how to shout.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/RomRomRya/recommended/251570,1, I played this since the early alpha and I can say for sure - this game gets better and better with every update. Defend zombie hordes, experiece a real fear for your own house! All this, with simple crafting system, easy, intuitional game mechanics will make you spend infinite hours. This game definitely worths its price.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/BottyBotsworth/recommended/48700,1, This game is BAWLIN' yo. Armiez be fightin' like you never SEEN. I attacked one and I was like &quot;WHAAAAT! Are you serious Vaegirs?&quot; Mean nords workin the maps, tho. This one dude wouldn't even let me siege. I was like &quot;please your towns ?????? anyway.&quot; 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/BottyBotsworth/recommended/230230,1, I bought this thinking it'd be a diablo style loot grabber. I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be fantasy fallout. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/BottyBotsworth/recommended/251990,1, Play as a cute princess girl. Burn your enemies alive with magic. Release a kraken and feed it people to save your kingdom. Die from chocolates.  15/10 - suggest to all my friends even in death. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/BottyBotsworth/recommended/384490,1, Played it for a little bit solo. Was looking for a basic rogue-lite that I could play from time to time when I have a bit of time to kill. I haven't tried co-op yet but that's one of the main reasons I bought this.  I agree with most people right now that the thirty dollar price tag is a bit steep as of right now. Don't go into this expecting to drop hundreds of hours. I can see myself doing twenty or so, maybe more if I get some friends in. I am hoping they add content to it personally. New weapon types would be nice and some bosses. As other have stated, item descriptions need something other than flavour text and codexes dont seem to do anything.  I decided to recomend it simply because I hope this was more of a premature release than &quot;here's our 100% full game, enjoy&quot;. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/BottyBotsworth/recommended/41700,1, To this day this is still one of the most immersive games I have ever played. Is it buggy? Yeah. But where else can I drink 70 bottles of vodka, wander into a den full of mutants, and??????my pants because my vision is suddenly focused on a dude with an inflated head? 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/BottyBotsworth/recommended/236110,1, Loved Dungeon Defenders 1 and so far this one has been better in every regard. My only complaint so far is that it takes so long to hatch an egg and they are filling my inventory.  ~Edit~  It would be cool if the classes had secondary weapons to give them a bit more variety. Such as bringing back the crossbow to the huntress with a faster fire rate than the bow but lower damage per shot or a two handed weapon for the squire forgoing his shield in favor of a charged attack.  The individual construction gems is a nice feature but also a burden when you're playing with pre-constructed teams. A prime example is I often play with a group of my friends and enjoy playing hero spec'd huntress and squire where they enjoy playing tower spec'd monk and apprentice. When we complete a wave I have to go gather up my gems from the chest and drop them for my friends to use since they will have the much stronger buildings. It'd be a nice if I could pass my chest off to the other players automatically splitting the resources among the other players or having a feature for private rooms to allow one person to gather all of the gems from the chest they open.  I would also love an endless mode where you just try to survive an endless amount of waves.  The new tavern is nice and actually feels more like a social place rather than just a hub for in between levels. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198222460728/recommended/218640,1, I found it to be a good game but it was very easy to get lost and not know how to proceed.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198854038620/recommended/218640,1, This game is a little short, but it is awesomd. Evil childern are creepy alome, but now with powers from Satan himself. Awesome Kill scenes and a fantastic story line. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/davetheking/recommended/431960,1, This is a pure masterpiece of program. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/iasonnn/recommended/286320,1, Oknytt is a charming little fella, who doesn't know where he came from, or why, and where he should go next. His goal soon becomes to help an injured fairy get her wings back, and though he is small and defenseless, he lives up to the challenge fearlessly.  The game is inspired by Swedish mythology, which I knew very little about. So it's interesting to say the least! The rune system gives a nice touch, as you can interact with the environment in various ways. The mythological creatures you come across are plenty and there's also a bestiary so you can read more about them. The voice over is excellent, giving the sense that you're reading a fairy tale. The dark palette makes the various locales look dark and ominous.  There are just two problems in my opinion. At times the game feels  too  dark and depressing. I overlooked it mostly, because I assume it's how the designers want to tell their story, but it became a bit tiring after a while. Especially when pixel hunting for clues. The second problem lies in the fact that the puzzles seem too nonsensical and unintuitive, so without a guide I'd be stuck for a very long time. Oh, and a minor one is that Oknytt moves quite slowly and it created a tiny bit of frustration for me.  But despite these problems, I believe that's it's pretty unique game, with a very original theme and backstory.  ?????????? You should give it a try and see for yourself! 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198144601628/recommended/730,1, This game is really awesome 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198144601628/recommended/311210,1, very good game 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/deluxe_fox/recommended/105600,1, One of the best games i've played with friends! I really like it and hosting a server is pretty easy 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/deluxe_fox/recommended/537800,1, Just to start of WOW! This game is awesome. It started with a tuturial, but when i started a mission it was a bit hard to figure out what to do. But it didn't took alot of time and effort to see what you had to do. each crew member has a different role in the plane. and they each have individual abilities. The game is so much fun to play! I would definitely recommend this! :D 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198144601628/recommended/720280,1, I love this game 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/iasonnn/recommended/218640,1, When I got this game I thought: Yay! A devil-spawn version of Hitman! Turns out I was only half-right. Sure, you get to wipe the whole house clean, while trying not to get detected, but with two major differences: Stealth -and the way it's implemented- plays ultimately a minor role, and there's not too much freedom of choice in the murder weapons, if any at all.  So the game feels a bit linear and leads you forward by holding your hand, but it still is so much fun! The Dante manor is magnificent, the people interesting, the music superb and each character's ultimate demise inspired to say the least! There's not too much of a story there, but there is cause and effect to the various events.    And as I was wondering, how the hell do I keep up with all those killings without the detective sniffing me out, things escalate just at the right moment. The ensuing carnage is immensely gratifying!    I don't know if this game was supposed to be serious / somber back in its day, but by today's standards it's quite easy, kinda funny and exceedingly satisfying!   &quot;The power of Christ compels you!&quot;   ?????????? Awesome. You should most probably enjoy it! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/deluxe_fox/recommended/39000,1, This game is pretty good with voices :D 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/iasonnn/recommended/105000,1, So, another point and click adventure where I'm exactly on the fence about. It wasn't an unpleasant experience, but I'm pretty glad it's over.  The premise is good and promising: The world is ending from a climate cataclysm, so future scientists travel back to the present to try and stop the catastrophe at its root. So far so good. The story is original, the overall theme interesting, and the locales well designed, especially the backgrounds.  The problem is that the game is too serious for its own good. The conversations with Fay, the scientist from the future, about the oncoming disaster and humankind's responsibility (or lack therof) are too on the nose, and the urgency they convey feels really forced. Brent, from the present, on the other hand looks utterly defeated from life's burdens and is quite boring to play with. The chemistry between them is, regrettably, non existent.  I don't mean that the game, or any game, should have boxes ticked, about an intriguing story, lovable characters, or witty dialogues, but in the end, there was no joy in playing this one.  I'm ultimately saying (lacking a 'meh' button) yes, give this game a try and make your own decision. Polished point and click adventures are somewhat of a rarity, so we can't be too picky. The progression of the story and the puzzles are good enough, so maybe the game will also be good enough for you. If only it had a bit more charm! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/deluxe_fox/recommended/72850,1, This is one of the games i've played the most out of all of my games. Everytime i come back to this game it reminds me of when the game first came out. Astonishing gameplay! I love it :D 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/iasonnn/recommended/250600,1, Who knew that being a fly could feel so magical? 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/iasonnn/recommended/314020,1, This is a very interesting game, as casual games go. And one of the most colourful ones I've ever played! The art is beautiful, the soundtrack fitting, and though it needs some pixel hunting at times, it's very relaxing, almost soothing. Don't try (or expect) to run or make sudden moves. Just enjoy the tranquility it exudes, and enjoy all the colours! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/iasonnn/recommended/358470,1, The content almost doubles the game length and is just as good. The difficulty curve spikes dangerously compared to the base game, which seems in comparison like child's play! The story continues and is much deeper, bringing a kind of conclusion. You should not pass it by, especially if you enjoyed the first part.  ?????????? Excellent. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/iasonnn/recommended/257510,1, Great concept, great implementation. Some of the later puzzles are extremely hard, but there are no &quot;awkward&quot; solutions, everything makes sense in a way. You just don't see it at first... The final (timed) sequence can be frustrating at times but it was, in general, very well crafted. The world hubs are very beautiful (especially the Egypt-inspired one) and the philosophy imbued in the game quite thought provoking.  ?????????? Awesome game, highly recommended! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/iasonnn/recommended/328270,1, I don't usually play and/or enjoy visual novels, but Leviathan was unexpectedly fun and enjoyable! The biggest asset in my opinion is the story and lore which seem rich, colourful, and extremely well thought of. The same goes for the characters, each of whom exhibits discernible traits and characteristics, with complex personalities.  A bit of the adventure genre is thrown in the mix, as you have an inventory with quite a few items to manage. A fact that enhances the sense of your character being real, one who interacts with his environment actively, and is not just passing through like a viewer.  There are also options presented to you in some situtations, which you'll have to make decisions for. They are more like ethical dilemmas, which may seem (and be) ineffectual, but they may be coming back to bite you in the future!  I can't stress enough how beautiful the inception of the world of Leviathan is. The world itself is far from an idyllic utopia; it has its flaws, its dangers, and its difficulties. But that is, ultimately, what it makes it feel complete, fully fledged and ready to be explored. Go already! :D 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Iskander2/recommended/844930,1, A great an interesting story, I would gladly reccomend this game if you're into story telling games. This game will last you around 2 and a half hours, maybe 2. The background and badges are pretty good but I don't understand why there is a sexual/nudity tag as I didn't see anything nudity related. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Iskander2/recommended/720280,1, This is a pretty good story game. This was a very interesting but emotional story. The music and the animations were really good as well. After completing this game I would reccomend their new game Fox Hime Zero. This one is emotinal in its on way as well. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/iasonnn/recommended/364230,1, To be honest, I don't know how much value the game has as a stand-alone title. I mean that I played the original version first, and I kinda consider this a DLC to it, where I breezed through the game just for kicks!  Storywise it is identical to the original. The only difference is, obviously, its presentation. Curiously, it plays perfectly in this form too, if not even better. (I had some framerate issues with the original, this one was smooth sailing all the way). The pixel graphics in fact give to the game a very endearing charm. The 8-bit music is also very well crafted.  My favourite part was the death scenes, where the music became grander, the screen zoomed in, and I was anxiously waiting for the final, full-screen close up!  ?????????? Awesome. Could it even be a bit better than the original? ? 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198176223977/recommended/105600,1, Still one of the must-have PC games. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/iasonnn/recommended/511470,1, This is an extremely elegant game. The Art Deco clocks are beautiful, and working with the pieces feels like a delicate procedure. The music is fitting, complementing the casual pace and the reflective mood of the game.  My problem is that I had bigger expectations from it. Maybe it's mainly my fault, because I had this idea stuck in my head that I was playing a Pandora's Box kind of game. While the completed clocks are pretty, working with the stained glass pieces is a bit tiresome, if not outright monotonous. Having no idea of what the final picture will look like, it feels a bit like working in the dark. You may have some luck with the edge pieces, but after that, and at least up to 50% of the puzzle, it's mostly trial and error. And as the colour palette and tint are similiar it seems you're working with the same pieces over and over again. Maybe if I was playing on a tablet, sitting comfortably on a couch, embracing the casual character of the game, I would have much more fun with it.  Nevertheless, I can't  not  applaud the creators for this beautiful, well-crafted game. You should try it out yourselves and see if it's ultimately worth it or not.  ?????????? Quite Good 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198176223977/recommended/211820,-1, I found Starbound to be more fun before the full release, before even the combat update. At this point I can't really recommend it. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198176223977/recommended/221910,1, This game is a masterpiece.  It will always be one of my favourite games of all time.  There is just something about it that will make you love it no matter what. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/zathanzb/recommended/720280,-1,   I'm Not One For BItter Sweet Stories | An Un-Biased and Fair Review | Spoiler Free!  I like the two visual novels. Fox HIme and Fox Hime Zero, but to be honest Fox Hime is mediocre at best. Zero fixes many things that the this doesn't have so it's better, but it just adds more bitterness to my opinion of this story. The CG's are wonderful, but the in game sprites are a bit off and the sentences don't make sense at times. I mean that is up to artistic interperetation as someone sees art different from another, but it does seem a bit funny visually and linguistically. All that critique aside, the story really leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. Again, this is just personal opinion. But when I come to a VN looking for CASUAL, and CUTE, and SEXUAL CONTENT, I am coming for a romance VN that gives me the warm and fuzzies, but this story just doesn't quite do that. Sure happy ending, but it's REALLY bitter sweet. This ending then left me hoping, maybe Fox HIme Zero will fix it! IT DOESN'T. It just makes this ending more sad than I orignally thought it was.  All in all the series was a dissapointment, I was clickbaited with cute, sexual content, and low prices and that usually translates to &quot;Hey! a quick cheesy romance to read!&quot; But it ends up being none of that. Sure it's romancy and sweet but after the story hits the climax it ends up just rushing the story, love, and character development all the way to the dissapointing ending. I was let down, and Zero just set me up for more dissapointment. If you are in it for Cute Anime Girls, and A Feel Good Romance, then DO NOT GET THIS GAME. You're better off just looking up the cg's online if you really want to. It's honestly the only good thing about this entire series.       2 out of 10 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/zathanzb/recommended/391540,1, Now you may be wondering, why the heck would this random guy make a review on an over played game? Well, I like it, and on top of that I get an achievment for it in the steam badges, so hey! Two birds with one stone.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/HaitianVacation/recommended/364360,-1, Nothing but a paid DLC platform.  Developer officially dropped support less than 1 year after launch. All sorts of errors and bugs they refuse to address. Only pushed out paid DLC patches. Forced paid DLC whether you buy it or not in your game with no ability to disable it. Completely imbalanced units and factions part of paid DLC to encourage players to buy it so they can use it as well.  False modding support. Modding is severly limited to adjust predefined values. Cannot mod basic things on models such as transparency thus no custom models what so ever. You can barely recolor models.  DirectX12 support is still beta. It will never leave beta. Unit shadows have been completely bugged out and won't display unless you view them from a very limited viewing angle which makes the game look awful. CA refuses to address it dodging players that bring it up. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/schweinske/recommended/218620,1, Sehr gutes Spiel!  Es gibt f¨¹r jeden was. Es gibt z.B schleich-missionen in denen die Cops einen nicht erwischen d¨¹rfen, oder auch laute missionen in welchen man versuchen muss zu ¨¹berleben und dabei die Mission noch vollenden. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/5hreddy/recommended/292730,1, I can't speak for the multiplayer, as I haven't really played it much, but personally I think the campaign mode was one of the best in recent installments. The new setting with added weapon types and space battles kept the gameplay fresh whilst the characters and story were a cut above that of Ghosts and AW. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/HaitianVacation/recommended/375230,-1, Typical pay-2-win game.  Leveling = stat increases.  Gear = stat increases.  Free-2-play = being non competitive fodder for players that pay.  Super grindy to encourage players to buy and buy micro transactions.  Visual customization very limited and poorly done.   If you're looking for any enjoyable game this isn't it. If you're looking for a competitive multiplayer this game isn't it. If you're looking to have huge advantages over other players via spending money this game is for you.   Games looks like something from the PlayStation 2 but it also runs poorly. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/HaitianVacation/recommended/311290,1, The biggest attraction of this game is that it¡¯s made for the PC and not just some multi platform paid DLC by the numbers modern game. That is instantly apparent when you load it up. This game launched without a ridiculous season pass or any mention of paid DLC. There is no horrid crafting that now plagues seemingly every game in existence. This game is like a time capsule when games were made by gamers and everything wasn¡¯t designed for paste eating illiterate console gamers. The UI is stylish and uses the whole screen. You actually get an inventory and sorting features and you don¡¯t have to click 15 times to bring up a comparison between gear.   There are no nerdy data logs sitting everywhere explaining the lore of how elves take a dump in the woods. There are things you can read if you want but these are interesting or relevant to where they are such as a note from a dead person next to their corpse. It¡¯s not some primer on the organization of the ruling council of the nerd kingdom you¡¯ll never come across in the game. This brings up one of the greatest strengths on this game as it doesn¡¯t try to overwhelm you with nerd lore. Dialogue makes sense and isn¡¯t boring nerd explanations. This is made even better by the excellent voice acting in which you won¡¯t be cringing over even if the character is swearing. Did I mention that The White Wolf himself is one of the main character voice? That doesn¡¯t hurt either.   I like this game. It reminds me of the good old days of PC gaming where everything wasn¡¯t designed around trying to limit players to spend more money. I don¡¯t feel the need to rush through the game or overthink the mechanics of the game. I can load it up, feel like I¡¯m in a fantasy world, and care about the story because your not trying to do 15 different fetch quests to get 10 pig butts in order to craft a shield.   Good old PC RPG game. There is loot. No tedious crafting. Numerous different enemies based around traditional fantasy tropes.  When you buy and sell things at a merchant the UI is simple and straight forward. You can compare items easily and there is only one currency. The game isn¡¯t a pretentious nerd fest is what I¡¯m saying. If you like fantasy RPG games you¡¯ll probably like this. The RTS elements isn¡¯t the main focus of the game and the campaign doesn¡¯t just plop you on maps to destroy the other side to proceed to the next map. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/5hreddy/recommended/345350,1, This is definitely the best of the FF13 trilogy. It introduces lots of interesting mechanics in terms of the battle system, the Last Ones and the time-based missions.   If you liked the previous two games, then this a good one to pick up. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/5hreddy/recommended/457490,-1, I really wanted to like this VN as the core themes it touches on aren't told very often, but the plot just didn't work me. Though it started strongly, it kind of petered out and didn't really go anywhere interesting, plus the plot twists were just way too cheesy.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/5hreddy/recommended/788770,1, I kissed a poodle, then killed a bulldog before the poodle and the bulldog could be together. That's what type of game this is. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/zombiecat1/recommended/480490,1, First off, I have to praise this game for using quick save feature and not some crappy checkpoint system, this alone has made my game experience quite a bit better than most games using the checkpoint system. Secondly, you can choose which stories to explore and how long you actually want to play. The interesting recycling mechanic to gather raw materials and change it into basic things like ammo or quest items was a pretty welcome change from just being handed everything.  The weapons are very fun to use, wrench is undoubtedly the best in the game, 2nd best being the pistol and the stun gun being the 3rd with its ability to incapcitate (most) foes. Although there aren't just weapons to use as you will eventually be able to use alien abilities to help you defeat enemies either through deception..speed or energy attacks.  You should be aware this game has denuvo, however that never affected me in any of my 40 hours of gameplay. The only thing that affected me was stuttering that used to happen as i suspect a memory leak when the game has been open too long..this was easily solved by just quicksaving then restarting the game..im hoping this will get fixed in a future patch.  The combat is very interesting, as most times there is a way to sneak past your foes or simply outmanuveur them when investing in the mobility tree or just fight them head on, whichever style you pick will work. Which brings me to the upgrade system, you use neuromods to give yourself a flat damage, hp or more inventory space..these neuromods can be found plentifully around the game and eventually crafted.  However, you can also invest the typhoid (alien) abilities which can be very fun and really useful in areas where you might not have access to traditionally with keycards.   I will have to say one thing..fortified turrets are op...have 4 of them bad boys lined up and nothing will make it past..even nightmares get shredded provided you throw a nullifier grenade.  If you are a fan of very good single player games and has plenty of exploration and at your own pace type gameplay...this game is definitely for you. The atmosphere is fantastic and it really gives the feeling of a broken space station that has been mostly void of life besides you and a handful of survivors. The game runs incredibly well on my rig (see profile).  Just 1 more thing, if you do the last mission that involves meeting up with alex yu, it triggers aliens that will block most of the entrances on the map which in turn makes it mostly impossible to carry out non story objectives..just something to think about since i made that mistake and couldnt complete a few side story objectives.  My final thoughts are that this game is definitely one of the best single player experiences I've had in 2017 with alot of content. If you were to do all side story quests you could easily get 40+ hours out of this game which at 30 euros is very good value for money.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/zombiecat1/recommended/359550,1, Extremly well optimised team based tactical shooter. Emphasis on tactical, as this game is very tactics based with many different &quot;operators&quot; that have different skill sets from breaching walls to breaching reinforced walls or having a fragmentation grenade that clears a room to explosives that destroy debris etc.  Its very fun with your friend, but beware the AI is ruthless and unforgiving. Learn the map, learn to use drones to spot enemies before moving in and dont play solo. Its very rewarding after completing a mission. Do not Rush as you will surely die.  *for some reason I had better performance with the ultra HD texture pack, but it may be different for you.  Highly recommended especially as even more content will be added during 2017

https://steamcommunity.com/id/zombiecat1/recommended/379720,1, An amazing FPS with a focus on quick and seamless slaughtering of demons. Its a very satisfying game with an amazing soundtrack to get you into the mood of slaying your demons cause when aren't you in the mood for slaying demons?  Its also very well optimised..I get framerates between 150-200 (GTX 1070) on average..with 200 being the limit. Its smooth and definitely a pc game you should consider picking up as it goes on sale regularly for 15-20 euro.  If your thinking of a good single player campaign game..this game is definitely for you..although there is multiplayer..this game is definitely more focused on delivering a good single player experience and it does whole heartedly.  If you are still are not convinced, mick gordon has the entire doom soundtrack on spotify and youtube..just take a listen and it'll suck you in to the doom universe and before you know it, you'l be wielding a super shotgun and on your merry way blasting demons back to hell..or if your in hell...where?   Anyway, very highly recommended..there is also a free demo to try out if you want to see if your potato can handle the doom game.

So when I found out that One Piece had a game I of coure wanted to play it as soon as possble and this game is a breath of fresh air, it was also pretty fun and the gameplay was pretty good.  However there are a few problems I do in fact have with the game, for starters there is no way for you to memorize the controls of the game because they give you no tutorial for the game so you are complety blind for the game, 2nd the game is a Dyansity Warriors game and I never played a single DW game at all, so One Piece Pirate Warriors 3 is a first timer for me and a game like this can in fact get a bit stale over time, the 3rd thing I should point out is that you should be at Dressrosa before playing or you might be spolled if you play ahead.  The final thing I should point out is that the game has a few differnces from the anime a few examples is that Zora is dressed differntly then he is and barry's are now beils so if small things like that don't suit you then this game may not be your cup of tea.  I recommend this game to One Piece fans and One Piece fans only like myself because if you are not a One Piece fan then you should not play this game because it's just one of those games for the fans, other then that you should 100% play this game if you like One Piece. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/5hreddy/recommended/340170,1, Can't speak about any of issues of the latest Windows patch as I played it prior, but as for the game it was definitely a grower.  I wasn't really feeling it after the first couple of hours as the 30 fps lock and PSP-esque upgraded graphics were not doing a lot for me. But after coming back to it a couple years after first trying it I enjoyed it a lot more. Once you get past some of the issues there's actually quite a fun and diverse combat system with plenty to do alongside a decent story.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198148401542/recommended/584400,1, I have seen many Sonic games in my years most of them were bad and some were decent.  I liked Sonic Unleased for some reason and SG was good, but I soon stopped playing my 360 and I have not played a Sonic game in years, untill one day Sonic Mania came out and boy was this game good.  I have to honesty say this game was a blast to play as it features many of the old classic stages in the Sonic games some from Sonic 1, 2, 3 and CD with 2 new stages in the game.  The controls are pretty good and easy to use after a few mins of play time, the sound track is great and fun to listen to and the graphics give you the old classic Sonic vibe and such.  However there is one problem I do in fact have to say and it's not about Sonic Mania it's self, it's with Sonic Team.  Sonic Forces came out a few months after and it got poor reviews and Sonic Mania was made by fans of the classic games and it got much better reviews like this one, so in other words the Sonic fans can make a better Sonic game than Sonic Team and Sega at that and that is saying something, as a matter of fact that says a lot.  However I recommend this game to anyone who was a fan of Classic Sonic games and for anyone who wants a taste of the classic Sonic games.  Oh and ???? HYDRO CITY.

The game lets you play as 3 characters, Michael a man who wants to retire, Franklin a gangster who wants to live the big life, and Tervor a man who is crazy and is an old friend of Michael who finds out he is alive.  The 3 team up and perform certain missions to fufill their goals and their needs ot to help the FIB to keep them alive and out of trouble, the 3 characters have special abilty's with them, Michael has the abilty which I did not used at all, it can slow down time to get a better aim, Franklin's abilty is that he can slow down time to get a better grip when driving which is very useful when ity comes to racing and driving as a whole, and Trevor's is the one I used the most as he can go into a rage that makes him do double the damage and he can tank more hits.  When you are not doing missions you can come across the many stranges and freaks throughout Los Santos as they have things for you too do and such.  The world if Los Santos is big and there is lots to do in it, you can go biking, buy a boat to ride them, get nice cars and so much more, there is a lot to do in GTYA5 and that is why I like it since the freedom it gives you, hell if you want to go and get the cops on you start a rampage.  Now as for online I have played it a bit on PC but I did manage to play a lot of it at a friends house on his Xbox one and it was good on the there but on the PC is another story as there are a lot of hackers and most of the modding is now gone due to Rock Star and Take Two due to legal actions taken on them.  All in all GTA5 is a great game single player wise and good mutilplayer when the hackers are not out to ruin your fun and such, I recommend this game to anyone who wants a great open world game and the freedom to do what ever they want in the world of GTA5.

It is luck based in a way, the challenge is fair and the weapons from what I here are good.  However games that are like the Binding of Isac to me don't suit me, because of one thing and well that is because of luck and what it gives you.  Should that make you not play the game?  No not in anyway, as I think some people who are reading this review might find the game really fun and I think you should give it a shot.  However if you hate games that have a luck based system then I think Enter The Gungeon is not a game for you, other then that I think you should give it a shot.

Well my friend this game has you crovered and it is one fun expernce to have and it's really fun to play through all of them and when you complete the mission you get to swap charcters and play as them, for example lets say you just beat a mission of Yu Gi Oh vs Seto Kaiba well when you beat it with Yu Gi Oh you get to replay the mission you get to play as Kabia and such.  However there are a few problems I had with the story, the first and formost thing is tag duels are not in the story mode and I don't think they are in mutilplayer at all so the duel between Yugi and Joey vs Pardox Brothers and a few others which sucks, another problem I have with the story and well the game more like it is that some of the duels can be outright BS manily cheating Exodia, that one I had a problem with the most but the rest of the duels are no problem with me, well of course besides luck been in play.  Online is sadly dead but there is a group out there that has people dedacted to play the game so you should find them there.  I recommend this game to anyone who likes the anime, card game, and Manga (which you should read 100% since you get to see all of the uncensored cards and such) of Yu Gi Oh.  Oh and Akize is 10 out of 10 wafiu. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/HaitianVacation/recommended/298900,-1, So I came back and finally &quot;finished&quot; the campaign. Well, I finished it, but the developer didn't. This game was obviously released before it was completed because what happens at the &quot;end&quot; when you complete the last level is absurd and stinks of them literally not completing the game and just releasing it anyway. They put effort into the story in the campaign, but towards the end it abruptly stops. I've never played a game like this where it suddenly just ends without explanation or even credits. This game isn't finished. Numerous bugs such as getting achievements for finding secrets when the game clearly says I didn't find them all in the UI. Where skills for classes that were patched in after official launch have no description so you have no idea what they even do and I'm seeing weapon descriptions not in English, but Spanish......  The graphics and gameplay of this game is fun, but it's not a finished game. The art of the Space Hulk, the weapons, the Terminators, and the enemies are all fantastic. Visuals and atmosphere this game nails perfectly. Apparently they are working on an &quot;enhanced edition&quot; with customization and features that game was designed to have. Who knows when that is coming.   Stay away from this &quot;game&quot;. Even as a huge fan of Warhammer 40,000 I can't recommend this unfinished game unless you can find it under $20 for a sub 10 hour playthrough and forget it. This game had so much promise, but was rushed out with very little content and incomplete.   I still literally can't even about that &quot;ending&quot;.....

I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared reumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Menime_/recommended/462770,1, This game is the third game by Supergiant Games, makers of Bastion and Transistor. This game has fantastic writing and character development outshining both their previous games. I believe it was also the longest of the three games. If you are a fan of story in video games, this is the video game you want to pick up for 20$.   For some positives as I do not want to spoil anything in particular. The world feels real and lived in. Every part of this world is interesting and beautiful. The art design is gorgeous even for Supergiant. Every single character feels like someone, no one is merely a throwaway. Parts of the game even made me start to tear up. the writing is amazing and has that classic Supergiant ending, where the ending can be seen in an equally optimistic or pessimistic light. Most importantly with Supergiant games the soundtrack is consistantly better than their previous titles. After finishing the game I even purchased the soundtrack just to support the development team even further.  For the negatives of the game. There is only one as I see. The gameplay is, in my opinion, significantly worse than both Bastion and Transistor. It is a strategy-esk gameplay style where you manage 3 different characters. While on paper it sounds interesting, in reality it is nothing more than a 3v3 dodgeball/basketball type expereince with slight character variations. Personally I didn't HATE the combat, but compared to that of their previous games it is nothing to praise.   Overall, I highly recommend this game to those people who love story and narrative and are willing to sarifice gameplay for it. If you like any Telltale type game, it's practically that with more gameplay. In case you, Reader, are wondering how overall this stacks up to Supergiant's previous outings, I say this game is slightly worse than Bastion merely because Bastion's gameplay is phenominal, elsewise this game does have better narrative and charatcer in my humble opinion. Meanwhile this game is better than Transistor, because Transistor's falls short in the narrative department heavily and suffers from a combat system that some have called 'clunky'. While I am not saying any of these games are bad or even eh, I love all three of these games and their AMAZING soundtracks, the order in which I would say in quality is Bastion&gt;Pyre&gt;Transistor.   If this review was helpful to your decision to purchase this game I am glad I could be of use. May the Scribes favor you Reader.  Update: I played this game 5 months ago and still have been listening to the soundtrack!

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198148401542/recommended/72850,1, Skyrim, holy??????  Where do I even start?  Well you can pretty much do what ever you want, slay dragons and such but this games main thing is exploring and side questing and that's what makes Skyrim special, you are not playing Skyrim for the story, you are playing it for the adventure and all the stuff you can find and that's what makes Skyrim a great game in it's own right and that is why I think you should buy Skyrim and what ever you do, will not affect the story.  Want to join the Dark Brotherhood?  Go ahead, want to join a college that is full of magic? Go for it, do you want to join the Thevis Guild?  Who will stop you.  The graphics are great and the song that plays when you fight a dragon is badass and it makes it really epic, I like exploring caves, and seeing all of the cites and towns in Skyrim.  However I should give two notes on this review and that is when you start the game doing certain things can be hard so sometimes you have to hold off on certain sidequests and do other missions when you have enough levels, the secoend thing, is that I recommend you use an Xbox controller to play this game as the mouse input is slow and key borad may not help you in some spots but other then that I recommend this game to anyone and everyone.  Play this game you fools!!!!

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198148401542/recommended/49520,1, Borderlands 2 is a game that is better played with friends then on your own because been with your friends is better then been on your won but if you want to play this game on your own you are able to do that.  The story is well done and the characters from the first game are all back and they all have one liners that are to be remembred, There is also a lot of weapons to use in the game and each one has there own twists to them for example bandit weapons carry more ammo and such.  You can also get DLC to play extra missions and unlocks new areas of the game.  I recommend Borderlands 2 for anyone who likes a good shooter and I should add you don't need to play the first game in order to understand the story as they will tell you the events of the first game, other then that I think you should really play this game and grab some friends.

Might be DRM Denuvo's fault, and if so, that's incredibly stupid.   With that aside, the game was alright, definitely superior to the previous games of the franchise (with the exception of AC IV: Black Flag and Rogue). But the story is painfully mediocre and boring, the characters are two-dimensional at best and the progression system just wasn't there.   Combat was really good though, and it felt fast-paced and skillful, which is always welcome from a franchise that was built upon button-mashing fights with the ocasional QTE reflex check. The different weapons all had an unique moveset that set them apart and made them best for its own niche scenario. Still, game felt boring for most of its duration, even if the combat is fun.  I have yet to play the DLCs, but I heard great things about them, so I won't uninstall the game for now.   tl;dr If it wasn't for the performance issues on a rig that should've been more than able to run the game with little to no difficulties on all graphics qualities (especially Low), this game would be quite solid, and I'd even consider getting Odyssey right after. Alas, that is not the case, and I shall not be buying the next installment for fear of performance issues.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198015586815/recommended/214510,1, Very charming game that manages to pick up all of the main points of the films, then adds in some good humour. The levels themselves feel like they're part of the story yet have plenty of hidden things in them, meaning you can keep replaying. Another thing that adds to the replayability is the hubworld having quests and bricks to find, often involving things like jumping challenges or requiring different charecters.   Well worth picking up and goes for a pretty cheap price, and when the main story takes about 12 hours to go through you're getting a lot of bang for your buck.

There are a ton of different playable characters you can unlock in a tree (in the same sense as Rogue Legacy) and stats that can be buffed.

The gameplay is super enjoyable for a jrpg and doesn't??????me off like Final Fantasy 13. The story is pretty good overall. The game basically poslished the concepts of the first two game and fixed all the major problems. The amazing music that follows through the series is back, and also the final boss character is writen very well. I am not going to say who it is, but to be honest you are going to figure it out pretty fast. Finally make sure you go for the true ending it really does matter and it makes the game so much better.   Uni is bae by the way! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Menime_/recommended/359100,-1, Disclaimer: Okay so I didn't finish the game. I am just going to put that out there to start, who knows maybe they threw in some big crazy puzzle near the end but I doubt it. I was roughly at the part where    you return from visiting the aliens and get the infinite placement power.     This game was good I will admit. It looks amazing and the puzzles are not bad, but that's all. I played the first Q. U. B. E. a long, long time ago and this game is just more of the first with a poorly writen story added in between chambers. I can't say the 25 (20 when I bought it)$ price tag is worth roughly 4 hours of gameplay.   I really don't want to say to not get the game but the truth is between the first game and this game the gameplay doesn't stack up to the countless cheaper and better puzzle games that came out since then. Get the first Q.U.B.E., hell just get Portal to be honest, but this game while I was really please to see it came out when I woke up today (I had no clue of its release date prior to today) it just didn't live up to my hopes.  If this game releases dev tools and creates a workshop it will be worth every single dollar but until then this game is just not worth it. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Menime_/recommended/257850,1, Look I could explain to you in depth about how the gameplay is so fluid you always feel as if you are in control of every second. I could say how the artistic style of this game is the most beautiful thing I have seen from any indie game, hell GAME ever. Hell I could even talk about the subtle and amazing story hidden just beneath the cryptic way the story is betrayed. But the real masterpiece of this game is the story behind the development. Please if you truely want to understand why this game is just beyond amazing watch this video that VICE news did with the creator of Heart Machine and how this game came to be.

This game is a masterpiece and a staple of the pc modding community. While it has issues it always turns out to work in the end and thats the amazing part. I am mainly writing this review to inform people that   the error that was first reported on Feb 28 of 2018 is no longer an issue cause Activision fixed it  , which is quite surprising since this is a 10 year old game now. Anyway you already know what this game is by now I am sure, buy it its worth 20$.

Some are much harder to use than others, but slowly mastering them is really satisfying.  Lots of levels, with plenty of variation between them. There is also steam workshop for when you're fed up.  Great Splitscreen coop game, gets more and more chaotic the more players you add. Can often turn into madness trying to get each other killed then flex on their body.  For ?3 in the sale, I cant really say much more than this is a steal.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198126742472/recommended/304390,1, Firstly I got the base game for free during a steam special for it. Or maybe a ubisoft one. but i have now purchased the season pass 2017 and the marching fire dlc, not out yet as i write.  second, i play this game with xbox one controller. my review should be read in with that in mind.  this game i wish i had gotten round to install earlier; what stopped me was, i looked at the minimum specs and my 960m gpu in the laptop is 15% or so below. however i installed it just to see, and enjoyed it.  the game has a single player story in 3 stages; one for each knights, samurai and vikings. the story isnt bad, and not a token campaign as much as say CoD games. but mp is where this game is seeming aimed. mp is cross platform from what i read in game explanations.  the combat system can seem complicated, but is actually easier than it seemed at first. what was seeming complex is the lock on guard system which allows you to take one of 3 stances (one character in the story has a 4th) to match your enemy. this allows you to parry a blow from an enemy in the same stance. then you have a light (faster) blow, and heavy (slower) blow. those are the basics. the idea is to hit them when in a different stance, so they cant block and not get hit first. you dont need to be in a guard stance to attack though. there is a UI thing to show which stance the enemy is in and it goes red when they launch an attack. obviously you can also tell guard by looking at their weapon position.  on top, you have various other combinations of button presses for other moves which you can examine in the pause menu moveset. these include break guard moves, unblockable sweeping heavy moves, a heavy feint even. while it can seem frustrating with some bosses in the story, there is a satisfaction when you pull off a move right.  there are also abilities. in the story mode you can pick only two, and have a third you can pick up from the field such as a banner that gives health regen to nearby allies and you, or a catapult strike for example. in the mp side, you can have four. these abilities also level up like yourself with use.  mp: i think ubisoft did something clever here. in mp all your fights affect a campaign for which you have to pick a faction at the start, these last for a couple of weeks. at the end you get rewards of loot based on faction performance. then there are battles which end in hours which your fights are part of. you can see the current ones on the war map.  but additionally, ubisoft realised that some people wont be all that good against other players - so i notice you can also play against AI instead, at least in some modes. you can also make a custom game to do this, but you cant level up in custom games, but they are good for practise. so i can set up a skirmish, there will be a lot of ai soldiers and 3 ai heroes on my side and air soldiers and 4 ai heroes against us. and you still get experience and rewards, and soldiers you can assign or let the game assign to defend areas or i suppose attack. (im a defender by nature i think.)  i enjoy this game and recommend it, but it does have some annoyances. the first story mode in knights, there are helpful hint popups you have to hold the A button to close. good for the first time, but as yet i havent found a way to turn them off after one view in the UI settings.  also when setting up graphics, there is a benchmark thing i recommend you using. when the results appear, study the fps numbers carefully: because the game warns you when you play mp (not single player story though, or custom) if your fps dips too low you may be taken out of a game. the benchmark will inform you of any problems potentially, so you can fiddle with the graphics settings until they look okay.  some of the bosses in the story are so frustrating, that i dont want to replay that story (viking guy with the wolf pack, looking at you). that was on EASY difficulty.  also before you can actually play mp modes, you have to pass a test against your factions leader. i lost my battle 3-1 of the 5 rounds, but luckily that was enough to pass somehow. that could be VERY frustrating, but i remembered i did not have to pay for the base game which helped me enjoy what was essentially a fluke win (win by pushed the boss into a trap and then died just a half second later!)  if i was asked a summary... any frustration getting mp 'approved' is well worth it, feeling like you are a small leader of a few men and women in a large war is something new in that you know you are helping have a small effect. and the combat system does come to you, and is very satisfying when you just manage to win, and more when you annihilate the enemy, and still fun even in a loss sometimes. worth getting if you like medieval style combat, that isnt super realistic, just enough to be fun.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198015586815/recommended/8930,1, Firaxis took a lot of risks with this game, changing so much from Civ 4. However pretty much all of them have payed off, and made the game much better for it.  One great change is leaders speaking in their actual language making metting leaders more interesting. No stacking of military units is a massive plus, in civ 4 you were just smashing stack after stack into each other, it felt like there was no strategy. Now it is much more interesting and feels like it takes skill.  The only real thing I don't like about it is the announcer, he has a very boring voice. No where near as interesting as Leonard Nimroys. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198126742472/recommended/812140,1, i liked this one and it is now my fave over the others. ac origins is probably second, then ac4 black flag, and then ac brotherhood. ac 2 then finishes off the ones i really like but i never played the revolution one (name escapes me)  in this there will be spoilers so if you dont want to know plot stuff look away  this has the better combat mechanics than origins, and it has the ship sailing altered for ancient greece of course. the enemies are levelled like in origins so red skulls = run!   the gear system is changed again from origins and it took getting used to, but you can pick up materials for upgrades, though sometimes you might need to just keep doing that and it could become tedious. i routinely pick up anything i run across when travelling around anyways.  it could use a gear lock like destiny 2 so you dont dismantle something you wanted to keep. yes i did that. the dismantle time is long enough if you realise quick and stop the dismantle. but there are club items that dont dismantle at all. having them hang around atm but the ship has a store; i may see what i can put in there see if i can drop in the weapons and gear i cant use or dismantle.  all in all i think this game is great, even though im playing it well below specs.

Well it is for a while, untill you start having to wait for new items. This means that you are not free to experiment, there is also little interaction between objects instead they just burn.  Now I know that the timer is a crtique of in app purchases, but it detracts from what should be a really good game.  It does have a few good things going for it like art style and references to other media, but apart from that theres not much else. So yeah, avoid it unless its in a bundle with a load of other games.  Also don't forget to check out their other game &quot;World of goo&quot;, thats really good and has fun puzzles / gameplay. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198126742472/recommended/102500,1, This game is a little gem so far. First off: if you like to play with controller, you can. Just get to the menu and then start using it. They dont mention controller at all in the options for controls so unless you just try to use the controller, you might think it didnt support it.  The game doesnt really remind me of one particular other game; it has elements of dragon age but you only control one person (i prefer to do that; never enjoyed switching between stories in any game.). like skyrim you can get quests and follow up at your own pace. the world looks good and you fight in 3rd person. the combat system seems to work well enough though i keep forgetting to block so my shield doesnt get much use. it doesnt seem overly complex either.  it does have a gear damage and repair system like oblivion - use of armor and weapons causes them to deteriorate and you need to repair them up, but so far the upgrade gear is coming thick and fast so i can always fall back on soemthing i picked up, or swap to a new better piece.  this is an underrated game which i think anyone who likes rpg type action games will enjoy. i am very happy i bought it.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198126742472/recommended/582160,1, i didnt get off to a good start with origins on launch; the game wouldnt run at all. i had to get a refund  now a year later i rebought it, and im enjoying it immensely.  it has different control scheme to previous games i have - ac2 ac brotherhood and ac 4 black flag. it feels more like a fighting game, than a pure assassin game like the first few. its even less sneaky than shadow of mordor can be; though to be fair i have as yet only reached alexandria in it after the beginning.  im enjoying ancient egypt immensely; as always, the detour into the 'meta-story' of modern day or near future to it, is jarring for me. I would have been quite happy for all these games simply to be set in the past, with zero 'out of animus' stuff.  that being said, the new animus control panel thing - essentially an in game hacking feature - looks very promising. it comes with 3 presets including what amounts to an ironman, ultra realistic mode describing it as very hard to stay hidden but when you do an assassination it is instakill and very satisfying; to a god mode whereplayers like me who enjoy that kind of thing can basically romp through the game with supernatural power. to do this, however, it makes a copy of the save you are using; so you can then go back to playing at your normal chosen difficulty save at any time, simply by loading the save without 'hacked' on it.  this is on top of the difficulty settings, another new thing for me in assassins creed; i set it to easy, because im interested in fun rather than a masochist who likes dying over and over pointlessly wasting their little free play time in the name of some supposed 'challenge'.  if you enjoyed previous games, this one is different, the controls do take some adjusting to even with using a controller like i do, but i think you will enjoy it. its a worthy addition to the series.   it's a very good game, perhaps even better than Ac4 black flag.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198126742472/recommended/230410,1, firstly, i am enjoying this game - now i got over my annoyance 2 years ago (more in a spoiler paragraph at the end.)  for a game thats free to play, its fun for a combat game of this type - its in 3rd person and as yet i havent checked options for 1st person view but this is a game that doesnt need it imo. by default the matchmaking is set public, so if you had the experience i did at first of going in and finding 2 much higher level ppl running a lot faster, disappearing ahead and murderising all the enemies, you have the choice to change that - friends only, invite only, and solo. of course you could also let them do the killing and you open every chest etc they dash past. but letting others do the killing of enemies does mean your weapons dont level.  of course publci setting is useful if you have a mission with a tricky boss - i got lucky with someone and we did a stry mission boss together. it was a tough fight for me but we didnt die. so if you are having trouble with a mission, you can always solo lower level content to rank up, or go public (if you play solo) and hope some other players are looking too.  the levels of enemies are clearly marked on each location on the navigation map - BUT there is no real explanation of what YOUR comparison level is. it could be your gear levels - your warframe plus weapons, averaged; or it might be your mastery rank. i still have no clue, but as your weapons increase and warframe does, the enemies are easier on the lowest enemy levels.  mastery rank locks you out of some locations and from some weapons - and worse, you can only do a mastery 'trial' once every 24 hours. later on i expect this wont matter, but right now it was a little annoying to see that i was having to wait for the next rank, having reached it quickly.  it has a crafting and materials system - but dont expect to make something and walk away from the forge with it right away: i just got a blueprint and crafted something and forgot that its going to be ready in oh 24 hours... and i think i forgot that and so killed a previous craft i thought i had immediately finished.  the chat has an unusual feature - occasionally you will be reminded that you have 'been playing for over an hour, please remember to take breaks'. you could find that annoying and patronising, or useful and helpful. depending on if you forgot you put some food on to cook and now have a burned on mess in a saucepan to clean lol.  my destiny 2 reflexes keep kicking in - the game universe of the two games are very similar  (sort of catastrophic collapse in the past but different causes for warframe than from destiny AND destiny fell from a golden age - warframe's past didnt seem so golden for you, or many of the other 'races') but the gameplay isnt the same, and warframe has had a chat function for a lot longer (text chat i mean) so that is populated, where destiny 2 local chat its pure chance if anyone notices if you ask a question.  its free but as will free to play, theres a store where you can buy things which the credits you earn cant be used. but they dont ram it down your throat, there is nobody nagging you to go to that console to buy the pay for content every time you get back to the ship, and thats good.  i would recommend trying it - its a loot based shooter in some ways but also - you dont really get equipment loot, you can buy weapons once at the right mastery level with credits earned through play. but then you need to level them up. its more how they play - you might prefer one style of gun or sword over another. i hate shotguns so i dont have any for example. but i do like the bow for stealth kills from range, i like the sword i have but would like dual swords - and im using a pistol. i may change the pistol. its free so try it and see, its not like it costs unless you get into it and want to buy stuff.  SPOILER ALERT: if you dont want any clues at all about the first missions of the story, look away now. i got annoyed the first time i played this game. it has changed quite a bit since then: my frustration was caused by a mission with some urgency you get. you fight all the way to get the materials and make the thing to fix the problem the enemy give you. and then lotus tells you... basically you didnt. it felt like going to the bank and being told you paid the bills and then being told the bills still need to be paid despite all the effort and time you spent getting the money and paying them! add on top that when i tried to do other content and leave the story since it annoyed me, and just died from being too low EVERYWHERE, it was the last straw. BUT it seems different now - i still had to do (in a different way but the same end objective) when i came back today; but once it was done, other content was open.  it is a lot of fun for me, but that plotline really is annoying for me- i like to do things and then have them done, even if the enemy then react; thats better than a did-it-but-not-really.  others dont have an issue, and maybe i would not have if it wasnt the intro to the game basically. later on after a few more missions would been less likely to make people like me feel like that had done a lot of work and not gotten anywhere. still im past it and enjoying the game now.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033417641/recommended/595520,1, opinion from someone who stopped playing final fantasy at final fantasy 10 in 2002. half hour in 60 FPS with no drops yet. smooth game play so far. more smooth than the FF10 HD rerelease. 3 hours in. the battle system is open style and pleasantly different yet still turn based. the game defaulted my controller to O as interact and X as cancel, brings me back to FF7. plenty of literary interactions like the older FF installments. it feels like a new oldish game (it is). finally a playable version of the game. i owned a collectors edition version of the ps2 game. i never played it. the graphics on ps2 that late were horrible. one thing i find funny with most rereleases of any sort is there is usually an optional easy version/ways make your journey easier. kids suck at videos games.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198126742472/recommended/460920,1, Steep is a game i found out about quite by chance on steam store. its an ubisoft game so you will be running uplay and steam together unless you buy it elsewhere and use key activation.  steep is a mountain sports game. i play it with a controller - i have a wired xbox one controller for pc.  you start off with a tutorial which i wont go into, for spoiler reasons. the tutorial videos are comprehensive, but a bit slow if a fast reader - and you can skip them. i assume further tutorials exist for each activity you can do - wingsuit, paragliding, snowboarding, the activity wheel shows all of them, skiing - there are a number, but some like sledding when i highlighted on the map, it told me to buy a sled 'in the store'. some events on the map like the road to the pyongchang olympics, are dlc you must buy.  the game itself, since i am on ASUS ROG GL552VW gaming laptop, is all running in low graphics, on a 1920x1080 screen - and it looks stunning. very convincing mountain landscape. i prefer snowboarding to all the other activities on offer. the controls on controller seem simple and effective. the powder is good so lets get out there!  you got options on map that i saw (havent tried) to change time of day, but there was one event that seemed named to be a night event so that may be changed when certain events are entered. you will see other players around and you can group with them, they can invite you, so there are mp controls. it doesnt have to be solo unless like me you prefer it (none of my friends seem to have steep that i can see). you can do spins and rolls and grabs off the jumps and  i just enjoyed riding my own path down the slopes sometimes without trying an event. it reminds me a lot of the SSX3 peak 1 back country in that respect, which was always my fave.  is it SSX3? no, but then what it IS, is an example of what a good SSX game could be if EA didnt have its 'more X-treeem!' finger up its????? and recognised that sometimes (SSX3 for example) you dont need to change everything round and add lots of stuff (like in SSX On Tour....) to make a good game that will sell. if SSX3 had gone open world like Steep, or just revisited the big mountain 3 peaks, added more and better runs even it would be this good. EA could learn that much from this game - sometimes less is more. you dont have the uber tricks in steep that ssx has; but do you really need them?  i am enjoying the game, even though a lot of the other activities dont really interest me. it even has a sort of career mode thing going on, with levelling up getting you unlocks of the big peaks, and event invites - one of the earliest things in the beginner walkthrough at the start will unlock a red bull event. some of the custom gear you can wear is branded also. even though i bought this game when on offer (i think 70% off) it had been on my wishlist, and i am very happy i got it. i would have paid normal price for it, had i known it was this good or had a trial version or something. i am looking at maybe buying the olympic stuff too.  if you enjoy snowboarding or skiing or just the mountains, i think you might enjoy this one.

I like that you can pretty much combine all of them with each other if you want to do so, but it's also nice to find the ones that compliment each other really well.  Kind of a challenge to do that, if you don't use a guide.  :)  All in all, still one of my top three FF games.  Tactics, not TA but just Tactics, then six, then twelve.  The game play hasn't changed to me, so honestly, the class system was the only overhaul I truly noticed.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198126742472/recommended/247000,1, this game brings back memories of playing the board game, though it looks subtly different, not a bad thing. what nearly killed the table top publisher was the explosion in computer gaming so its good to see they found a way through.  i enjoy playing this game, its a nice way to pass the time. i havent got any of the expansions as of writing review, but i want to.   apart from memories, i dont play this game online, and if it is anything like the single player, then it is missing some of the fun you can have with an actual board game version. i have memories of things that simply arent possible with this version of the game i have - of in particular and as an example, a halfling with a particularly charmed life on the die roll, getting an amazing strength level, who also would take gold bribes under the table from players in the form of cantracts to kill the other players! lots of fun. that halfling of course, bored with all the gold, eventually went for the crown of command. i forget precisely who won that game but it was probably him. you just cant improvise game mechanics like that.   nor can you improvise hiring someone to go kill an annoying face up witch card, and the rules of the combat (you have to roll before attacking her being one!) but less the... non standard rules you can make up with the board game at a table, this is definitely the next best thing. probably not for everyones taste though it must be added.  the tutorial tips are quite useful and you can disable them in options... i dont think there is a game manual in-game, so :maybe have to download it if there is a pdf or something somewhere, as i wasted a raft by not reading the card, and its not obvious without re-reading it how to use it for example. but its not that difficult in my opinion and you can do without but a pdf someplace would be nice. that part of this game wasnt in the original board game version i had in the early 90s.  i recommend this if you had the old game as part nostalgia and part improvement. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198126742472/recommended/595520,1, it could do with difficulty levels. its too easy to wipe out when save points are so far apart and you burn through potions so fast even with gambits. plus if the last save point is way back in previous segment, and you re-enter that segment, all the monsters respawned, and your toast. cant go forward and cant go back.  so it can be frustrating, just trying to follow the story from the start - but characters in game do warn you about 'insufficient planning' before you get into the the big story set piece with vaan. what they mean is... dont do the story right out. hang around, explore the city and areas around, do some random encounters and LEVEL UP. i cant work out if the enemies are levelled based on area or based on you , and its been a long time since i played it on ps2. oh and you can never have enough health potions. make sure you dont use them too early - or you run out. but if you set gambits too low, then people die before the potions are used. catch 22.  graphically it looks a lot better than on the old version and the reochestrated soundtrack is good too. there are two pc options for new game plus or minus also - minus you dont get xp to level, and plus you start at level 90 apparently.  the game can be fun, but like many final fantasy games, can be annoying and frustrating as hell, especially if you find out you have to go back to a very early save and do some collecting of potions before trying the long drawn out scene with vaan needing to get in then  escape.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198126742472/recommended/730310,1, ok so its here, and im enjoying it a lot. massive changes. the voice actors are all different; i get the impression this will be something you either get used to or hate, but i look at it as, new way of doing the game so why not try new voices too. voices would have to change anyway unless they make all the voice actors immortal in real life!  i really like the freedom to run around or ride around before taking on the story missions; having said that, i find it a test of nerve since i keep seeing notices that an enemy has defeated one of our side. im not sure that happens with the missions that advance the story though.  tutorial mission has some text bugs - i had to do a Fell something attack and it gives it as RB + B on controller but its really RB + A. probably because of the japanese controller setup swaps A and B functions round. B = O on ps controller so A = X and in menus in japan X = cancel O = OK. looks like the localisation team missed one.  using the bow with controller is annoying, the right stick is far too sensitive and i wind up reverting to aiming bow with mouse and then firing with controller button! this makes hunting animals with bow almost impossible, so i just ride into the herd and slash them down with my sword. no style points, but i get the materials.  the minimum system specs needed are pretty much accurate. i have it running with everything set low and getting around 25 fps at best 1920x1080, my gtx 960m 2gb is 20% below minimum. im going to try lowering resolution see if that makes it run better.  you can set up graphix from main menu options, but not once playing - have to quit to menu again. makes setting it up on below minimum systems a slight pain.  china looks great to me, but then i am a fan of the series and i like the history side of it, lots of things to do BUT; this is not skyrim. open world it is, but you have to pick a hero to play, you cant roll your own. if the next game or empires uses open world too, and you can make your own character, i think it will be even better.  even though i missed on the discount due to a steam mistake, i think if you like the series, you will fall into a love or hate camp. personally i hope this game does well - for all the love of the series my fave ones were the empires games simply because you could make the story. the story may still happen regardless of your actions in this game too - but the open world means the battles are going to have more replay appeal imo.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198126742472/recommended/208730,1, i know its a bit late for a review but hey, better late than never.   i have begun playing this game. i have not yet managed to find the money to get the books and have not seen more than adverts for the tv series, so my comments are basically all about the game. i cant say right now if the game captures westeros accurately as a result.  the control system is a bit clunky though works ok with controller once you get the hang of it - but there is a thing with what i call 'late unlocked abilities'. you dont get all the secondary type abilities unlocked when you make the character. i like the idea of strengths and weaknesses you can pick up to 3 of each when making a character, and having them balance each other out; even though part of me says 'whats the point if it balances out.   the starting story has a problem i learned to dislike with another game, and which i named after that game: it has Call-of-Duty-itis. i DONT mean its like a shooter; i mean that you just get into the starting characters story and it dumps into another 'new character' mode with someone else entirely. its a personal thing for me - i want to just play one character per playthrough. i prefer it like skyrim in that respect - you play one character all the way in that game unless you start a new game.  the game plays a lot like dragon age origins - you have a small team but i never really use the character swap. as i say i like to stick with one hero or whatever. the stories so far have been interesting. though i am not far in, so far.  even with my problems with switching stories and characters, i would recommend this game on its own merits. its not a classic, but it could be a fun diversion if the story doesnt depress you. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/agentjaytee/recommended/274190,1, This game has been a BLAST to play couch co-op! 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970566534/recommended/12210,-1, The Game won't let you save or load anymore because &quot;Games for Windows Live&quot; doesn't seem to be supported any longer... Also Rockstar took the liberty of removing quite a bunch of beloved songs from the outstanding soundtrack because they must have thought that they are too poor for renewing a few licenses... I feel kind of robbed and can't recommend this game in this state to anyone anymore!!!!!! F. Rockstar... 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/agentjaytee/recommended/201810,1, I highly recommend this game. I've replayed it twice now, and will probably come back to it because I want to finish both story branches.   The graphics, the gunplay, the storyline, all fantastic!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/agentjaytee/recommended/22320,1, I recommend this game with a 10 out of 5 rating! I have loved this game every since it first came out. It has an eternal replayability to it that will fight hard against compatibility issues with newer generation computers. If you don't own this game, take a leap and purchase it. I am willing to bet the price you pay that you will not regret it! Both Thumbs Up! Very Nice! Good Show! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/fazul_/recommended/389570,1, Great game, so much better then the original Agar.io. As there is WAY less lag and so much more fun with the gamemodes aswell. Despite the occassional lag spikes, its great.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/agentjaytee/recommended/360430,1, I pre-ordered the digital deluxe edition of this game based on my experience with Mafia II and curiosity with the advertised concept of dealing with the Mafia and the late 60s as a black Vietnam Veteran. Heads up: they did not sugar coat this experience.  I have to say, I feel I got my money's worth and enjoyed the game. As I type this, I have 109.5 hours on record, completed every achievement, and plan to play more if they add more content.  The DLC content is intended to be short stories interjected into the big story of the main game. If you are not a completionist, you can get a complete experience with just the original game, and the majority of my game time came from that. You also get a choice if you want your takedowns to be lethal or not (also, the Sign of Times DLC has a dart gun, but the story has a very dark element to the plot and may not be enjoyable to someone who has chosen a less lethal playthrough)  While there is no real endgame content--you reach a point where the only readily available enemy is the police and there is nothing to do except race and wait for money--the fact that I was able to get this much time out of it should speak to its price. Right now, if you purchase all the content, you're looking at about $65 USD; so, I got 109.5 hours of gaming for less than $1/hour.  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/fazul_/recommended/304050,-1, This game seemed alright but i for one, would like Trove to use OCE servers aswell. I would've played this game alot more but it lags since it isn't on the right server.. so make an OCE server and i would deffinately play some more. Thanks :) 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/fazul_/recommended/4000,1, I have honestly played way too much of this game, yet i keep wanting to come back for more. would recommend.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/aaronmitre21/recommended/449800,1, Love this game. It actually for me felt like a genuine game that held true to the awesome anime it represents. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044903265/recommended/384190,1, I play this on my TV in my bedroom. It is very nice and calming. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/aaronmitre21/recommended/307780,1, Love this game and it was just announced the XL edition should be coming shortly to PC finally! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/fosterdempeople/recommended/268910,1, &quot;This game is like anal- hard and painful, but you'll get used to it.&quot; 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/agentjaytee/recommended/758530,1, Short. Hand drawn animation style that reminds me of Reading Rainbow. Easy, but not mindless. Simple achievements. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/aaronmitre21/recommended/356190,1, Love this game and I have to say its fantastic how in depth you can go in the game. It may seem repetitive at times, but it still has a ton of content to offer to keep things rolling. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/agentjaytee/recommended/6830,1, It's sad that this genre isn't surviving. I played this game so much when I was younger. Replayed each level so much I almost had enemy locations, habits, etc. memorized. I highly recommend you get this game. It's a classic. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/fazul_/recommended/253650,1, Sparkle 2 Evo was a game that i found myself to not enjoy on first sight, however as the game went on, i found it very relaxing and entertaining in a sort of way. It is a game that you could easily sink 1.5 - 2 hours in, It consists of the main animal (thing) of eating other blobs to grow, which later you would begin eating other animals aswell. This was entertaining as i (personally) haven't played any of the other games that are based on eating smaller animals to grow, etc. It had beautiful, consistant graphics and each new animal and background i discovered all shocked me, as they really were beautiful.  However, it is not a game i would see myself playing again, as it just doesn't seem like one of those games you would play over and over. I rate it a 8/10. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044903265/recommended/409160,1, Do you like short films?   That special feeling of beeing taken on a wonderful complex journey that suddenly ends too soon and the rest is left to your imagination?   This game is giving you exactly that.   And it's doing a fantastic job at it.    Don't read the spoilers. The less you know the better the game is.    EDIT: Updated the review for SACS. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/aaronmitre21/recommended/374320,1, Love this game all around. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/fosterdempeople/recommended/459820,1, Recommended ONLY if you're extremely patient and want to see all the girls. T_T 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/aaronmitre21/recommended/268910,1, Very well made indie game. I love the old 1920s style animations and the gameplay is smooth. It also allows for coop play which is a big plus in my book. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/aaronmitre21/recommended/49540,1, Very fun game looks even better with the graphics mod. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/fosterdempeople/recommended/628730,1, loli santa was pretty cute so why not 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/agentjaytee/recommended/50130,1, I love this game. The 1940-60 feel is well accomplished in this game. Driving is probably a little too realistic (aka bad handling since it's older cars) Storyline is your average mobster flick, except with less focus on you rising through the ranks; more the story of the average Joe (haha you'll get it if you play). I would recommend it, but I also warn you that the replayability is practically none and once you beat it, the fun pretty much stops. The DLC are all &quot;meh&quot;. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/fosterdempeople/recommended/978000,1, Looking forward to what 2019 has in store for this game! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/fosterdempeople/recommended/698780,1, Made a mistake playing this alone at night. It was so  sickeningly sweet  that I cried for two hours straight. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/fazul_/recommended/301520,1, Love this game, it's really good especially since it's still new, there was a bug i encountered here and there,  which would be falling out of the world... but other than that, the game is doing really well, keep it up guys!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/aaronmitre21/recommended/261570,1, Fantastically fun game. And Amazing artwork design. Definitly worth playing. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/thehijazpahron/recommended/225080,1, Brothers isn't so much of a game as it is a journey. Beautiful and full of heart, the game is a roller coaster of emotions. Alternating between states of wondrous charm, to suspenseful dread, and right down to tugging at your heartstrings like an emotional wrecking ball; it's not so much about the ending, as it is the adventure towards it.  The actual 'game' elements are very light. Straight forward puzzles, and some mild platforming bits. The gameplay merely serves as a vehicle for the story, seldom getting in the way of letting you enjoy the gorgeous world unfolding before you.  Although the game is rather short, it doesn't overstay it's welcome, and is the perfect length for what it sets out to achieve.  Highly recommended. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/aaronmitre21/recommended/274190,1, Amazing game! Brings some nostalgia back for me. Has great amount of characters with different specials. Has great coop and vs.  modes. Definitely a must buy I would say.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/motorkar/recommended/384190,1, This game is something special, I like to play just for the fun from exploring, enjoying beautiful colours and species under the sea. It looks like the floating space without borders, but there's some kinda story line which you can follow and discover new places and things. Really worth to try game and as always, need more time to play games like this!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/motorkar/recommended/22000,1, OK, this review was firstly written in old days so it was only about one word ... rulezzz.  Now I have decided to write more about it, but please don't expect too much, I am not author of bestsellers.   What I wanted to say is, this game is really great enjoyable and moody. The look of graphics, the underline with interesting music and the weird small characters really forces you into some sort of mood which pushes you into next levels :)   The game is all about managing small fluffy rubber jelly things to make the way to the end of level and to manage bring to the end the needable count of game characters. The game characters? Oh this - it - or what - is goo? Maybe goo is the characters :) anyway. This is really funny game and I think I will find my way back to it and play it again.  This turned out to be more like adorment than full review, so sorry for it, but I like the goo, so goo-d day to you all and goo for the king! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/motorkar/recommended/316790,1, I've played this game in past outside of steam and it was great. This time when I have tried it after some years again, I enjoyed it very much. It's even better with remastered version, but that's not the graphics you should think about in this game. This game is filled with awesome humour which can't let you without laughing nearly every minute you'll playing this.   I am looking forward to continue playing this and if you want to be advised, go and try this game. You'll never regret this :D   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=801370220    http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=801370888

https://steamcommunity.com/id/thehijazpahron/recommended/273350,1, I'm not going to repeat anything any other review site already said. Evolve is a unique, well-designed, balanced, gorgeous, and sometimes inconsistent experience. At it's best, with a great group of people, it's amazing. At it's worst, it can be downright boring and frustrating dealing with players who don't communicate or can't play their role effectively. Go and read any other professional review for details.  What I'm going to stress however, is the overreaction people seem to have on the whole DLC issue. I'll put it in points to clarify certain things that people seem to be complaining about, unfounded or otherwise.  - Is there day one DLC?  YES. Skins. Just skins. Do they effect the game in any way that gives players who buy it an advantage? NO. Are they forcing you to buy it? NO. So why are you complaining? You don't like it, don't buy it. No need to moan about how it's 'supposed' to be in the game.  - Is the game worth the full price tag? Yes, in no way does the base game feel incomplete, or that there is anything that was 'purposely left out' to later be cashed in as DLC. You get a fully competent, balanced, mostly glitch-free game for your money, which is more than I can say for most AAA titles recently.  - They already stated that they will be giving out future maps for FREE. This is something that pretty much no other modern online shooter is doing. Games like COD, Battlefield and the like, release new maps that you need to purchase, otherwise you can't play with a certain group of players. With Evolve, the player base is not split based on the purchase of DLC. Anyone can play with or against anyone, regardless if they decided to pay up for more content.  - NO, the extra hunters and monsters aren't already done and being 'purposely held back' to be cashed in sometime in the future. If you follow the development process, this extra content isn't even close to being done. Stop saying that they're trying to milk you for more money.  However, I do agree with certain complaints  - The pricing for the DLC is downright ridiculous. Skins shouldn't cost that much. But again, nobody is forcing you to buy them, and in no way do they give players an unfair advantage.  - The 'season pass' does not contain all of the future content, which can be confusing and frustrating. This I find to be absurd, when a season pass usually means that it should allow you access to all the DLC that will be released. They should really reconsider the contents of the pass.  - The way the different packages of the game are being promoted is downright confusing. This I understand why it drew the ire of quite a number of people.  In conclusion, although the way the DLC is being marketed isn't perfect, most of the hate people seem to be giving it is largely exaggerated. Evolve is a great game, and poor marketing shouldn't deter you from diving into a truly unique experience. Just be a smarter consumer and do some research on the DLC options if you have your doubts.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/gilboron/recommended/219890,1, So, I just beat Antichamber. I think. The fact that I'm uncertain about that already tells you a whole lot about this game. In technical terms, one would describe it best as a first-person Metroidvania puzzler; but most conventional genre descriptors are far too generic for this convention-defier. If you love puzzles that are so headache-inducingly ingenious that the preposterous becomes intuitive, or if you just like to have your gray matter tickled, I'd definitely recommend this game.  One downside I'd note, though, is that - for some people, such as myself - the game is not only figuratively, but also literally headache-inducing. I'm not sure whether it's the brightness of the visuals, the ambient sound design, or what, but I found it difficult to play this game for extended stretches of time, which is a shame because the game is quite addicting!  Oh, I should also add, the game was very kindly gifted to me; I would not say it's worth its current price tag, though how long you'll be playing it will strongly depend on your wits and your willpower to resist looking up strategy guides.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/gilboron/recommended/312230,1, A short, but atmospheric and thoroughly enjoyable sci-fi game that takes inspiration primarily from Alien and System Shock 2, with some noticeable smaller influences from Deus Ex. Most easily described as a mini-System Shock 2 with just the robotic enemies. Highly recommended if you can get it on sale.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/motorkar/recommended/7200,1, This game is really awesome racing game, with completely simple look of the idea of racing. You should only care about time you have in finish of the race.   Sounds easy? Well at first, yes, but you should know, that it's not that easy. There are many levels, where you should firstly try them many times to find best way to the end.  This is just small info about the game, well take a look more closer.  TrackMania United is the paid game based on  TrackMania Nations Forever , which is free. You can try it and take a look at the race model and have big fun too. In the United edition you find many more stuff, like many game modes from simple to multi player races, you can compete with your own time, your friends and whole community over the internet, and you should know that the community is huge!  There are even competitions with real world standings so if you fall into this game, you should make much time to spend it here :D. You can choose to play as single player at the beginning, if you are worried to know how bad racer you are ;-) but practise makes perfect, so you will have great progress in time.   Single player is all about having better and better times and to get medals - from bronze to gold, but if you obtain better time than creator of the map (or let's say something like par in golf) you will get  green Nadeo medal  [en.tm-ladder.com] , and be happy :D. One more thing: with winning medals you get in-game currency named coopers.  OK, let's continue, medals you can get in races from classical races, to platform, stunt and puzzle races in many environments where the stadium one is similar in Nations version.   There is availability to modify your vehicles - at least the design of color and stickers, you can even write something on your car - place there your national flag or so ...  The last but not least option is to make your own track and if you will be good in it, you can show it to the community and compete your time with theirs.  The game is really great and if you want to take a break from killing creatures or from saving worlds try this one and enjoy :)

https://steamcommunity.com/id/gilboron/recommended/637100,1, Sonic Forces is not a perfect game; in fact, it has several very concrete flaws. Then again, which Sonic game doesn't? I thoroughly enjoyed the game despite its issues, if only for the visual spectacle and character moments. Oh, and the character creator. That stuff's very addicting to me. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198060342152/recommended/239220,-1, So ich hab das Spiel jetzt eine weile gespielt und mu? sagen das es mal wieder eine vergebene Chance ist.  Das Spiel hat so viel Potential, das aber zu gunsten von Pay to Win Inhalten nicht genutzt wird, wenn man einen kleinen Charakter spielt macht das Spiel zwar durchaus eine weile spa?, aber sp?testens wenn man den Lv 20+ bereich ereicht wird aus Spa? nur noch Frust, weil einem ab dann in den meisten Schl?ssern der selbe DLC Boss und Praktisch f¨¹r nicht Premium Spieler un¨¹berwindbahre Fallen erwarten, die so enorme Vorteile haben das sie die gesamte Balance des Spiels zerst?ren.  Deswegen w¨¹rde ich jedem Spieler der nicht bereit ist hunderte von Euro f¨¹r Premium Inhalte zu investieren davon abraten dieses Spiel zu Spielen, da f¨¹r solche Spieler auf kurz oder lang der Spielspa? auf der strecke bleibt. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/gilboron/recommended/384190,1, Short but beautiful - that's how I'd review ABZ? in three words. It's beautiful in more ways than one, too; the environments look incredible, and the story is also conveyed really well without any dialogue. To boot it's very relaxing to play, although some parts do require some precise swimming and those parts weren't always as enjoyable.  The main problem with the game is that It is short; really short. It'd be perfectly feasible to buy this, play it all the way through, and still be able to refund it, provided you don't try to go for all the collectibles like I did. Now, I don't think that's a dealbreaker per se, even if just because of how beautiful it is - you could consider it an interactive animated movie.  However, even having received it as a gift, I don't think that experience is worth 20 euros; so I'd recommend waiting until a sale to buy it.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/hersharan/recommended/414340,1,  Awesome Story and psychological theme  with:    good puzzles,    exploring (for some its a walking simulator )    good hack/slash fight style, good enough as per the game's theme and length.    visual environment are set beautifully.    Music is &lt;3 , OST for background and battles are awesome, specially the finale battle ( search - Passarella Death Squad - Just Like Sleep )    good backstory and  lorestones.    Easy to get 100% achivements (for perfectionists).   the finale battle and scenes are truly mesmerizing.   The 4 challenges are awesome test of senua.    Listen to the voices/ 'Furies' of senua's mind.   Headphones are must.   Must Play!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/gilboron/recommended/72850,1,  EDIT:  Massive props to Bethesda for admitting they made a mistake! Mods can no longer be behind paywalls!   [TL;DR: Fixing core game issues can require additional costs in the future, buy another Elder Scrolls game instead.]   Overall, my opinion of Skyrim is very mixed, because it has both pros and cons. Let me elaborate.  On the positive side of things, Skyrim improves greatly on its predecessors in a lot of ways. Many things are more streamlined or made more consistent, you get a lot more combat options, spells are more unique, and you have the addition of more unique combat encounters in the form of dragons. Radiant quests also make sure you always have something to do, but that brings me to my negative points...  Questlines and characters are, with the exception of the Daedric quests, flat and uninspired. Nothing you do - no matter what the dialogue may imply - has ANY considerable or lasting effect on the world, and that makes it hard to motivate yourself in the end game, when you're so overpowered that combat is a butchering at best and a slap fight at worst. That's not the only negative, either - but the other negatives deserve a paragraph of their own, considering recent decisions from Bethesda and Valve.  The game is exceedingly glitchy and buggy. On top of that, most of the pros I mentioned are only potential pros, that need a lot of polish to actually lend positivity to the game. This used to be a non-issue thanks to mods - but now, Valve is pushing for modders to put their work behind a paywall. This creates a TON of new issues: fixing game problems can now cost money. And if incompatible mods create a bug, you might have just wasted money, or worse have to spend additional money to fix it. You may argue that this won't happen to all mods, but consider that sharing resources between modders will become exceedingly rare now that profits are involved. This whole fiasco of a train wreck is essentially a microcosm of everything that's wrong with modern capitalism. Plus, one mod that EVERYONE considers essential (in fact, a lot of mods require it), SkyUI, is already going P2P.  Honestly, at this rate, I'd really recommend buying Morrowind or Oblivion instead. Or, hell, I'd recommend Elder Scrolls Online over this. At least that game is fully functional without potentially requiring additional purchases.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/teepressio/recommended/381210,1, People are toxic - but let's be honest, who's not toxic in a PvP game like this?  On the plus side, the dev's do their best to keep everything balanced. They're continuously working on the game to make it more fair for everyone to play, and when something gets out of balance they do their best to redo it to fix the issue, prevent cheating, etc.  Gamewise I'd definitely suggest if you like spoopy games that base more around skill and technique than just trying to scare. Everyone has a different technique with a vast amount of skills you can use, which makes it all the better.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/teepressio/recommended/252490,1, I've never got around to reviewing this game, but i feel i need to. It really is fantastic. Definitely has some of the most caring developers of anything ive played. They truly listen to the community and experiment wisely without breaking the foundation of what Rust is at heart. Solid Updates WEEKLY. Check out their reddit if you're curious.  Its a hard-core pvp survival not for the faint of heart. You will get murked. Rust is merciless. But if you persevere through the ???????t it will be totally worth the challenge. They say you can't play solo but I do quite often, successfully. You just need to play on a solo or solo/duo/trio community server. Speaking of, the community as a whole IS quite toxic but that doesnt mean everyone is. I've met plenty of good people in-game. The game's depth comes with the experiences you encounter with other players as well as the building aspect. Building is definitely my favorite part and theyre starting to add more cosmetic items like carpets and chairs, ect.  Farm&gt;Build&gt;Loot&gt;Upgrade&gt;Roam. Not really in that order specifically but this is what you do in Rust. Sounds basic but it always tend to keep people interested week after week. You dont necessarily TBC, but is that all needed to understand this??????is real. good game. buy, buy

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xathier337/recommended/377160,1, It's good.  It's not great, and maybe not as mind blowing as Fallout 3 was to me as a kid, but the job it does is okay. It's not exactly a good Fallout game per se, but it's still a fun game with plenty of modding capability, so it can be tweaked and changed to your will any way you like it. You can't really lose.  I'd recommend waiting on a sale for it though.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xathier337/recommended/755790,1, I only played 1 game so far, but have my fair share of experience with PuBG and especially Fortnite.  This game is very wonderful in many ways, and certainly with your time if you want to try it out.  Up to 4 people can win a match. Adventure Pass system is incredibly rewarding for both free and paid versions. 3 different &quot;classes&quot; allow for slightly different playstyles each time, however aren't crucial to know your way around to be good. overall aesthetics are very nice. game feels very optimised compared to other BR titles I've played. Adventure pass system features Daily and weekly challenges, very similar to Fortnite but hey, don't fix what ain't broke. That system works well in both games.  I definitely recommend giving it a shot. There may also be a bots mode coming for all my casual players out there! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xathier337/recommended/845070,1, If you liked Life Is Strange, this game very much captures that sense of curiosity and wonder I feel the previous games managed to capture. If you haven't, it has no connection to the other games, so you can jump in without any homework.  It's free. It's about 2 hours long. You can't lose anything from giving it a shot. I can almost guarantee you'll like it, if not love it.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterSaintxx/recommended/322170,1, If you're looking for a fast paced game then there is no better game than this. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xathier337/recommended/252490,-1, It's an interesting game. It's basically an MMO, so you're gonna run into a lot of crappy people who want nothing but to kill you for no other reason than sport, and it's gonna be the most emotionally draining thing, not to forget frustrating. Few days of hard work, down the drain, for no other reason than people just being jerks. When you do run into people who not only not want to kill you, but also even HELP YOU, this game absolutely shines. It's a great experience. So it's honestly up to you in if you want to buy it or not.  Personally, I'd wait for a sale, and get a copy for a friend, or better, play with someone experienced. This game is confusing as heck, you won't know what to do, and once you start getting your foot in the door of the basics on wht to do, it's gonna get hard.  Personal: 5/10. Your experience is solely based of whether or not people are jerks and hate you for no reason. No single-player. Can't make a server for just you and friends, simply.  Edit: Also your appearance is randomized and set based on your Steam ID. Not being able to change appearances at all sucks, and the devs including some of the community praise this decision. Personally, I think it's needlessly stupid, and I want to be represented in a game I paid money for, thanks. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xathier337/recommended/582010,1, MH:World is real good. It's the most accessible, funnest MH game to play to date in my honest opinion, and improves on a lot of existing mechanics to make things more fun, and accessible to newer players.  I played a handful of Gen myself on the 3DS with some friends, so I wouldn't say I have a very extensive background on the series, but I can tell you that World is much friendlier to new players, and is so far providing me with some of my funnest Monster Hunter moments in the first few hours of play.  I definitely recommend it if you have the cash and rig. There's a handful of settings you can tinker, and if I can run it with a GTX 760 at a good 50-60 FPS, I' sure you can find some way to make it work for your system. My internet is also pretty poor, topping at a 300kb/s download speed on average, and I've run into 0 problems so far with connectivity with friends halfway across the world. It's truly something amazing how well this works with my current setup. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterSaintxx/recommended/214250,-1, Feels incomplete plus there are a lot of issues. The negative reviews will tell you all. Graphics are good tho. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_agent_t/recommended/271590,1, One of my favourite genre 'Open world' games. I have played most of the open world genre games and GTA V was the best. I haven't  played single player world cause it's  kinda boring for me. Multiplayer is lot good only if there were some improvements in the multiplayer server. The server takes alot of time to load aswell apart from loading, the features in the multiplayer section is love. There are so many freakin things you can do with your friends. I haven't  spent lot of time in this game on steam though, but still I loved it. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_agent_t/recommended/10,1, The game is still alive, that's the incredible thing about it. The game had no official servers, If I could recall the players had to host their own server via HLDJ even after having this flaw, Counter-strike had lot of servers, variety of servers and bunch of players. Counter-strike was my first multiplayer game, I started playing this on pub servers (casual terrorist vs counter-terrorist). But the real fun was on multimod servers with lot of different and interesting mods.  * There are still many servers up and with decent players. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_agent_t/recommended/578080,1, Okay, the game was lot better in early access. The devs are taking lot of time to fix these minor bugs. I know they're trying their best (or maybe not?) but these bugs are getting worse. I stopped playing the game as there are many bugs and less features. I heard that the people aren't even able to select servers now. You will be forced to play in a server where you might get 200 ping, you won't be able to pickup any survival items on time. * I would still recommend this game to those who are up for casual gaming and not serious gaming. Serious gamers will probably rage when they face these minor bugs and ping issues. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_agent_t/recommended/550,1, Left 4 Dead 2 is a good Co-op multiplayer game, you and your friends will enjoy playing this game. The levels and objectives are quite good &lt;3. The game is not made for solo-gamers. you can play it solo but it will be boring AF, the bots are helpful but you wont be able to complete the levels easily. Playing with 2 or 3 others will be awesome. 1$ for this game during sale is a steal deal. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_agent_t/recommended/206420,1, Including saints row 3 in my review, saints row 3 also had a great gameplay. The features were much exciting. The devs have done lot of improvements  between SR4 and SR3 (Doubled). The SR4 is included with superpowers to create a huge bunch of mayhem in the city. The features, weapons, powers are quite exciting. I bet, people who are into open  world genre will definitly  like this game.  * I had played this game on my potato PC back then, Now that I have upgraded my pc, I'll be installing this game again to play at max settings &lt;3

https://steamcommunity.com/id/GireiGD/recommended/288470,-1, The only problems I see with the game are, for some reason minimap, spells apart from my lightning spell from the beginning, and any buttons or tools supposed to appear on-screen, are nowhere to be found. My screen is completely empty, unlike the original Fable. I'm so used to seeing the minimap in my corner and buttons in the bottom left letting me switch between spells and teleport. But for some reason the only spell the game will let me use is lightning, I have to navigate everything myself with no knowledge of where traders or enemies are, and I have NO sense of how much health or mana I have because there is NO health or mana bar.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/NupiteX/recommended/268910,1, Best Game I Think 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/IgorDotNinja/recommended/274230,1, Its an ok game, i can recommend it, there are a few things that i hate, and a few that i like  First of all, about the game: - This is a turned based strategy action game (you make a move, then the enemy makes a move, you are using strategy to predict their moves) - This game contains stealth elements, some maps allow you to play with stealth, so that the civilains or some other enemies dont see you. (tips say this is not a stealth game, but it has a lot of it, also tips lie) - The game lets you move freely, and you can freeze time and plan your moves, when you get in a fight the time stops and each turn is about 1 second long. - I wasnt really following the story, but i think the story is to kill the bad guys :D  Bugs: - A lot of times when im on a platform and i want to jump to the side and down, the guy just makes one little step and i die, so when you are on a platform you can only go straight down, OR anywhere above (up left, up right) - The white guys, and the red boss are getting stuck in walls, and they dont see me, they just call for a lockdown. - if im hanging on a ledge game doesnt allow me to do much, i would like to throw a rope and push myself off, but nope, you can only go down and even that doesnt work sometimes. - Checkpoint system sucks, some maps are linear 1-2-3-4, and i sneaked passed one part of the map(2), and finished(3), then i went back (2) and completed that, and checkpoint is made there (2). and i have to go through the part i finished (3) every time, to get to the next part (4).  What i like: - Stealth  - Movement  What i dont like: - The bugs They are driving me insane, sometimes i even want to break the keyboard just because of the bugs - The Game is short for me  - Not a lot of powers (i rearly used the decoy projection) - I expected the bosses to have interesting powers, like the scientist for example to be a samurai robot that ih ave to defeat.  It took me about 10 hours to get through the whole game and get all the power ups (without raising alarms, without killing civilans, and killed all enemies). i started the game plus but its a bit hard for me, im bearly finishing the levels. but i will finish that too. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/IgorDotNinja/recommended/206190,1, Game is great, but also buggy  Gameplay: its a puzzle platformer with stealth elements.  I finished the game in 3 hours(and i tried to do it mostly perfect the first time, if i rushed i could finished it faster), and then total 10 hours for all the achievements. (i would do that faster if the game wasnt buggy)  Bad stuff: - Resolution!!! If you set a resolution in game, and exit the game, that game resolution will stay on windows, so you need change it in windows EVERY TIME. You cant change the resolution inside your game, it will restart your mission.  - Game wont minimize properly, even when it runs in windowed mode, it just wants to be on top (alt tab + random clicking did the trick once) - Game looks zoomed in/out on different resolutions. which is weird... 1080p too small (but i played it like that) 800x640 you can only see a small part of the map, it limits you on small resolutions. - NO BULLETS - i think this is a bug, some call it a feature. but when you get your gun, you get 6 bullets, and even if you load your save and you used a bullet before, bullet doesn't come back. There is no fix, i needed to get a bullet for the achievement, i used a gun a few times just to make the guards start searching or to start the sound detector. so i played the entire game from the start, and purchased a resolver at the end. (None of the tips and tricks i found online fix this problem) - Undo feature (to make you go back is useful ) but its weird at the same time, it just returns you sometimes in weird places/random times, one time 0 seconds, other times 60+seconds - Save feature sucks, lets say i finished a mission and started it again then aborted, it would just delete all my progress from before (no ladder boards, nothing to challenge me to do it better) Got on all maps a+ and im not satisfied.  Meh:  - Tools, i think developers were thinking, lets add more stuff just to add content, and lets add this gadget, and that gadget... most of the stuff is not even needed. you can finish the entire game just by using the jumping and rewire tool (even the last level, i successfully finished it without the door breaking thing, that the game said it was required). i used some tools just to get the achievement. ( I WOULD USE THEM MORE IF I HAD MANY BATTERIES TO USE THEM )  - Enemies, there are only 3 types of enemies, normal guard, tough guard, and elite guard. i would prefer if there were more enemies, with different abilities. - Maps, most of them are ok, but the only thing that challenged me for a few minutes was the last one map middle part puzzle (because of the resolution it took me a while to see what is going where) the rest are mostly simple. i would add some traps, for example if you make a mistake that the game locks you in a room (That happend only once to me on the last map) - Weird money system. i have no clue how much money will i get and what is rewarded the most, stealth, speed, killing, not killing?  - Cameras are there mostly to help me, and not the enemy.  Good stuff: - The gameplay is good, you can go full stealth ninja ghost :) or full psycho. - Story is ok - It has some humor - Workshop (level editor)  What would i add: - Bonus missions (Side missions) not related to the story, that could give me more batteries(and higher battery capacity), so that i could use the tools properly, and not just save them for the achievements. - More enemies as i said above (different enemies), lazy/sleeping guards, guards that dont move, maybe civilians.  - Maps that i would add, Monitor room, where guards would watch the cameras, and when i appear or rewire them they would go to inspect. Blocked rooms, where i cant use my rewire tool.  - I dont know, im just brainstorming  ...

https://steamcommunity.com/id/IgorDotNinja/recommended/220240,1, Really good game, i would give it 8 out of 10.   Good stuff:  * Open World * Storry is good, * Gameplay great * Missions Ok * Interesting and memorable characters * it has stealth elements  Bad stuff: * Controls, they complicated controls a lot, the simple stuff like movement is ok, but when you want to do takedowns, consume stuff, you need to hold the keys instead of short press. and in a lot of cases you do stuff that you dont want to, for example, i want to do a takedown and move back. but instead moving, i drag the body * I dont like the voice of the main character :D his voice is sometimes too girly and his friends/family are all ?????????s :D * Some minor bugs in game. * huge problem is the uplay, that is required. i would preffer steam.  Overall the game is fun, and i would recommend it to others. :)

https://steamcommunity.com/id/IgorDotNinja/recommended/209650,-1, Dont buy the game just because of the multiplayer (i have 77 hours of multiplayer)  Singleplayer works fine, and the story is ok :)   Multiplayer Review:  What i like about the multiplayer: The setting, the futuristic stuff, the sci fi stuff, the fast paced gameplay, the movement, the third dimension (maps are big and vertical also)   Problems i had with the game: ( i want to say that my pc is as good as recommended hardware, win10, everything updated, clean pc, dual monitors)  - The game is freezing, like a lot, unplayable, every 10 seconds or so, a half a second freeze. especially the game is freezing when the new map start, its is like insane, you cant even move right.  i thought it was a hardware problem, but it isnt, i have purchased a new gpu, the game works the same, the fix for this is to uninstall the game (remove it completely, verify integrity cache doesnt help) and then redownload all 50GB of the game. (i dont mind the download) but after a few days, the game starts freezing again, which drives you nuts. and if you want, you can repeat the process :D  - The game is crashing, yeah, for a lot, and for a lot of weird reasons.   1. not enough memory crash, i have 12GB of ram, and the game is crashing because i dont have enough memory, even if you have 64GB of RAM it will still crash and give you not enough memory message, Fix is, you need to enable PAGE FILE (i know, doesnt make any sense) set at least 2GB of virtual memory and the game will stop crashing with that error message. 2. the gpu crash, when the game crashes, the screen goes black, and you need to restart your pc, (enabling page file fixes this) i dont understand that one also.  3. the random crash, i have no idea, regular windows error closed this program... they happen from time to time, especially if you chat on steam (using the steam overlay) a lot when you play  - The game is lagging, i mean, when you play a faced paced game like this, everyone needs to have a good connection in order for a game to be ok, but that is not the issue 1. i can understand that after 1 year passes the game loses its players 2. there are no dedicated servers, so most of the time you are connected to some guy (who is the server)  3. half of the players have a bad connection to the server, 2 or 3 bars out of 4 (bars show how good the ping is) 4. most of the time i have 4 bars(max), and other people are like skipping frames, i see him here, then i see him there 5. in a fast paced game like this it is really hard to play like this  - DLC dont work right, i have purchased the extra slots for the armory, and it loaded only after a month (i tried to reinstall the game, switch it on off, restart stuff, it didnt help)   CONCLUSION   dont buy this game just because of the multiplayer

https://steamcommunity.com/id/IgorDotNinja/recommended/42680,-1, Game was great, and multi was awesome  BUT  i havent played for a while, and this year, i downloaded the multiplayer a couple of times,  and every f-ing time i started the game there was always a cheater or more on the server (and im not talking about a better player with really high score or something like that)  But some guy, giving headshots through walls as soon as you spawn, spinning people, spawning everybody on some place on the map in front of him... (it really sucks)  This last time, a guy was called Clone 1.1 (older dude, i would say 30+ by voice. he was the guy killing everyone on spawn) and he was saying on the voice chat about how he was angry at the cheaters, and he only wants to ruin games)  Cheaters are mostly in team deathmatch, but less of them are in free for all, i wanted to relax and play some dm.  i also encountered a couple of modded servers, which i dont mind if the mod is fun, but sometimes its like, care packages falling everywhere, 100 of them, and everyone can use them... insane.

Valve bundles people that are playing badly to people playing badly, meaning, you are never  going to be able to up your account or have a nice party if you have just started.  also mening that you will grow frustrated an in a disavantage from your friends that have been playing longer than you and were not subject to these tortures .  PLAY SOMETHING ELSE!  I have wasted a lot of money with skin and they will not give me a refund.  thta is the only reason I am still playing.   while I SEND MSGS TO VALVE ON A DAILY BASIS TO REVERT THE SITITUATION OR GET MY MONEY BACK I simply GET COMPLETELY IGNORE   AN ABUSIVE COMPANY THAT DO TAX FRAUD IN MANY COUNTRIES AND SHOULD BE SUEd BY THE PEOPLE!

(+) Runs Smooth @ Launch (+) Looks Amazing (+) Factions with truly, unique gameplay styles/abilitities/characters/perks/traits etc. (+) Epic Maps (+) DLC &quot;Coming Soon&quot;  (-) DLC &quot;Coming Soon&quot; (-) Characters can be too much, as in OP (-) Only 5 playable factions (-) Loading Times (SSD)  Would I recommend it?

https://steamcommunity.com/id/bencs/recommended/550,1, It's a game I used to play a lot, but then I stopped playing it a lot and now only play it a little. It's a game though.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198133427380/recommended/322500,1, This is a truly fun game. Really interesting premise and artstyle. Really intriguing to play with memorable sounds, it's like The Matrix except you're playing as the character who freezes bloody time itself. Nostalgic to go back into and offers a unique play-style. I'll put this into my rating system. I'm giving this a 7.8/10 The reason it's 7.8 and not 8 or 9 is because this game doesn't offer much variety, you're stuck with this one play-style and tactics remain awfully similar. The story itself is also really..&quot;meh.&quot;

https://steamcommunity.com/id/phantompanther/recommended/346900,1, A rather simple idle game that you can run in the background while you're doing other things.  Not the most exciting game on Steam, but it can be oddly fun from time to time and there's quite a bit of silly humor involved.  There's not really much point to it, but it can give you something to click around on while thinking or trying to pass the time.  It's free to play and can basically be played without spending any real cash, but there are slow points and the events will likely give players a bit of trouble, since they are only available to play for a limited time ( some of them do come back around, but with everything reset ).  It does try to encourage you to spend real money, which may bother some players, but it doesn't really bother me.  I have yet to spend any money, although I would like to, and generally do okay, but it takes quite a long time to build up enough resources to complete planets. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198133427380/recommended/871720,1, It¡¯s free...... But for me it¡¯s like 50.00000001% recommended, the characters (animatronics) look silly when they jump-scare, there¡¯s not much story so what¡¯s even the point? The game is challenging and ¡°fun?¡± I guess, quite a lot of replay value.....overall just a solid ¡®strategy-based, point-click horror game¡± that focuses more on strategy and technique than horror.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/WorxyisHere/recommended/730,-1, So after playing this game for almost 6 years (Keep in mind, This isn't my first account and I did got the game actually back on it's first week of release in 2012) But anyway, It's time to be honest and show my actual opinion about the game at the current state (As of April 2018). CS GO was something very special to me as this was the first game to show me the competitive side of many different games and gave me the courage to transition from games like CoD and BF and pretty much became a part of me overtime as it made me to think differently about the way that games can be played but as some people say &quot;All good things must come to an end!&quot; isn't? Here it ends.  As the time passed on. We can see that Valve barely supports the game and this can be noticed by the lack of proper updates to the game and less listening to it's community. The promise in 2017 for the Panorama UI? It's almost mid 2018 and still nothing about it The matchmaking being at it's worst state like it's never been like before Lack of new maps and operations, Some of you may remember that we had 2-3 operations a year? Now we are barely getting only 1 a year (That's if we are lucky enough to get). 5vs5 unranked matchmaking (With a sort of hidden Normal MMR)? Nope The option to play on official MM with 128tick? Nope, Rely on 3rd party services to do so No Server selection? Come on Valve, Even Dota2 does that... And I can continue with the list but why I should do it? You already got the point I guess so.  Overall, I still would be playing CS from time to time but however. I cannot recommend this game anymore for new players at the current state. I really hope that Valve would take some things into consideration and would improve over time. It was fun while it lasted but not anymore. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/KTFoxen/recommended/268910,1, It's an amazing original masterpiece 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/makhodayari/recommended/230410,1, What a game, OMG. First time I played I really didn't expect this Can't stop playing. Also have to say the last update (Plains of Eidolon) is AWESOME. A must play game. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/WorxyisHere/recommended/359550,1, People are going to ask me &quot;Dude, How the hell you can review this game when you got less than 100 hours?&quot; and I actually can understand you at some point but this is my first impression from the game.  As the time passed on, I pretty much got bored of playing CS GO all the time and really wanted to find a new game that based on similar concept and my friend told me &quot;You really should try R6S&quot;, For sure, CS GO is not the same as R6S but they pretty much got one thing in common. It requires a lot of strategy and teamwork in order to win matches.  Gameplay : By my own experience. Most of the time. The gameplay was feeling kinda slow but that's how it's supposed to be I guess as this game requires strategy and careful planning or you pretty much going to die and you know that you did a huge mistake and as a result you got punished by the game.But at the same time it feels rewarding since you learning from it and trying not to do the same thing again.  Community : I have already experienced lots of toxicity and many other things from different games that I'm playing at the moment such as CS GO, Overwatch and League of Legends and I thought it would be quite the same on R6S as well. Well, I was actually really surprised. Now of course nobody is going to avoid toxicity since people with anger management issues would play the game and I have met some toxic people on this game but most of the time I have got matched with people who actually know how to play the game and also being very helpful for the new players. You know how good it is to meet people who act as human beings after coming back from a game with toxic people?  Graphics and optimization : When I hear that a game is made by Ubisoft, My thought is going to be &quot;Ohh damn, another broken game with lots of performance issues&quot; but it was really far away from what I thought. I'm playing on i7 4790 and GTX 1070 on the Maxed out settings (With the Ultra HD textures as well) with the T-AA and indeed can maintain above 144FPS without any problem and the game indeed looks well  In conclusion, I really looking forward to keep playing this game in the future and would try a bit the competitive match-making really soon (Would update the review about it later on) and have to say that Ubisoft did here a great job with the game and indeed improved it overtime and kudos to the devlopers of the game about it! I can without any doubt recommend this game for people who are looking for a strategic game that they can enjoy for a long time.  Competitive MM : It took quite some time for me to decide how the MM is, Each game has it's own flaws but the MM does have some really serious issues that make the competitive mode to look like a joke and yes, I'm mostly talking about leavers. The penalties are pretty much worthless and doesn't do anything in order to prevent players from leaving the matches. 15 minutes for each penalty (May be fine for the first cooldown) isn't enough by any means. And some matches can be frustrating not because of a poor teamwork but when you have to start the game as 4vs5 or even worse in some games. When a person disconnects in the first round. it should offer to the team the option (Like a remake that exists on LoL) if they want to continue the match or shut it down and only the leaver would get a lose. But when everything is going as it should be (Getting a great teammates or going with your premades), Then indeed the competitive is worth it and can provide a lot of great time.  Overall rating : 8/10 18/1/2018: Added &quot;Competitive MM&quot; (Sorry if it looks like a rant)

And the single player is a glorified tutorial.  Do not buy this game, its a way for ubisoft to take your money.  The game DOES NOT WORK. It is NOT READY yet.   Absolute Rip off not worth 60 euros

https://steamcommunity.com/id/MidnyghtBalance/recommended/306130,-1, Als ich den cinematic Trailer das erste mal sah, gekoppelt mit der Erinnerung an TES Skyrim dachte ich mir sofort,??????das muss ich haben!! Dann erfuhr ich, dass es monatliche Kosten beinhaltet und da war ich sofort raus. Doch dann wurden die monatlichen Kosten abgeschafft und ich dachte mir, ja warum nicht. Ich kaufte mir das Spiel in der Erwartung, es w¨¹rde ?hnlich gut wie TES Skyrim werden, eben nur online, doch ich wurde herbe entt?uscht. Ich spielte bis ungef?hr lvl 25 von ich glaube 80lvls und das leveln dauerte mir verh?ltnism??ig zu lange, weshalb ich dann auch aufgeh?rt hab.  Negativ: -Kein richtiges Matchmaking-System f¨¹r Dungeons, man kann zwar nach Gruppen suchen, jedoch kam bei der Suche nie was raus ...Ich erinnere an Matchmaking-Systeme wie in Destiny, die wesentlich einfacher geregelt sind. -Es dauert gef¨¹hlt ewig bis ich das erste mal nach Himmelsrand konnte, da dort ein lvl 40 Gebiet existierte...und mit lvl 20 bedeutete das den sicheren Tod, schade... -Die Quests waren bisher weder eine Herausforderung, noch besonders Interessant. Gehe dahin, t?te das, gehe dahin, t?te andere Viecher,...laaaangweilig -PVP ist ein Witz, komplett Cyrodiil ist eine PVP Karte, exakt nach dem Schema von Guild Wars 2, drei B¨¹ndnisse k?mpfen auf mehreren Parallelen Maps des gleichen Aufbaus um den Besitz von Festungen, Geh?ften,... Sagt mir leider ¨¹berhaupt nicht zu und mich auch noch mit Leuten die gesch?tzt 13 sind rumschlagen zu m¨¹ssen, die meinten sie m¨¹ssten das Team anf¨¹hren, ne danke, da bin ich raus. -Entweder man bezahlt trotzdem monatlich und erh?lt daf¨¹r Kronen mit denen man diverses Premiumzeug kaufen kann, wie Pferde, Haustiere,... oder man bricht sich einen ab bei dem Versuch sich die Sachen auch ohne Premium zu besorgen. -Die Welt erzeugt nicht ann?hernd so viel Atmosph?re wie TES Skyrim und das ist mein Hauptkritikpunkt, der sich durch alles im Spiel zusammensetzt, sowohl PVP als auch PVE. -Der Anfang des Spiels war so langweilig und ?de, dass ich schon da keinen Bock auf den Rest der &quot;Story&quot; hatte und die auch nicht in einem Rutsch durchmachen konnte, keine Ahnung was das soll...  Weder positiv noch negativ: oAus den F?higkeiten, die man aus verschiedenen Gebieten erwerben kann, sucht man sich 6 inklusive einer ultimativen Fertigkeit und kann dann nur diese gleichzeitig benutzen, will man eine andere F?higkeit, muss man ins Men¨¹ und wechseln.  oMan w?hlt man Anfang aus verschiedenen Klassen, was mich zuerst sehr ¨¹berrascht hat, weil es garnicht an TES erinnert. Das f¨¹hrt mich jedoch in eine bestimmte Richtung was meinen Charakter angeht und macht es leichter, jedoch weniger Flexibel.  Positiv: +Die Landschaft sieht nach TES aus. Gef?llt mir!  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/MidnyghtBalance/recommended/261640,-1, Ich schreibe hier als jemand, der bereits die ersten beiden Teile ewig lange durchgezockt hat und dem es nicht langweilig wurde, durch eine gut gestaltete Story und Charaktere unterhalten zu werden.  In dem Spiel geht es um Athena, eine Kopfgeldj?gerin, die fr¨¹her in den Diensten von Handsome Jack stand und diesem half die Hyperionbasis Helios zur¨¹ckzuerobern. Dies berichtet sie in der Gefangenschaft von Lilith, Tiny Tina, Brick und den anderen Charakteren aus Teil 2.   Der erste Eindruck:  An der Grafik hat sich nichts getan, und das sollte es auch nicht, typisch Borderlands eben.  Im Prinzip die gleichen Gegnertypen wie in Teil 1 und 2, Kraggons, Banditen (heissen jetzt Scavs, dementsprechend sind auch die ehemaligen Banditwaffen jetzt von Scav), Shuguraths, Weltraumraider (Typen mit Raumanz¨¹gen) und Rakks, das wars auch schon.  Slagwaffen durch Cryowaffen ersetzt, f¨¹r mich geht das garnicht. Als ich h?rte es gibt neue Elemente und Waffen w?re ich nicht darauf gekommen man w?re so drei?t einfach ein Element zu ersetzen. Die perlescenten und die Seraph Waffen  wurden beide entfernt, klar dass ich mir das nochmal mit den den 30 Euro!!!! teueren DLCs kaufen darf. Die neuen Laserwaffen wurden eingef¨¹hrt, f¨¹r mich eines der wenigen positiven Neuerungen. Drei Lasertypen, mit viel Potential neue einzigartige Waffen zu kreiiren. Die neuen Waffendesigns, bei den Scavwaffen und Mondscheinwaffen anzutreffen, finde ich optisch sehr gut. die legend?ren Waffen, also gef¨¹hlt 10 legend?re des letzten Teils, leicht abge?ndert und einen neuen Namen draufgestempelt und die paar neuen legend?ren Waffen sind relativ in Ordnung. Waffen aus den vorigen Teilen zu ¨¹bernehmen ist mir durchaus bekannt, jedoch gibt es meiner Meinung nach viel zu wenig neue legend?re Waffen, wie ich es im Vergleich zu Teil 2 kenne. Das Schwerkraftfeature, naja f¨¹r mich nicht sonderlich interessant, aber eine interessante Idee. Die Bosse, fr¨¹her wurden echt badassig vorgestellt, hier sind alle ein schlechter Witz, schlechte Charaktere und keine bisschen interessant. Kein bisschen Badass zu sehen, da w¨¹nsche ich mir sofort wieder Brick aus Teil 1 und 2. W?hrend des ganzen Spiels habe ich maximal 5 mal lachen m¨¹ssen, ebenfalls ein (schlechter) Witz im Vergleich zu den Teilen davor.  Die Charaktere sind allesamt in Ordnung und weitestgehend von den alten abgegrenzt, f¨¹r mich leider trotzdem nicht besonders reizvoll, mir gefielen die vorherigen Klassen um einiges besser.  Die Story ist in Ordnung, wobei ich nach dem &quot;vermeintlichen&quot; Ende feststellen durfte, das es noch weiter geht, was sich allerdings sehr gezogen hat und nicht besonders reizvoll war. Das Levelcap wieder auf 50 zu setzen ist eine Frechheit, pure Geldmacherei um den Leuten wieder die 4 DLCs  f¨¹r 30 Euro aufs Auge zu dr¨¹cken. Abschliessend meine Bewertung: Es fehlt der Charakter der vorigen Teile fast komplett, das Design blieb erhalten, jedoch ohne das Gef¨¹hl es wirklich mit Borderlands zu tun zu haben. Dinge zu ersetzen , siehe Cryowaffen, geht ¨¹berhaupt nicht, ebenso wie die Neuerungen der DLCs aus Teil 2 wieder mit neuen DLCs einf¨¹hren zu m¨¹ssen. Ich hab an jeder Stelle die alte Besetzung der Charaktere vermisst, Dr. Zed als Mediziner, Markus als Waffenverk?ufer, Scooter als Autobastler,.... Die ganze Besetzung eben, inklusive der Moxxi aus den Teilen davor. Die l?cherlichen Bosse (siehe : Godzilla Abklatsch, der Bootsmann, der Endgegner, dieses fliegende Raumschif,...) sind in Kombination mit den wenigen neuen legend?ren Waffen ein kritischer Treffer in meine Magengegend. Die gegen Ende ¨¹berzogene Story hat es fast geschafft mir Borderlands zu zerst?ren. Definitiv der schlechteste Teil der Reihe bisher, ich bereue den Kauf sogar. Die 76 Punkte von Metacritic finde ich noch extrem gro?z¨¹gig. Ich h?tte nichtmal 70 Punkte f¨¹r diese Frechhheit gegeben, ich bleibe lieber weiterhin bei Teil 2!!! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/afarnsworth/recommended/57400,1, Great sequel. The combat is mostly unchanged (that's a good thing) but there are a few nice improvements, and more variety in the enemies.  This game is a lot bigger than the first, but I do feel like the locations in this game were a little less memorable.  The new flying/gliding mechanics are fun, some cool new gadgets &amp; gadget features, craftier riddler challenges, side quests, and a lot of excitement. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/MidnyghtBalance/recommended/570,-1, Even though the game offers a great concept, the community is just completely ????????. If you dont play ranked or at least with friends, the game can be very nice. If you dont have other people to play with and choose ranked, youre gonna have a bad time. When people DONT??????on the roles that a team should have, theyre either stupid or just suck...sometimes even all of them. Communication is mostly non existent and everybody thinks is right. Russians who manage to disconnect in almost every game, brits who are toxic for no reason and mostly suck even more than the rest...its just ???????t and when you have a 5 game losing streak because you keep getting the same guys over and over again in your team and they still dont care or make any effort to win, feed, take the carries farm, dont know how to support(stack, harass and help your carry, how hard can that be...) or even dont care at all you just want to quit on this game. When your team is down by at least 50 kills after 20 mins you always get those wannabe rockys in your team who refuse to give up and waste the next 5 mins getting???????the same way as the 20 mins before, its just insane.  Oh and almost forgot, you also get sent to low prio when you have multiple ??????? who fit in all of those patterns above in your team reporting you, isnt that great? I know i played this game for already 2000 hours and im a really good support, but when braindead idiots cant play carry and only manage to get to 13k networth after 30 mins this is just a joke...

https://steamcommunity.com/id/cakesale/recommended/225080,1, Awesome little game. At first I thought I had changed a language setting somehow  but soon realised that this game portrayed it's meaning of words using the expressions and gestures of the characters. It has a very interesting use of the controller and it takes a little while to get used to controlling the two brothers. This really is a great experience. My hand has never felt so alone. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/afarnsworth/recommended/653530,1, A very unique game.  I can only assume by 2021 the indie game market will be packed full of time travelling whodunnit insurance simulators.
