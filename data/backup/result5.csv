https://steamcommunity.com/id/unkn0wn_g/recommended/268050,1,   Bad image and horrible release, but great game!   My favorite survival horror game so far.  The graphics are nice, even tho the development of the game started in the era of the PS3. Many people told me that the controls are bad on PC with mouse/keyboard,  but I didn't encounter any problems, infact I enjoyed it more then with the PS4/Steam controller.  The game is a 3rd person shooter that tells you the Story of Detective Sebastian Castellanos, who's trying to solve the mystery of his missing wife and daughter. The story ist one of the best parts of the game, and is getting more interesting, the more you play.  The stealth elements on the other hand... Are a nightmare. The AI is dump  and the sneaking controls aren't flawless. But the worst part is the camera... I managed to beat the game by shooting my way throu, but the ammo is limited so you have to take adventag of traps and use your surroundings to save ammo.  The headshots feel extremly satisfying and the overall hit-registartion and feedback is great! You can upgade all your weapons and even yourself, HP / Stamina / CQC etc.  The sound is good and the soundtrack... OH MY GOD THE SOUNDTRACK! They did an amazing job and the outro song &quot;Long way down&quot; is now in my Spotify playlist.  On the release the game was full of bugs, had a 30 fps lock and big black bars, it all got fixed and the game is perfectly enjoyable.  Thing's, it's a horror game at the beginning. But once you saw all the different enemy-types and their weaknesses, upgreaded ur guns and feel more confident, it feels like and action game with jumpscares here and there.  I love the game anyway, and the 2 DLC's, &quot;Assignment&quot; and &quot;Consequens&quot; are waaaaay more scary. Seriously, way more scarier that the base-game.  I'd rate this game a solid 8/10.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008795719/recommended/289070,1, Though the game was definitely bare in its initial release, the Rise and Fall expansion makes Civilization VI one of the greatest in the series. As a longtime Civilization player (roughly 11 years now) I judge these games pretty harshly. I was releuctant at first to accept the new city-building feature of the game, but as my 225+ hours of gameplay will tell you, I quickly fell in love. As perhaps the biggest change to the game, it has added a new dimension to Civilization, changing it just enough to keep it interesting but not so much that the game is unrecognizable *glares accusingly at Civilization Beyond Earth*. The game has been great for a Civilization veteran like me as well as my rookie friends. I anxiously await the next expansion. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/snips_/recommended/289070,1, Sure, there are still plenty of negative reviews for this and they can have that opinion. And I'll admit that I agree with some of those points that they bring up. However, for an overall opinion mine is positive. Sure, the AI still are a bit problematic, but that is due to change when Gathering Storm goes live. The way I see it now, buying this game is an investment for those on the fence.  One problem that I do have with those that directly compare VI to V is that this game is still being updated and has its second DLC coming up (Gathering Storm) and V is completed with its two (Gods &amp; Kings and Brave New World). When V first went live, I felt that IV was better. People forget that V started with combat units having a 10 hp pool and G&amp;K brought that up to 100.  What I'm saying is that while the current game (at that time that I'm writing this) is not perfect but Rising Storm has the potential to improve it significantly.  tl:dr- Buy as investment for future DLCs and stop comparing a game with known future updates to a game that is finished.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/unkn0wn_g/recommended/289070,-1, So yeah, I really didn't knew if I should write a positive or negative review, I decided to not recommend the game, and that's why:  It's overpraised af. The game itself maybe doesn't seem so, but 30ву for a DLC that adds so little to the game. Or the new expansion pack coming out soon, 40ву! Wtf?! 40ву for an expansion pack! Who tf is responsible for the marketing?! 5ву for a new Civ and a scenario??  Also I don't like the cartoony style, I liked the one from Civ V much better. I see what they tried to do with that whole district thing, make the cities bigger and make it feel more lived-in, but it doesn't really work and is rather annoying imo. Also, the unexplored area is kinda beige-colored, while the area that is explored, but not in the range of vision is a brighter beige with a little transparency, and the overall game looks yellow-orangy. I don't know how many times I was sending my scouts to an already explored area cuz of that, I had to download the Civ V Clouds mod to fix that.  That being said, the mods feel much more stable then on Civ V, I had like 3-4 crashes on my 60h, and that's not too bad I guess.  The rest of the game really just feels like Civ V with &quot;brave new world&quot; and &quot;gods and kings&quot; already build in. Witch is not really a bad thing, and after you get used to the district system, it's actually quite fun. The first 20h I was hating the game really much, but now it feels enjoyable. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/271900,1, This is the follow-up to a nice casual puzzle game. It still reminds you a of the classic minesweeper game on Windows with some additional ways to calculate moves.  Hexcells Plus does seem to force a bit more &quot;guessing&quot; this time around.  Replayability is a bit low as there are no random puzzles.  However, this is still a fun diversion that you can complete within a few hours. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/snips_/recommended/235580,1, This DLC made Civ V into the great game that it is currently. The tourism mechanic is another way to achieve that sneaky victory over your opponents. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/snips_/recommended/8930,1, The only problem that I had with this game was that I played it too much. It's the standard with the Civilizaton series and after way too much time spent playing, I still found myself logging a few more hours daily. Currently it has fallen to the wayside because of Civ VI, but if I had leftover room in my memory, I'd reinstall this without a second thought. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/465650,1, OOTP18 is the latest version of a great baseball simulator.  I noticed two significant changes from OOTP16 (last version that I owned).  First, the 3D view of the game.  Pervious versions that I played was basically text-only with minimal graphical reflections of the action.  This addition is a very nice touch and aligns with the play-by-play text that is presented.  Since I tend to play all the games (not sim), I have enjoyed this feature much  more than I would have thought.  Another little nuance that I thought was great is after a completed game, there is a nice recap of the game along with player &quot;quotes&quot; and a probability of winning line as the game progressed.  The other significant change that I found is the new &quot;challenge mode.&quot;  Although this does not fundamentally change the game, you can now compare your results to the other OOTP18 players out there.  Challenge mode restricts a couple things in the game (e.g. player editor, long-term simulation), but does enable your score to be recorded against other players.  These two changes were worth getting OOTP18.    For those that are unfamiliar with the series, OOTP18 is a baseball game for all of the armchair GMs and Managers that are out there.  This is the third iteration that I have played (OOTP16 and OOTP10) and the game continues to evolve very well.  As with the pervious couple of versions, OOTP has the MLB and Player's Association license.  As a sports fan, you always wonder about how you would remake your favorite team into a dynasty and now is your chance.  You start with the ability to manage a MLB team today or any year from 1871.  You may also choose one of several International Leagues that are available.  From day one, you can delegate authority to the AI or control everything.  From the GM perspective, this includes player and staff contracts, free agent signings, major/minor league roster moves, drafts, trades, and organizational budget allocations.  From the manager perspective, you set your pitching rotations and lineups.  At that point, you can dive into playing each baseball game or sim through the days.  All the statistics from MLB history is available and its fun starting from scratch in 1871 to learn about the early pioneers in baseball.  The other great thing about the OOTP series is the ability to create your own fictional leagues, uniforms, and designs with the large user-mod community.  The bottom line is that this game is a must have for people who love baseball. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/208400,1, This is a game for those who want to experience the nostalgic turn-base RPG.  For those familiar with Ultima IV (1985 release), Avernum will bring back those fond memories.  In Escape from the Pit, you control up to four party members who have been banished from the Empire.  From that seed, the storyline will grow.  Since this is a relaunch of the Avernum series, the graphics are kept simple, but effective and plays efficiently on much older systems.  Combat is turn-base with turns accomplished sequentially by intitiative and party order.  The story is interesting with plenty of side quests and dungeons/caves to crawl around and explore.  There is plenty of content since as of this review, I'm over 12 hours in and have covered around 1/3 of the map.  Bottom line is that this is a fun turn-base RPG.  It's a must for the fans of Ultima IV. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/259060,1, My impressions of Dominions 4 (~15 hours) is that Illwinter has come up with another winner.  Be warned though, this is a game for folks who really enjoy turn-based strategy games (TBS), especially multi-player TBS (Disclaimer:  I have not tried Dominions 4 MP yet, but Dominions 3 MP was tremendous).  But if you are looking for high-end graphics, a gentle learning curve, hand-holding tutorials or a casual strategy gaming experience, you may want to look elsewhere.   However, if you are a fan of TBS games, Dominions 4 has tremendous depth, content and attention to detail.  From the ability to customize your god to each race with unique abilities, there are many variables to make each game unique.  Gameplay can be a bit daunting initially, but rewards players who carefully plan and execute those strategies.  My only negative at this time regarding Dominions 4 is it appears to be a bit too similar to Dominions 3 which I played heavily in the pre-Steam days.  Iбпll update this review after additional playtime with other factions and MP to highlight some of the changes from Dominions 3.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/234330,1, Second update based on R78 build (Season 16 timeframe).  The updates since R74 have resolved the PvP portion of the game.  PvP match-ups are now working quite a bit better.  The PvE portion of the game has also improved by giving better opportunities for mid-tier heroes (i.e. not maxed out) to be successful in the overall standings.  I have also noticed the max lives has increased to 10 (from 5).  I'm not sure if that is temporary or not, but that change enables someone to play extended gaming sessions without having to wait to get more lives which should enable new folks to enjoy the game more as they develop their characters. ----- Previously posted negative update: Update based on R74 build (Season 13 timeframe).  The recent changes to the game have made the pvp portion of the game impossible for anyone that does not have a maxed out team.  Previously, the match-ups were based on the number of points you had in the event and you could spend some good gaming time in each event.  Now, after 1-2 battles, your team will face maxed or nearly maxed teams making pvp impossible for players that have not maxed their heroes out (i.e. pay to improve them).  This was a very unfortuante design change that will likely kill off participation in this game. ----- Previously posted positive review: Review based on R55 build (Season 3-4 timeframe).  Marvel Puzzel Quest is fun, casual game similar to the other Puzzle Quest &quot;match-3&quot; type of games with characters from the Marvel Universe.  Like the earlier Puzzle Quest games, there is an added element of strategy on the matches you make based on the strengths of your team of 3 heroes and the strengths of the opposing team.  Although it seems simple in concept, this game is just as addicting as the previous versions of Puzzle Quest.   On the negative side for folks just starting out is the &quot;countdown&quot; timer for your characters to &quot;heal.&quot;  This isn't as big of a deal later on when you have more characters or if you play the game in short periods of time (~30 minutes).    A common question on the Free-to-Play games is whether or not they are Pay-to-Win.  Puzzle Quest can be done without paying anything if you follow a couple of guidelines.    First, you have to accept being limited to a smaller number of characters (known as covers).  If you want more covers early, then an in-game purchase is likely needed ($5-$20 depending on how many characters you want).  Second, if you are new to the game, you are not going to finish high in the rankings on the special events (Lightning Round, Simulator, Seasons).  That will take time to level up your characters or some in-game purchases to level up faster.   Third, be patient.  If you spend all your &quot;healing&quot; and want to keep playing, an in-game purchase is needed.  If you are patient, then the characters eventually get back to full strength an no purchase is necessary.  Bottom line is that this is a fun game that can be played for free.  In my opinion based, the game does provide enough entertainment and gameplay to justify an in-game purchase or two ($5-$20).

I wish I could get 153 of them back.. then refund this POS where it belongs.   Just play Civ 5.. it's pretty much how people compared Morrowind (civ5) to Oblivion (civ6).   It could of been great, but I have no idea what the hell and how much the reviewers from legit gaming sites came to such high scores. Unless that is, they were completely new to the franchise and or turn-based strategy. Just walk away. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/killijin/recommended/292030,1, The current steam badge promotion was the last nail in my motivation to write a review for this open-world sandbox RPG, near masterpiece. Having a huge backlog has prevented me from playing this game until recently and now that I have, I am sad that I waited. Once I saw it on sale for 19.99 for the complete edition, that was enough to make me jump in feet first. It also does not hurt that I a make an effort to collect and play the vast majority of overwhelmingly positively reviewed games and this so happens to be among the elite. With that said lets proceed..   Gameplay: 8.5/10 - This game, along with most 3rd person games, is best played with a controller, I prefer an xbone controller but YMMV. PC purists be damned, I am a pc purist, and it's just more engaging, easier, and overall more comfortable to be played with a decent dual-stick analog controller. Each button is perfectly placed and is fully utilized on said xbone controller.  Once  you get the hang of the physics and combat engine, it pretty much plays like a grounded assassins creed/batman arkham series game. Counters, crossbows, swords, axes, magic, bombs, all work together in a seamless orchestra of monster-killing mayhem. You can pretty much tailor your character to playing a certain class be it, mage, warrior, etc. but it requires points through levling and points found throughout the world in the form of places of power to fully realize any class base. So take it as Geralt is, a warlock, a spellsword. A jack-of-all trades, a master of three things, ?????? (plenty of sexual situations), monster slaying, and a quaint yet highly engaging/engrossing collectable in-game, card game called Gwent. Which as far as I know has evolved into something grander and played online as well. I find myself always looking for new matches, repeat matches, and playing wherever and whenever I can in the game. The A.I. is tough but fair and you will develop new strategies by repeat failures and victories. A keystone of any great card game.  I find the combat engaging and although it is repetetive, the variations between potions, the monsters, bombs, etc. all help it to remain fresh throughout the full course of the game, one that I have 184 hours in, haven't beaten, is still in Skellige and still has 2 expansions to do. I am a completionist though, so you can expect at least 160 hours with both expansions with small side-quest exploration and a &quot;normal&quot; sense of exploration. As I stated, I am completionist, so I visit and do EVERYTHING, so again, expect great value for any price really even upwards to 59.99. I rarely say that about any game, so for what it is worth coming from a gaming veteran of 30 years take that as you may. Back to the topic, the thing that makes up for all of the game's, &quot;short-comings,&quot; is it's beyond-the-pale story-writing and fully voiced voice acting. Heavily drawn from the books and a lovingly respect from Polish culture, this story plays out in an interwoven tale of humanity, fantasy, fiction and non-fiction. All without butting heads with one another. A story that quickly sucked me in, being that I am American, one part because it was foreign, but also because it was so familiar. Something similar in reference to The Wolf Among Us, where the setting and telling of the story was so radically different yet you connected to it because it was still so familiar, and that is in no small part to the stellar writing being used here. Then there are the quests, and the quests that open because of that quest, and then the world is changed because you made x decision on that quest. I love stuff like that. Where you expect a finite quest and then wait... there's more! Now, there are valid complaints with the game itself but mostly cosmetic but they need discussed regardless. I will touch more upon them in upcoming review categories as that is when they are more applicable. * more to come soon* thanks for reading and I hope you decide to jump in.

The art style is great with quirky/odd music and  well done.  Both fit the game world well. The story line is humorous with a strange &quot;love story&quot; with a couple of twists thrown in.  Puzzles and mini-games were east to moderate difficulty, although some combinations were a bit on the strange side.   Completing the game for experienced adventurers would be around 10-12 hours for the first run through.  For achievement seekers, the last one needs to be done with the sound turned off or you will go insane!  The last achievement is a bit of a challenge if you try it, but easier if you just finished the game and have a good memory.  Bottom line is that this was a fun, short adventure that I am looking forward to playing the sequels.

I've always enjoyed the empire building throughout the eras and this version continues my enjoyment of this series.  This review includes updates through the Rise and Fall DLC.  As with the more recent entries, the DLC makes a significant impact on the game and I expect future DLC will continue to strengthen the gameplay.   For newcomer to the series, Civ is a turn-based strategy game.  In the beginning, you must start building your empire from scratch, gathering resources to build, expand, and protect your empire.  As you explore the world, you'll find new resources while your technology improves to allow new structures and new military units and even great wonders of the world.  You will meet other cultures and leaders.  The question is whether you can build a civilization that the stand the test of time.  For veterans of the series, Civ VI biggest change from previous versions was how the cities are built.  In Civ VI, each new building, zone or improvement has to go on a specific tile. This changes some of the city building stratgy that leads to a more focused build for the cities which even impacts the type of Wonders you may want at a particular location. This sort of decision making is what makes Civ VI amazing.  But as with new changes, it has caused a bit of a drawback.  At this point, the AI doesn't do well with this added dimension.  Even at the Deity leve (most difficult), the AI is still overmatched. However, the patches and DLCs continue to improve the game and the AI and I believe by the end, Civ VI will be even greater than the final version of Civ V.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/8930,1, As an experienced Civ series player, Civ V had a rough start initially and was inferior to the expanded version of Civ IV.  However, just as Civ IV progressed, so did Civ V through the years.  This review reflects Civ V with the 2 expansions (Gods and Kings and Brave New World).  Once again, we face the &quot;Just one more turn&quot; syndrome that this game has always provided.  This 4x turn-based strategy game continues to evolve by enhancing the multiple victory conditions for the game.  Many scenarios are available and the Steam Workshop for Civ now creates easily assessible mods for the game to increase replayability.  The AI still makes strategic mistakes, but evens out a bit at the higher difficulty levels due to AI bonuses/player penalties,  The end-game has greatly improved over previous iterations of the series due to the enhancements to diplomatic and cultural victory conditions.  The replayability and replayability of Civ V is so good, that I will nitpick on a couple of areas for improvement (and mods are out that resovle this too).  Those improvement areas are to make the different cultures even more unique (more unique looks between the cultures) and speeding up the preformance on huge maps.  Otherwise, this Civ V with the DLCs is an excellent game that will take up just one more turn.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/333820,1, OOTP16 is the baseball game for all of the armchair GMs/Managers out there.  There have been quite a few improvements to OOTP since my last purchase (OOTP10) and the obvious change is the MLB license.  For those unfamiliar with the series, this is a TEXT based game with visuals to generally represent the action.  Once you are hired by your team, you control almost everything (after your budget allocation from the owner).  As the GM, you can directly control (or delegate to the AI) player and staff contracts, FA signing, roster promotions/demotions, trades and even ticket prices.   Then as the manager, you set your pitching rotation and lineups and play ball.  From there, itбпs up to you if you want to play the game days or simulate through them and just be the GM.  Finally, there is a ton of flexibility with historical years and statistics of the entire MLB history from 1871.  Pick a season to start and alter history.  Or you can create a completely fictional league to play.  A large user community already exists with entire fictional leagues, uniforms and players that are ready to download and import if you are interested.  Who would like this game: Folks who want to be the GM of their favorite team and enjoy baseballбпs rich statistics.    Who would NOT like this game: Folks who want high end graphics and real-time in-game action (stick to the very good console baseball games).

https://steamcommunity.com/id/unkn0wn_g/recommended/629520,1, It's really simple, just drag and drop a sound file into Soundpad, bind it to a key and press the key while ur speaking (u have to hold the push to talk key and then press your sound-hotkey). It's easy to use and high quality with NO limitations. 9/10! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/medve5/recommended/675010,1, After 50 hours of gameplay, completed all 9 challenges, completed all 7 maps on hardcore with original vehicles, tried out lot of mods.  Compared to the original Spintires:  Pros: - Game is still fun - Graphics looks nicer - Game runs better - Challenge mode is pretty fun but short - They added some new vehicles - Finally Cockpit view - Original maps got some nice reworks - Not abandoned like the original Updates and two Free DLC - New centered camera - Map support in the workshop  Cons: - There are no 13 new vehicles (but there are some) - There is a cockpit view but it is ugly and mostly useless without working mirrors - Wheel and Tire options are removed, Less truck attachments - Uncomfortable Winch and Cruise control - 60 Fps lock - Running in 32 bit - Other bugs  Summary: - I changed this review from Negative to Positive because they release some decent updates - Cockpit view is still ugly and very basic, mostly useless :( Needs major improvement!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/HadrianLP/recommended/305620,1,   A quintessentially rare experience in today's gaming world   An exquisite survival title in which a man's (or woman's) only obstacles are hunger, thirst, exhaustion, a few angry wolves or irritable bears, and the bitter, bitter cold of Hinterland Studios' apocalyptic vision. Sounds simpler than genre average, right?   Good luck to you.  - бк -    A May, 2017 Early Access Review бк The Long and Short of It  (TL;DR at Bottom)  ***  A few things for the record. First, I have owned this game since early summer, 2015, meaning I have been with the game since there was only one region (Mystery Lake) and the Desolation Point, Timberwolf Mountain, Tireless Menace, Penitent Scholar, and Resolute Outfitter content patches had yet to arrive. Second, I have produced ~100 hours of monetized YouTube content featuring this title and continue to add to that number as an ardent devotee of the game, its developer, and its community. Some may see that as a biasing factor (though I have never had any &quot;skin in the game&quot; beyond my own content).   Let me make a quick note regarding the tone of the community &amp; some of the other reviews at this moment in time.   If it's May 2017 and you are just looking into this game for the first time , it's good for you to be objective &amp; aware of two very important things. (1) This game's story mode, its crowning patch and mark of completion, has been a long time coming, and (2) its fans are really, really, looking forward to it. They want it  badly . Even if they seem not to sometimes.  To be clear, I'm not an angry fan. I have always highly recommended this game at all stages in its development, and have no problem publicly professing my disdain for the throngs of players that are brazenly pushing a hyperbolicбкand often dishonestбкnarrative toward the public eye about the villainy of Hinterland for daring not to cave to pressure and to take the time to get this masterpiece right.  Without going too far down that rabbit hole... what to make of all that frustration?  It's straightforward. The anticipation for August's (!!) Story Mode releaseбкand don't believe everything you read; this month marks the first time Hinterland have ever announced a definite release dateбкhas been drawn out over so long, and has been intensified by multiple new, ambitious additions to the game's original vision by a small, self-funded team that has fought hard to make it to this landmark point in development...  ...that people are  JUST a little bit out of their senses .  Just remember that when you're looking at all the vitriol-laced rants that have been popping up the week I'm writing this. People are angry because, after more than two years in early access,  they still very badly want this game . If that doesn't tell you something positive... well, it should. It really should. They'll get mad at me for saying it, but the reality is that no-one would be so worked up about the game taking longer than planned to come out if it wasn't (a) very good and (b) hotly anticipated.  As it stands, you're looking at the game at a great time, because you don't have to go through any of that. Cheers.   So what are you getting for an early access purchase right now?  Story Mode is on the way in August, and a new update is coming toward the end of this month (May, 2017). You're getting a very fully-developed and immersive Sandbox mode with an order of magnitude more content than early adopters got to start with a few years ago. The objective of sandbox is blissfully, elegantly simple: Survive as long as possible. There's nothing supernatural about the game except for some extra-aggressive wildlife (for which there is a lore explanation). There are no zombies, no monsters, and no NPCs (for now) to attack you in the world. You're alone, with tons of ground to cover and scavenge, an array of tools to discover and craft, countless new types of clothes to layer onto your character thanks to the most recent major patch, and your only adversaries are your own vitals.  You can play the Sandbox on multiple difficulties, from the pacifistic, borderline-therapeutic Pilgrim, where you have to provoke hostile wildlife before it even notices you... to the utter brutality of Interloper, which is bar none one of the most if not the most challenging survival modes in contemporary gaming. The world will literally try to kill you, because as the difficulty setting's name attests, you are an interloper and you do not belong. And, of course, there are two difficulty levels in between those as well. So whether it's a brutal challenge you seek, or a beautiful world to explore, The Long Dark has both in spades, with considerable expansions to the game's features and entertainment value coming just over the horizon.  And that's to say nothing of the game's gorgeous, minimalist soundtrack, of which I will never be able to get enough.  I'd write more, but as I have said countless times, The Long Dark is at its best when you are brand new to the game world, completely unspoiled, and know nothing about where you are, where you need to go, or how to survive for more than a day. The first time your life drops to below 5% and you manage to stumble into shelter, patch your wounds, stuff your face, quench your thirst, and close your eyes in respite just before death takes you, then find yourself waking up to a recovering body the next morning... you will have discovered what makes The Long Dark such an incredible and visceral survival experience.  I'm obviously an ardent fan, so take away from the above whatever extra layers of positivity you feel you have to, but objectively speaking, this is a rare game crafted by rare people. It will make you feel cold, it will make your heart race, and it will draw you in. The likelihood that you will regret your purchase as a newcomer in May of 2017 or later is really quite low. This isn't hyperbole. I'm not that easily excited. I'm actually in my 30s. I had an NES controller in my hand when I was 5, and have been a gamer ever since. I have a multi-genre list, spanning decades, ranking my favorite games of all time. It's populated by Bioware RPGs, City Builders, Real time and Turn-based strategy titles, Chrono Trigger, and more.  This is not only one of the games on that list, but is easily one of the highest. And I'm just talking about the  Sandbox .  - бк -    TL;DR: The game is just plain, old-fashioned excellent, which is why so many people hate that it isn't finished yet. I highly recommend it, especially now. Among the best games I have played in 30+ years.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/unkn0wn_g/recommended/268050,1,   Bad image and horrible release, but great game!   My favorite survival horror game so far.  The graphics are nice, even tho the development of the game started in the era of the PS3. Many people told me that the controls are bad on PC with mouse/keyboard,  but I didn't encounter any problems, infact I enjoyed it more then with the PS4/Steam controller.  The game is a 3rd person shooter that tells you the Story of Detective Sebastian Castellanos, who's trying to solve the mystery of his missing wife and daughter. The story ist one of the best parts of the game, and is getting more interesting, the more you play.  The stealth elements on the other hand... Are a nightmare. The AI is dump  and the sneaking controls aren't flawless. But the worst part is the camera... I managed to beat the game by shooting my way throu, but the ammo is limited so you have to take adventag of traps and use your surroundings to save ammo.  The headshots feel extremly satisfying and the overall hit-registartion and feedback is great! You can upgade all your weapons and even yourself, HP / Stamina / CQC etc.  The sound is good and the soundtrack... OH MY GOD THE SOUNDTRACK! They did an amazing job and the outro song &quot;Long way down&quot; is now in my Spotify playlist.  On the release the game was full of bugs, had a 30 fps lock and big black bars, it all got fixed and the game is perfectly enjoyable.  Thing's, it's a horror game at the beginning. But once you saw all the different enemy-types and their weaknesses, upgreaded ur guns and feel more confident, it feels like and action game with jumpscares here and there.  I love the game anyway, and the 2 DLC's, &quot;Assignment&quot; and &quot;Consequens&quot; are waaaaay more scary. Seriously, way more scarier that the base-game.  I'd rate this game a solid 8/10.

Review  	   Celeste   really surprised me in so many ways. I knew from the onset that I was getting involved with a very difficult game, one that sits comfortably next to   Super Meat Boy   and   Cuphead   in terms of difficulty, and that the possibility was high for it to irritate me in equal measure and while there were many a moment I could feel my blood pressure reaching dangerous levels,   Celeste  бпs main protagonist, Madeline, had charmed her way so far into my heart that to abandon her and her journey would simply have broken my heart. For the 20 hours it took me to summit Mount   Celeste  , not only did I come away with enjoying some of the most fluid and responsive platform mechanics I have yet experienced in a game to date, what really surprised me was the depth the game went in order to tell its story.   Celeste  бпs story is hauntingly relatable as it tackles such deep and dark subjects as depression, anxiety, self-doubt and self-loathing all which symbolically begin to represent the very mountain Madeline is trying to summit. For Madeline her depression has taken root so strongly that as the tale unfolds we begin to acutely understand her desperation at overcoming the challenge she has set for herself and we genuinely fear what her other alternatives might me should she fail. Madelineбпs journey of self-discovery ends up being a beautiful one and one I really recommend each and everyone of you experience. For those that want to climb Mount   Celeste   but donбпt necessarily have the patience or the precision skills there is an assist mode if you feel the need to use it.   Celeste   often took me to the point of breaking, asking the impossible from me as each and every challenge got progressively more difficult, but there was always the sweet, sweet satisfaction that of lay at the end of completing a grueling level or area. The last chapter, just before summiting (checkpoint 13 and 2, I am looking at you) had some of the most hardcore challenges ever put to me by a single game, so much so that I ended up developing a blister on my right index finger from holding the right controller trigger down for so long,  but the thrill of reaching the top of the mountain was a feeling second to none as I furiously fist pumped the air in excitement and relief as I had helped Madeline overcome her difficulties so that she could hopefully begin to start living in a more gentler and lovelier light. Featuring a soundtrack that is so sublime it should be illegal,   Celeste   is not only one of my favorite games of the year, it has now become the gold standard by which I will judge this genre.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198021551803/recommended/427290,1,   	   Byte-sized review   	   I am here to suck the conversation out of you     	  Review  	 I decided to take a chance on   Vampyr   at full price, which is not something I would normally do, given that I am generally not really a fan of the developer, DontNod's, previous works. I found   Remember Me   to be a colossal bore that even with its incredibly short playtime was a chore to play through and I find their   Life is Strange   games a bit too mawkish and overly-sentimental for my tastes. So blow me over with a feather that   Vampyr   actually turns out to be surprisingly good, well at least good enough for me to reconsider their games in the future when they aren't mining adolescence for the nausea-inducing feels.   Vampyr   had me gripped from the get go, especially given that I was drawn to the bitter irony of the tale that centers around a turn of the century blood transfusion doctor being bitten by a vampire and being turned into one himself and then having to deal with a viral epidemic that threatens to wipe out London, that may or may not be linked to his creator.   Vampyr   isn't perfect however as it suffers from what   Life is Strange   suffered from which is some god awful prose. The game is littered with some clangers that nearly caused my ears to bleed (&quot;What is glass but tortured sand&quot;; &quot;What is darkness but setting sun&quot;) but thankfully it's a lot better this time around. Learning to dial it back a bit is still a lesson the writers at DontNod haven't quite yet mastered. The combat is also not as refined as it could be (I would describe it as scrappy and rough around the edges), there are sections of the game that feel a bit graphically underwhelming considering that early 20th century London can look striking when you are out and about questing. There also seems to be an odd problem with engine lighting because each character looks like they are being lit up by an inner lantern dialed all the way up to 10, with light piercing through the crevices of where they have been stitched together giving each character an odd Frankenstein look. Where   Vampyr   does excel is that it offers one of largest and most memorable cast of characters I have yet encountered in a game. Each character (and there are many) are fleshed out and feel distinctly real, not cardboard-caricatures of the era when they aren't sprouting purple prose. It is also an incredibly focused and tight affair (something I am all the more grateful for). There is no busy work/fat built in here (unless you plan on healing every citizen in every district). You have main quests and side quests (all which enhance the main story) and none of the hundred million other doodahs that seems to populate open world RPG's these days that simply serve as distractions.   Vampyr   is also an incredibly well optimized game and I was able to run it without any slow down at 4K/60FPS. Word of warning:-   Vampyr   is heavy on exposition and you will often be locked into lengthy pieces of dialog with various characters so if that is not your thing you might want to reconsider. Thankfully all of it is gripping and enjoyable to listen too with enough twists and turns along the way to ensure that, narratively , you are kept on your toes. As it stands,   Vampyr   gets a recommend from me.   	  One word to sum up the experience  	 Gripping   	  Performance/Bug related incidents  	 No game breaking bugs were encountered outide of the odd engine lighting issue highlighted in the review. Game is incredibly well optimized and should scale admirably on various hardware.

Billed as an action murder mystery,   Omensight   takes elements from the movie Groundhog Day and infuses them with a Murder She Wrote style plot where you assume the role of the Harbinger, a warrior summoned to the world during times of strife and crises and tasked with solving the murder of a priestess which has sparked off an impending apocalypse. It is your duty to relive the worlds final day as you hunt for clues, fight enemies and uncover the culprit before all is lost. It's a Greek tragedy told beautifully with high contrast cell shading that gives the game a unique look. The games combat, whilst not overly complicated, is just the right side of enjoyable as it slowly introduces new powers and abilities to you the further you progress and offers just the right amount of challenge. Famed game designer and RPG scribe extraordinaire, Chris Avellone (Planescape: Torment, Pillars of Eternity, Fallout New Vegas), adds heft to the writing duo of Nadim Boukhira (Stories) and Genese Davis who tell a story worthy of your time investigating and who flesh out each of the four suspects so that they end up being fully-fledged three dimensional characters and not cardboard caricatures. I enjoyed   Omensight   immensely, especially getting to know the surprisingly complex characters that inhabit this mystery. Recommended.   	  One word to sum up the experience  	 Intriguing   	  Performance/Bug related incidents  	 None. Game also ran flawlessly at 1080p and 2160.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198021551803/recommended/838310,1,   	   Byte-sized review   	   Pixel perfect 8-bit demonic slaying bundle of joy     	  Review in under a minute  	   Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon   is an 8-bit homage to the famed   Castlevania   franchise from the legendary   Castlevania   creator himself - Koji Igarashi- and forms part of a stretch goal for the upcoming kickstarted   Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night  .   Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon   finds Igarashi firing on all retro cylinders that one can only say the anticipation for   Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night   is now officially through the roof.   Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon   puts you into the shoes of demon slayer Zangetsu who must travel through a perilous land to defeat an ancient and powerful demon lurking in a dark castle. Along the way Zangetsu will be joined by three other playable characters, each with their own special and unique abilities that helps unlock new paths for Zangetsu as he progresses through each level.   Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon   captures the essence of an 8-bit   Castlevania   game so perfectly that for its duration (5-10 hours depending on how you play) I felt like I had been transported in a time capsule to my eight year old self again as I battled my way through Dracula's demonic castle in the original   Castlevania  .   Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon   is one of the highlights of the year for me and I would have given it an &quot;Essential&quot; rating if it were not for a serious bug I encountered about half-way through my playthrough where my XBox One controller stopped being recognized. I tried everything suggested on the forums and internet to no avail which resulted in forcing me to move to the keyboard and mouse (two peripherals I absolutely hate for gaming outside of playing a strategy game) in order to complete. Considering the forums are littered with people experiencing the same issue and still not a patch in sight a month down the line just be aware that you could run into a similar issue. I wouldn't say this should stop you from buying the game if you are a   Castlevania   fan and while I found it a major irritation there was so much to love in   Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon   that I was able to eventually see past it.   	  One word to sum up the experience  	 Nostalgic   	  Performance/Bug related incidents  	 Bug where the game stopped recognizing the XBox One controller. No amounts of reinstall's (of the game itself and controller drivers) seemed to resolve the issue.

There is no reason for it to exist. Everything   Bless Online   does is implemented so ham-fistedly that you have to wonder if this isn't an experiment where a bunch of chimpanzees were tasked to put an MMO together. In fact I have a sneaky feeling the chimpanzees would probably do a better job than what is being done here. I have given this game 15 hours (14 too many) and 2 months to improve but in those two months not once has the game client updated at all. This whole game is a farce. A complete fiasco. They don't plan on ever trying to fix the myriad of problems that currently exist with it. But they are quick to sell you in-game cosmetic doodahs! Priorities here people. Fix your ????ing game first. It looks terrible with the games performance being totally abysmal. I am running it on a 1080ti and even this card is struggling to keep this game from dropping to shockingly low frame rates which indicates these performance problems are so severe that they more than likely would require an entire gutting of the engine to get right, something we know is never going to happen despite this being released as an early access title. Considering this release in the West is the third time Neocore is trying to launch this failed MMO (no doubt to recoup costs since it failed in the East and in Russia) should serve as a dire warning. It is nothing more than a scam and you are well advised to stay as far away as possible. The story, if you can call it that, is barely even there and is simply generic fantasy pap that the pot plant on my desk could put together in an hour. Don't even get me started on the combat. The developers call it rhythmic combat. I call it?????? You control your character using the normal WSAD keys with your combat actions activated from your action bar (standard MMO stuff) but these combat actions need to be strengthend by action combos in order for them to have any desirable effect on the enemies in the world which are activated using either the R, T or Y key. Who in their ????ing right minds though this control set up was a good idea? Unless you are 2018's &quot;Typist of the Year&quot; award winner, or you have managed to grow a third hand, you are going to struggle trying to strafe around enemy attacks using your A and D key, controlling the camera with your other hand via the mouse all the while trying to strengthen combat attacks with combos by pressing R, T or Y. It simply doesn't work and it makes the game harder than it actually needs to be. I know MMO junkies are hard up for the next big thing, but I am sorry this just ain't it. Avoid this game like the plague. You have been warned.   	  One word to sum up the experience  	 Abysmal   	  Performance/Bug related incidents  	 This game has so many issues from texture pop in, textures not loading, terrible performance, quests not activating that it really is not worth your time or investment.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027390777/recommended/428690,1, A very addicting game. It shows a lot of potential to become really great.  The game has a lot of well fleshed out gamemacanics and feels really unique, but still has a lot of bugs has to fix. The beginning of the game is now the most fun part and definatly the most well developed. Later in the game, money is a bit flying your way, which reduces the challange at that point. Also in the last levels, bottle necks accure when you want to make multiple video's at the same time on a console (which is everything that is not played on a pc), because only one of these video's can be recorded at the time.

The devs probably should be harser on these people (like ip ban, otherwise they keep comming back), otherwise the future of this game does not look good.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198021551803/recommended/822130,-1,   	   Byte-sized review   	   A platform adventure best left marooned on a deep sea ocean island     	  Review  	 I adore 2D/3D colourful platformers (next to RPG's it's my second favorite genre). In fact some of my favorite gaming memories consist of myself huddling around the NES, SEGA Mega Drive, Playstation 1 and 2 playing through each systems latest colourful platformer, often staying up into the wee hours of the morning getting lost in each ones world. While the genre has fallen out of favor somewhat unfortunately with the big publishers thankfully we have indie game studios trying to rekindle the flame and through that we have seen a popular resurgence with 2D 8/16 bit adventures such as   Shovel Knight   and   The Messenger   and in the 3D realm with the brilliant   A Hat in Time   to the mediocre and somewhat disappointing   Yooka-Laylee   (disappointing considering the talent behind this one) to even Crash Bandicoot making an appearance on modern systems with the well received   Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy  . The moment I saw   Flynn and Freckles   pop up on the Steam store I knew I immediately had to give it a try. Sadly, and really it pains me to do this because I can see the developers clearly have the same love for the genre as I do even citing Spyro, Guybrush and Crash in the credits as inspiration for the game, I just can't recommend this game. While the PS2 aesthetics didn't bother me in the slightest (I found the graphics quite charming in a simple way) what is unfortunate is how bland and unremarkable the adventure is. Had this released in the early noughties it would probably have gone completely unnoticed as well and while it tries to pay homage to the era it does nothing to make it stand out. Coupled with terrible animations (Flynn walks like he has a carrot stuck up his backside) and a dull-as-dishwater plot (young pirate searches for the treasure of one fabled pirate), I could have probably gotten over those issues and simply given the game a &quot;meh&quot; rating if it were not for the one mechanic that simply ruins it all, a mechanic you need to absolutely nail in a platform adventure, you know - the jumping bits. Jumping bits that require precision but that are totally broken. I spend more time dying and getting frustrated with the jumping, especially since the game is quite puzzle heavy (nothing taxing), but often requires that the jumping mechanic actually works, which it doesn't. Lots of trial and error ensured much to my chagrin. The second major issue I have with this game is that it only saves periodically but not enough (mostly only when you enter a new area) and should you die (and you will thanks to the broken jumping mechanic) you are often forced to replay through large sections, having to resolve puzzles you just solved (and often struggled to solve because of the jumping mechanic working against you). This ultimately ends up sinking this adventure.   	  One word to sum up the experience  	 Broken   	  Performance/Bug related incidents  	 I did come across a few bugs, especially where Flynn has to pick up pots to depress certain switches where I could not pick up the pot at all or I would put the pot on the switch and it would end up getting stuck in the geometry resulting in me not being able to use the switch or pick up the pot.

Things improved drastically, thankfully, from the third episode onward as the story veered into difficult and dark territory.   Life is Strange: Beyond the Storm   unnecessarily fills in the gap before the original   Life is Strange   but honestly it shouldn't have bothered. While Chloe was as stubborn as a mule and as head-strong as an ox in the original she was no where near as ingrating and irritating as she is here. I also didn't buy the friendship/romance that develops between the two main characters, who are polar opposites in the high school hierarchy and personality spectrum. By the time   Life is Strange: Before the Storm   credits rolled I was really regretting my past decision from the original of   saving Chloe and not the townsfolk. I should have just let the annoying cow die and I could have romanced the townsfolk instead  . Without the supernatural or sci-fi undertones all you are left with here is a rather weak and tepid attempt at teenage drama and angst. Clearly there is an audience for this and and I am not that target audience. This is hard pass from me.

My only wish is that they would hire better writers because the writing veers from cliched to overly-sentimental to trite all in one dialog exchange that while listening my eyeballs were more often than not visiting the back of my head rather than viewing what was on screen if front of them (something the original   Life is Strange  , and I hear   Vampyr  , suffer from as well).  All in all, it's short, sweet and cliche-be-damed rather affecting. Game also has a surprising amount of foul language considering it's a game featuring a 10 year old boy.

It's problematic to play it without a controller but not impossible. There is a random level generator and tons of weapons &amp; equipment.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198021551803/recommended/49540,-1,   	   Byte-sized review   	   Colonial Turd     	  Review  	 How do you top James Cameron's   Aliens  ? Simple, you call in SEGA and GEARBOX and ask them to make a video game sequel to what is arguably one of the best action movies ever made if pre-release footage of the game in motion was to be believed. After having seen the footage, the internet was practically chomping at the bit to get its hands on a copy as hyperbole was flying thick and fast and the fans were lapping it up. Was this going to be the   Alien   game to end all   Alien   games? With GEARBOX coming off the double success of   Borderlands   and its sequel   Borderlands 2   it seemed that nothing could possibly go wrong. It was only inevitable then that if this hype train were to derail, it would derail spectacularly and that is exactly what happend when the game was released to paying audiences in 2013.   Aliens: Colonial Marines   release was a complete mess. It was broken, the alien AI was atrocious but most importantly it was ugly, looking nothing like what had been shown at E3 the previous year before. Understandably there was outrage directed at both SEGA and GEARBOX (it was later revealed GEARBOX had farmed development out to another studio). Having now finally played it that anger is totally justified. It plays fast and loose with alien lore (exploding xenomorphs? Really now), alien design (since when did queen xenomorphs resemble alien versions of the rhinoceros? Poor Giger must be rolling in his grave), the story is utter tripe matched with some of the ugliest cut-scenes I have yet experienced in a game as recent as this one (I have seen better in games that came out 10 years prior), the A.I. - even with the fix - is still pathetic and you can see its troubled development history as the game doesn't quite know whether it wants to be an   Alien   game or a cheap and dirty   Call of Duty   knockoff that just happens to feature some aliens. Thankfully I played this in co-op and in doing so the game becomes a tragicomedy. Had I gone solo I would most likely have quite out after the first hour or two to never return again.   Aliens: Colonial Marines   is terrible on every conceivable level. Thankfully SEGA was able to redeem themselves with the brilliant   Alien: Isolation  , a game that captures the spirit and essence of the franchise perfectly even if it was a little too drawn out. You are better hanging out with that one and forgetting this travesty ever existed.   	  One word to sum up the experience  	 Rubbish   	  Performance/Bug related incidents  	 I didn't experience any issues outside of the apparent typo (that still to this day has not been fixed by GEARBOX) regarding the .ini misspelling which causes the aliens A.I to hardly ever attack the player.   	  Similar to games  	   Alien vs. Predator  ;   Alien: Isolation  ;   Call of Duty franchise  ;   FEAR     	  Suitable for  	 People who enjoy first person shooters. The game will probably be more accepted by those not so close to the franchise lore to see the liberties it takes.   	  Current position in my games of 2018 cleared list  	 37th position.

Not only does it successfully mimic what made countless NES era games such as   Ninja Gaiden   and   Castlevania   so wildly successful back in the day, it actually succeeds in passing majority of the games it pays homage too. The metroidvania / 8 &amp; 16 Bit revival has produced a glut of modern retakes on these old, familiar tropes but none of them have successfully achieved what   The Messenger   achieves, which is a perfect symbiosis of old and new. The closest modern retake I can think that matches   The Messenger   beat for beat is Yacht Clubs magnificent   Shovel Knight   so just know that you are incredible company here.   The Messenger   is an incredibly well designed game from its cast of colourful, well written, characters that help flesh out its gorgeously and cleverly designed world. Each area is painstakingly recreated in both 8 and 16 bit which houses many secrets as the player learns to shift between the two asethics. I must also give the game credit for its writing and story. I don't normally go into metroidvania's or platformers thinking I am going to get an enjoyable tale, merely just a serviceable one as narrative is usually nothing more than a means to and end in these kinds of games, but   The Messenger   raises that bar in such a way that I often had to check myself that I wasn't playing a big sprawling narrative heavy RPG / action adventure game. While the game has many dramatic arcs thankfully it never takes itself too seriously and I often found myself chuckling along at it as its crazy, and fantastic, story unfolded. Where   The Messenger   succeeds the most, and the one area that could have easily sunk it, is with the gameplay which plays out like blazingly fast ballet of swords, shuriken and leaps that when choreographed in perfect harmony almost reaches a nirvana-like state of euphoria in the player. Please don't look at the   The Messenger   and pass it off as just &quot;another retro-indie&quot; because you will be doing yourself a great disservice and missing out on one of the best gaming experiences of the year, or any year for that fact.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027390777/recommended/289070,1, I am really in a love/hate relationship with this game and I finally know why. This is a core game atm with a lot of potential to build upon. The game is hard to master, because you feel in the beginning that you are drowning in the stuff you want to do, while realising you will never be able to do everything. And all the time I have the feeling I am falling behind in my victory progress and all of the sudden I am the leader by far at the mid-late game (at King difficulty). However I have great trouble getting a good game start on Emperor difficulty, while the end game still feels to easy. The victory routes feel kind of grindy, which make the endgame quite dull.  But, if the developers will add more stuff to do, this will be the best Civ game ever! The core machanics are fun and work good. But it is still a good idea to play the game now, so you get a good feeling of the core game. Time will tell if it was it all worth it. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/unkn0wn_g/recommended/359930,-1, This is just aweful.  Clunky controlls (controller &amp; keyboard) , bad graphics, boring arena fights and very little story.  I actually was hyped to play this after the first 2 DLCs, but was terribly disapointed.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/unkn0wn_g/recommended/345980,1, This DLC was actually waaaaaaaay more scarier than the game itself. The only downside for me was, that you don't have any weapons. It's rather a stealth game than a 3rd person shooter, however, I enjoyed my time with it.  A solid DLC with good content and more story.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/unkn0wn_g/recommended/33230,1,  One of the best Assasins Creed games (my favorite one)!    Ignore my playtime in Steam, I have like 50h in this game (PS3 and Uplay edition)  The graphics aged well, even tho the soundtrack is generic and nothing special.  The controls are smooth with a controller but is not optimized for keyboard n' mouse. My biggest problem in this game where the collectables.  They dont give this feeling of statisfaction wich gives me A Hat in Time f.e.  It's just boring running from point A to point B,  but this game isn't 'bout collecting stuff anyway.  Story: 7/10 Gameplay: 8/10 Graphics: 6/10 Soundtrack: 3/10 Sound: 4/10 Controlls: 6/10  Story:  You play Ezio Auditore in the 15th century in florencia.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/unkn0wn_g/recommended/289070,-1, So yeah, I really didn't knew if I should write a positive or negative review, I decided to not recommend the game, and that's why:  It's overpraised af. The game itself maybe doesn't seem so, but 30ву for a DLC that adds so little to the game. Or the new expansion pack coming out soon, 40ву! Wtf?! 40ву for an expansion pack! Who tf is responsible for the marketing?! 5ву for a new Civ and a scenario??  Also I don't like the cartoony style, I liked the one from Civ V much better. I see what they tried to do with that whole district thing, make the cities bigger and make it feel more lived-in, but it doesn't really work and is rather annoying imo. Also, the unexplored area is kinda beige-colored, while the area that is explored, but not in the range of vision is a brighter beige with a little transparency, and the overall game looks yellow-orangy. I don't know how many times I was sending my scouts to an already explored area cuz of that, I had to download the Civ V Clouds mod to fix that.  That being said, the mods feel much more stable then on Civ V, I had like 3-4 crashes on my 60h, and that's not too bad I guess.  The rest of the game really just feels like Civ V with &quot;brave new world&quot; and &quot;gods and kings&quot; already build in. Witch is not really a bad thing, and after you get used to the district system, it's actually quite fun. The first 20h I was hating the game really much, but now it feels enjoyable.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/unkn0wn_g/recommended/396650,1,   The most underrated VN I've ever played  The Artstyle is pretty clean, and the soundtrack was &quot;ok&quot; in the best case. Nothing special tho, the thing that made the game so good to me was the character development. Awesome dialogues, actually well written script with funny (and non-cringe) jokes and situations. There are many references to other games, anime and manga. Hell, they even copied a hole character from Persona 4 into this game, changed his name and changed the looks :'D  It's definetly one of my favorite VNs, but nothing is perfect.  There are many clichижs, f.e.: You have the typicall exchange student setting, you find a couple friends and now take a look what we have: The dude who is hyped every second he lives and has to much energy, the shy intelligent girl, the typicall tsundere, the kind but naive girl and a over-sexualized mechanic (sadly she's not a fox. RIP Noble Senpai). Oh, and don't forget the underaged younger sister. And you have the clichиж beach and onsen scenes.  Overall, the game is worth every cent. Just don't expect it to be Monster/Monogatari. The plot is great, but not really deep. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/snips_/recommended/289070,1, Sure, there are still plenty of negative reviews for this and they can have that opinion. And I'll admit that I agree with some of those points that they bring up. However, for an overall opinion mine is positive. Sure, the AI still are a bit problematic, but that is due to change when Gathering Storm goes live. The way I see it now, buying this game is an investment for those on the fence.  One problem that I do have with those that directly compare VI to V is that this game is still being updated and has its second DLC coming up (Gathering Storm) and V is completed with its two (Gods &amp; Kings and Brave New World). When V first went live, I felt that IV was better. People forget that V started with combat units having a 10 hp pool and G&amp;K brought that up to 100.  What I'm saying is that while the current game (at that time that I'm writing this) is not perfect but Rising Storm has the potential to improve it significantly.  tl:dr- Buy as investment for future DLCs and stop comparing a game with known future updates to a game that is finished.

There was a bug where I couldn't change the resulation until I reinstalled it. And I don't have ingame-sounds when I connect my Laptop to the TV.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008795719/recommended/289070,1, Though the game was definitely bare in its initial release, the Rise and Fall expansion makes Civilization VI one of the greatest in the series. As a longtime Civilization player (roughly 11 years now) I judge these games pretty harshly. I was releuctant at first to accept the new city-building feature of the game, but as my 225+ hours of gameplay will tell you, I quickly fell in love. As perhaps the biggest change to the game, it has added a new dimension to Civilization, changing it just enough to keep it interesting but not so much that the game is unrecognizable *glares accusingly at Civilization Beyond Earth*. The game has been great for a Civilization veteran like me as well as my rookie friends. I anxiously await the next expansion.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/snips_/recommended/235580,1, This DLC made Civ V into the great game that it is currently. The tourism mechanic is another way to achieve that sneaky victory over your opponents. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/snips_/recommended/8930,1, The only problem that I had with this game was that I played it too much. It's the standard with the Civilizaton series and after way too much time spent playing, I still found myself logging a few more hours daily. Currently it has fallen to the wayside because of Civ VI, but if I had leftover room in my memory, I'd reinstall this without a second thought.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/465650,1, OOTP18 is the latest version of a great baseball simulator.  I noticed two significant changes from OOTP16 (last version that I owned).  First, the 3D view of the game.  Pervious versions that I played was basically text-only with minimal graphical reflections of the action.  This addition is a very nice touch and aligns with the play-by-play text that is presented.  Since I tend to play all the games (not sim), I have enjoyed this feature much  more than I would have thought.  Another little nuance that I thought was great is after a completed game, there is a nice recap of the game along with player &quot;quotes&quot; and a probability of winning line as the game progressed.  The other significant change that I found is the new &quot;challenge mode.&quot;  Although this does not fundamentally change the game, you can now compare your results to the other OOTP18 players out there.  Challenge mode restricts a couple things in the game (e.g. player editor, long-term simulation), but does enable your score to be recorded against other players.  These two changes were worth getting OOTP18.    For those that are unfamiliar with the series, OOTP18 is a baseball game for all of the armchair GMs and Managers that are out there.  This is the third iteration that I have played (OOTP16 and OOTP10) and the game continues to evolve very well.  As with the pervious couple of versions, OOTP has the MLB and Player's Association license.  As a sports fan, you always wonder about how you would remake your favorite team into a dynasty and now is your chance.  You start with the ability to manage a MLB team today or any year from 1871.  You may also choose one of several International Leagues that are available.  From day one, you can delegate authority to the AI or control everything.  From the GM perspective, this includes player and staff contracts, free agent signings, major/minor league roster moves, drafts, trades, and organizational budget allocations.  From the manager perspective, you set your pitching rotations and lineups.  At that point, you can dive into playing each baseball game or sim through the days.  All the statistics from MLB history is available and its fun starting from scratch in 1871 to learn about the early pioneers in baseball.  The other great thing about the OOTP series is the ability to create your own fictional leagues, uniforms, and designs with the large user-mod community.  The bottom line is that this game is a must have for people who love baseball.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/208400,1, This is a game for those who want to experience the nostalgic turn-base RPG.  For those familiar with Ultima IV (1985 release), Avernum will bring back those fond memories.  In Escape from the Pit, you control up to four party members who have been banished from the Empire.  From that seed, the storyline will grow.  Since this is a relaunch of the Avernum series, the graphics are kept simple, but effective and plays efficiently on much older systems.  Combat is turn-base with turns accomplished sequentially by intitiative and party order.  The story is interesting with plenty of side quests and dungeons/caves to crawl around and explore.  There is plenty of content since as of this review, I'm over 12 hours in and have covered around 1/3 of the map.  Bottom line is that this is a fun turn-base RPG.  It's a must for the fans of Ultima IV.
