https://steamcommunity.com/id/synthzsteam/recommended/583950,-1, Enter the Pay2Pay era!  Awesome production value, great mechanics, beautiful lore, but the game is built around a single purpose, to dump money into it. Everything requires payment, including the competitive mode, and as of now, there's no ladders, rankings or a progression system, not even achievements, imagine that. If you're not planning to dump hundreds of euros on a digital card game, steer away from it.  Valve is a real dissapointment these days, they've lost touch with their crowd, no longer a fan.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/synthzsteam/recommended/304390,-1, Boring gameplay. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/12315122762341/recommended/570,1, First off, I don't play League of Legends or any other DoTa style games and I first saw Dota when I downloaded Dota 2 from Steam a few days ago. I must say, this game is pretty bad. I only tried the tutorial levels and that was enough for me. It's a super dumbed-down, uber-simplified and a completely chaotic resemblance of an RTS game. First, you can only control 1 character which has only 2 active abilities (and 2 passive ones). Everything else in the game happens pretty much by itself: creeps keep running along the lanes, towers shoot. After your creeps or the enemy creeps are dead, you advance a bit forward (or fall back), damage the enemy tower a bit (or yours is damaged), wait for the next wave, and it repeats and repeats for a very long time until all the defensive structures of one of the sides are destroyed. You don't know what abilities the enemy player has because there are just so many different hero types there and you can't know them all, at least at start.  The worst thing about this game (and that's why I won't play it no matter what) is it's obvious focus on items and shopping. They force you to equip items, and i don't need to play this game for long to know that in the end, if you want to play this game seriously, you WILL have to buy those crap items for real money. This game is an RTS from the outside, but in its core it's a shop. A shop where lazy and unintelligent kids will spend their parents' money to buy &quot;cool stuff&quot; and win against others just like them. It's a game for the generation of consumers and shoppers. Thanks a lot, but I don't need this. If you like shopping, go forward, make the devs rich and feel yourself powerful in those virtual armors and rings.  As a fan of Dune 2, C&amp;C (the first one) and Age of Empires, I am just sorry to see where the genre has developed

Handful of buildings, but it boils down to 4-  1. Houses- you build constantly 2. Resources- wood/quarry/food, built on nodes. Two electricity buildings when needed.  3. Upgrades- three tiers, very linear 4. Defense- two for unit production, two usable towers, and walls/gates.  Theres not really choices to be made, every game you approach with the same strategy. Theres no factions, and mayors are almost pointless.   Its not ready. Game is essentially starcraft, you play as terran vs zerg. zerg has no base, your buildings spawn zerg on destruction. Remember those Wings of Liberty levels vs the undead terran? Basically that. I'm 90% sure i've played a starcraft mod exactly like this, but more depth.

Upon attempting to get a refund, it was denied because I already opened the cards that came with the game (with no warning attached). GG Valve. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/alixey/recommended/583950,-1, An excellent card game, flawed by a terrible monetization scheme. The gameplay and the mechanics are really good, which adds a breathe of fresh air to the genre, and the overall experience of the game itself. But the shady microtransaction practices prevent me to recommend it. The price of the purchase is not enough to fully enjoy it. You will need to spend more money to stay competitive, otherwise you'll be bound to the Draft Mode which at the moment doesn't have any progression system whatsoever, and doesn't allow to earn free cards. In fact, you can't earn free cards at all. Other similar games have login bonuses, dailies, weeklys, and many more mechanics to stay somewhat competitive even without paying anything more. With your purchase, only half of the game is available to you without paying more money. And this for me, is unacceptable. Unless something changes, at the moment, I don't recommend playing this game at all. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/12315122762341/recommended/250900,1, Blinding of Isac is side scrolling grind fest with not much going for it.

If you like getting cheapshotted by traps And the endless amounts of Flying enemies, then this game is perfect for you. The difficulty is punishing With absolutely no rewards for the player. Also, the price of this game is ridiculous.  so you're not really getting value for money. You probably won't Want to play this game for hours on end, it's Really only playable in Ten to twenty minutes bursts, which makes it a Crappy non-portable game. I am Seriously getting tired of developers Choosing to make games punishingly difficult with No reward in it for the player and/or not adding more difficulty Levels. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/alixey/recommended/382900,1, Sono un fan sfegatato della serie di Final Fantasy, e reputo il VI il migliore tra tutti. Anche se il porting di questa versione di Final Fantasy VI, uscito originariamente su smartphone, non rende giustizia alla versione originale che all'epoca era un tripudio di grafica a 32 bit all'avanguardia per i suoi tempi, rimane comunque una edizione estremamente fedele all'originale, con qualche piccola modifica per rendere il gioco sicuramente pi¨´ appetibile ad un pubblico moderno. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/alixey/recommended/613830,1, I'm a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series, and I absolutely needed to play this since I never got the chance to do it when it released originally. Although this port of Chrono Trigger had some technical and graphical issues when it released, it didn't do justice to the original game that was a blaze of 32-bit graphics, state-of-the-art for its time. Yet, still remains an extremely faithful edition to the original game, with some minor changes to make the game definitely more appealing to a modern audience. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/MattBSG/recommended/440,1, This is just the best multiplayer game I have EVER PLAYED. Highly recommend for the low price of: FREE!!! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/alixey/recommended/681660,-1, The game itself it's nice, for the little gameplay I experienced. Avoid this game until they solve their massive issues with their servers. Crashes, queues and lags for a terrible 2-day headstart experience.  UPDATE: Server issues should be now solved, only because the population has drastically decreased. This has been caused by poor management of the community team, with many miscomunications, lack of content and updates, and an overall mediocre gameplay execution.  Play something else. Avoid this game.  UPDATE 2: The population has decreased even further once more. They dropped the price of the game in hope to attract more players but that didn't work out. They keep releasing &quot;community updates&quot; videos on their YouTube channel when they're struggling to have one. Did I mention that this game has a rampant cheating problem, and that cheats can be enabled by simply modifying an .ini file in the game's folder? And that PvP is enabled only in very specific time-frames of the day and most of the time people can't find any matches due to low population?  If &quot;disaster&quot; could have a name, it would be Bless Online.  UPDATE 3: The devs announced an enhanced port of the game, due to be released as a free to play title for the Xbox One in 2019. The development team has been shrunk to just 5 (!) people as a consequence. It is still unclear if Bless Online will eventually shut down for good now. This game is slowly becoming a scam.  UPDATE 4: The devs announced that the Early Access period will end on October 23rd, which will make the game fully free to play, despite saying that the game would have been forever buy to play in the first place, and quoting that they &quot;Can't wait to show improvements and content they have been working on for the launch.&quot; (Still two missing classes from the Korean version, which in the meantime has been shut down).  The current pupulation has declined to just 500 people in the peak hours, which currently represents the true state of the game. Do yourself a favor and don't play this when it goes free to play. IT IS NOT WORTH IT. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/MattBSG/recommended/583950,-1, Artifact: A great card game, and VALVe's newest child. It flips current online card games on their heads with entirely new ways to go about things. It is not without it's gripes however - I believe the game is amazing in it's state, but being unable to get cards unless you buy packs (literally the *only* way) is a huge turn off, including missing player -&gt; player trading. Market integration is interesting where you can buy any card but they don't control inflation, Axe (a hero) for example is currently ~$20. You can open packs and get heros *that come with the game*.  A lot of these small things ruin constructed, as it's impossible to properly make a deck without buying from the market unless you are absurdly lucky with packs. Some of the things I listed need to change before I can recommend the game, but that is not to say that the game is bad, as it is QUITE the opposite; Artifact is an amazing game in its mechanics, damaged by many small problems.

Not only did they give beta players the game for free they also allowed them to unload all their rare cards before the market was available to everyone. They got ot sell their cards for $50 while we can at most get $15 out of the same card now.   Valve scammed every single person who preordered with this.  Hopefully this game dies within a year so they can start to work on HL3.   This is pay to win and pay to play scam.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/BinaryChaos/recommended/583950,-1, TL;DR - I'm not particularly impressed about the game. I don't think I will buy / play it, even if it were free to play. I also think that if this game came from any other developer, it would never get off the ground...But that's my opinion.  What follows is my own opinion. I cannot speak for everyone, and believe everyone is entitled to their own opinion. If you have the spare cash and curious about the game, go ahead and buy it and make your own judgements.  I've dabbled in a few card games in the past few years (now that they're popular), and by no means an expert. I've played MTG, Hearthstone, Elder Scrolls: Legends and a few others here and there, including some table tops with some personal friends. I will try not to compare Artifact too much to other games, but they also tend to be the baseline for comparison.  Without further ado...  Artifact brings its own spin on the electronic card game genre. It pulls from other card games like the colours + varying playstyles from MTG and the lanes function from Elder Scrolls: Legends, all the while implementing core concepts from Dota like lanes, item purchasing, heroes and creeps and abilities.  Pros: + Visuals are really nice. If you like the visual style from Dota, you'll feel right at home. + Unique card mechanics you don't see in other card games (like Cleave), while implementing traditional mechanics like deathtouch (insta-kill) and trample (additional damage to lifepoints). + Win condition in the game is pretty cool. Destroy two of three towers in different lanes or Destroy the tower + Core in one lane. + Deckbuilding is nice. Minimum of 40 cards (no limit) and 9 items. The two are distinct from one another and don't contribute towards the same card total. I anticipate the game will bring in a lot of different deck permutations to keep the meta fresh. You have plenty of creeps, spells and Improvements (a type of passive ability you can add to a lane) + Cards and heroes bring unique abilities to the table  All and all, Artifact is a nice card game which although doesn't bring anything super revolutionary is still unique to keep things fresh. I don't anticipate the game to become stale because everyone can pick different colour combinations, each with different playstyles AND different heroes to choose from, each with varying abilities.  I should note while deckbuilding that each hero comes with three ability cards which contribute towards the card total for a deck. I am also fairly certain you are obligated to pick 5 heroes per deck, which takes 15 card slots from a minimum of 40. Make of it what you want. I personally think it's good for newer players, but also think it was a little restrictive if you want a low card count while also throwing in a lot of spells and Improvements.  Cons: - LOOOONG games. This is partly due to the fighting in the three lanes. Each player gets 30-45 seconds to play a card, followed by another 30-45 second rebuttle until each player passes, then there's a face off. You can easily spend 5 minutes in a single lane, and deal next to no damage to the enemy tower. Games can easily last 20 minutes to an hour. - Difficult to understand mechanics (at first). There is a tutorial, but this is no Hearthstone. The only way to learn the mechanics in and out is to test them out. It can be difficult to understand which spells affects which target and who can target who. Don't get me wrong, complexity is awesome! But at the same time I think there might be a better way to describe an abiliy. - The best card in this game is your credit card. The only way to purchase cards, packs and event tickets is through real money transactions, which makes me a little worried about the long term viability for the game. I mean sure, you will be able to trade cards and by them off the marketplace. However, this locks out a considerable player base who may not have the means to play your game or dish out a large amount of money to obtain cards. Which brings me to my next point. - This game expects you to dish out large amounts of money. You pay $22USD for the base game (2 decks, 10 card packs &amp; 5 event tickets) and there is no in-game currency in order to obtain cards and/or packs. Get your wallets ready. Lord Gaben will roll around in the cash cow that is the card game genre in 2018.  If you've made it this far, I hope this review was helpful to make the decision on whether or not to buy the game. For me, it comes down to finances and the length of the games. I don't see myself capping out my credit card on virtual cards nor spending an hour to play a single game with no reward at the end of it all, especially when its competitors provide incentives to keep playing (in the form of card packs or in-game currency). If Valve comes up with a way to reward players for time spent playing, I might reconsider. As it stands currently, I can't recommend the game.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/BinaryChaos/recommended/323580,1, Jotun is a beautiful game artistically. The music, the lore, and the environments are beautiful. If you enjoy Norse mythology, then I suggest you give this game a shot.  Unfortuantely, the game is very short. I beat it in 5 hours, although it could have been done much faster had I not wanted to collect all the power-ups, and had I been able to kill the bosses much faster. That said, the final boss took me a solid hour to defeat, and that's with all the power-ups! The game is quite easy to pick up. The controls are simple, but the bosses are challenging and take one or two deaths to understand all their mechanics, as they often have two or three phases associated to them.  That said, I don't know if I would pay 17$CAD for this game. I got it while it was free, and decided to play it because I have time to kill. It is fun, but has little replayability value in my books, and only worth it when it's free (mostly due to the length of the story).

https://steamcommunity.com/id/BinaryChaos/recommended/42910,-1, I would first like to begin that there are multiple positive aspects to this game, and that I think I would have enjoyed it far more if I played it with friends. I am writing this review from a solo player point of view.  The game has plenty of pop culture references, and the dialogue / story can be quite funny at times. The &quot;Sims&quot;-like  approach to the in-game dialogue makes it pretty entertaining as you try to decipher as many languages as possible in order to make out what they actually say.  However, I just can't seem to get into the gameplay. You have a multitude of items to choose from (all with different spells and effects), and you find new spells in every nook and cranny. All these make for a fantastic game. Unfortunately, I find the character's movement too slow. At times, the collisions seem out of place so your spells don't quite hit properly or you collide with a wall in a weird way.  Furthermore, despite the 8 elements to create fun combinations, I find myself always falling back to the same ones (Earth armour), and the Arcane + Shield land mines. Enemies fly all over the place while being dealt massive amounts of damage. And this makes the game unchallenging.  Don't get me wrong. I think this would be a fun game to play with friends. I even picked it up recently to see if I would enjoy it more a second time around. Perhaps this game is simply not for me. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/MattBSG/recommended/233450,1, This game I picked up on the steam summer sale, and I only wish to say that I wish that I had payed full price to help fund these awesome people.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/alixey/recommended/39210,1, Dopo tanto tempo trascorso su questo gioco, ho deciso che era ora di spendere due parole per dire la mia su questo fantastico MMO. ? difficile descrivere Final Fantasy XIV in poche parole ma cercher¨° comunque di farlo nel migliore dei modi possibile.  Amo questo gioco. ? stato l'unico MMO in grado di coinvolgermi cos¨¬ tanto dopo aver passato molto tempo su altri giochi dello stesso genere, ed ¨¨ forse l'unica alternativa valida ad ogni MMO disponibile in circolazione in ambito PvE. L'abbonamento mensile richiesto per giocare vale davvero tanto in confronto a tutti i contenuti che il gioco ha da offrire.  Final Fantasy XIV non cerca in alcun modo di essere unico nel suo genere, anzi. Segue le tendenze tipiche del mercato degli MMO e lo fa in maniera eccellente. Il gioco all'inizio pu¨° sembrare molto lento, e durer¨¤ cos¨¬ almeno per le prime settimane di gioco. Tuttavia, grazie al sistema dell'Armory System, ¨¨ possibile livellare qualsiasi tipo di classe con un unico personaggio, poich¨¦ la classe scelta viene determinata dal tipo di arma equipaggiata al momento. Le classi si dividono nei soliti tre ruoli che i giochi del genere ci hanno abituato, Tank, Healer e DPS. Eppure, ognuna riesce a diversificarsi egregiamente per le loro utilit¨¤. La maggior parte del gioco ¨¨ basato su una grande trama, degna del nome di un Final Fantasy, che va seguita a tutti i costi per poter sbloccare la maggior parte, se non tutti i contenuti attualmente disponibili nel gioco.  La storia in gran parte riesce a coinvolgere il giocatore tra le varie situazioni che verranno proposte, colpi di scena e cose del genere. C'¨¨ da dire inoltre che si basa su una lore molto profonda, piena zeppa di riferimenti ad altri giochi della serie Final Fantasy che di sicuro piaceranno ai veterani di questo brand come me. Nel momento in cui scrivo questa recensione, ¨¨ stata gi¨¤ rilasciata la prima espansione del gioco, Heavensward. Per poter accedere a tutti i contenuti proposti dall'espansione, ¨¨ necessario completare assolutamente la serie di quest della trama di A Realm Reborn. Difatti, sconsiglio l'acquisto dell'espansione se non si ha intenzione di portare subito una classe al livello 50, poich¨¦ il gioco base ha gi¨¤ per s¨¦ moltissime cose da offrire.  Il gioco ¨¨ fortemente incentrato sul PvE, con decine di dungeon, raid e battaglie con i primal. Seppur sono disponibili varie modalit¨¤ PvP, purtroppo non sono mai riuscite a coinvolgermi pi¨´ di tanto. Ci sono anche tantissime quest da fare, giornaliere e settimanali e molte cose da sbloccare, tra cui achievement e varie ricompense.  La cosa bella di questo gioco ¨¨ che ¨¨ il giocatore a decidere cosa fare, e non l'opposto. Essendo estremamente non lineare, ¨¨ possibile scegliere come intraprendere la propria avventura nel mondo di Eorzea nel migliore dei modi. C'¨¨ da dire inoltre che la curva di apprendimento e molto morbida e riesce a guidare molto bene il giocatore verso le varie attivit¨¤ che il gioco propone.  Concludo dicendo che Final Fantasy XIV riesce in maniera eccellente a prendere le fondamenta degli MMO e a farli combinare in modo sublime. Se siete dei giocatori in cerca di un buon MMO da giocare, direi che Final Fantasy XIV ¨¨ pi¨´ che consigliato. Se siete alla ricerca di un MMO che vi proponga sempre nuove avventure da intraprendere ogni volta che si effettua l'accesso al gioco, ci riesce alla grande. Se state cercando un MMO che vi dia delle grandi soddisfazioni in ambito PvE, beh, allora non avete altre scuse.  Ci si vede su Eorzea, avventurieri.

However, what happened next surprised me. Ubisoft didn't abandon this game like other companies would have done instead. They managed the situation very nicely, acknowledged that there were some issues, and updated the game constantly with new heroes, maps, gamemodes, cosmetic items, and dedicated servers, all for free. And this is not going to change, because new contents are planned for many years to come. Just take a look at the WEEKLY livestreams they do on Twitch to see what I'm talking about.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/DaBonn/recommended/391540,-1, &quot;Mediocrity that makes blatant use of nostalgic love for much better games. Sold entirely on the word of hipsters that want to be in on the ground floor of the newest hit. Do not buy or play this game. Don't even play it even if you didn't pay for it. Leave the steaming turd on the sidewalk where it belongs.&quot; -anonymous, 2015  1/10 clever usage of viral marketing to brainwash sheeple into actually believing this is worth anybodys time and/or money 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/DaBonn/recommended/580020,-1, This season pass was an easy scam, make people pay for characters that you get paid for by the companies that made these characters to begin with, thanks scamco.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/DaBonn/recommended/335300,1, Playing this makes me think they actually shipped the wrong version last year.  Graphics aside, the changed enemy and item placement alone make this a worthy purchase for anyone who likes the Souls-series.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/synthzsteam/recommended/583950,-1, Enter the Pay2Pay era!  Awesome production value, great mechanics, beautiful lore, but the game is built around a single purpose, to dump money into it. Everything requires payment, including the competitive mode, and as of now, there's no ladders, rankings or a progression system, not even achievements, imagine that. If you're not planning to dump hundreds of euros on a digital card game, steer away from it.  Valve is a real dissapointment these days, they've lost touch with their crowd, no longer a fan.
