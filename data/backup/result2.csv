https://steamcommunity.com/id/iseenub4/recommended/253900,1, Recommended for anyone who enjoyed the Settlers, Stronghold and Cultures series. Might interest those that like base-building as this RTS is more focused on the Economy. The game comes with both Shattered Kingdom and Peasant Rebellion Expansion. The Multiplayer is still active! And might even be a challenge for those wanting to get competitive (See note below)  Example: To recruit units you have to first make their equipment from raw materials. For a swordman you need to make a sword, a shield and an armor. To make those you need to mine iron and smelt it, additionally you will need coal for your smelting and forging. Finally you can turn a recruit into a Swordman.  All-in-all this game is a staple in old-school RTS where there is a focus on the economics. Those who enjoyed Northgard might also find this game interesting barring the graphics.  *NOTE* To run this game on modern machines go download the free HD remake called KaM Remake at  http://www.kamremake.com/  The HD patch will let the game run in window mode and can also stretch to widescreen resolution  This game goes on discount quite often, give it a go if you like old-school RTS games

https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/341950,1, Lux Delux is a Risk style game, similar in many ways to the original but with several extra features. Although the game mechanics are very simple, the strategy is often quite challenging.   https://youtu.be/DTupYOTo90Q  Probably the most outstanding feature of this game is that there are over 900 maps available, providing endless variety in the gameplay. Most of these are created by users so the quality varies widely, but there are more than enough good maps to keep you occupied.   https://youtu.be/vkfetLs8z0g  Another great feature is the AI, which is really well programmed. There's around a dozen bots of different difficulty levels, each of which has a different playstyle. The hard bots are REALLY tough to beat! Additionally there's multiplayer so there's plenty of humans to go up against.  Graphics are pretty basic, but they're perfectly functional for this kind of game. Many of the maps are really well designed.  It's a fairly quick game to play, although it can take longer on some bigger maps or against tougher opponents, so it's great for when you have 10 or 20 minutes to spare.  I recommend this for anyone who craves a quick strategy fix but doesn't have enough time for a full game of Civ 5 or Hearts of Iron 3! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/iseenub4/recommended/351910,-1, This game is a dissapointment, being a fan of the Cultures series I have to admit that the dumbed down mechanics are just horrible. Vikings just fall out of from the sky, and the game has been so streamlined that all you have to do is just mass-manufacture axes and head for the gate. It feels like a half???????product and moreover the devs are trying to get money for DLCs only add biomes to the randomly generated maps which are by themselves lackluster.  Despite buying this game on release, and rooting for it. I cannot recommend purchasing the game in its state. It feels incomplete and has no storyline. You just repeat the same thing over and over again, which is try to get to the gate and accumulate karma points... 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/241560,1, The Crew is a multiplayer always-online arcade-racer set in a huge open world which is a condensed version of the United States. It was designed by many of the same people who created Test Drive Unlimited, so it can effectively be thought of as TDU 3. It contains many of the same features, but not all (no houses or shops).   http://youtu.be/CBYh4vPmH2k  I think many people are unfairly critical of this game, and are failing to appreciate the best feature, the huge open world. In reality, the world area is only around 5000 sq km (about a quarter of the size of Wales), yet that's still a huge size for a game world, possibly the second largest open world racing game (Fuel is over twice as big). Road wise, there's 10,000 km of roads, 10 times as much as in the first TDU game, so that will take a long time to explore properly. But it's not just the size of the world that's impressive, it's the attention to detail and the huge number of landmarks. It's extremely well designed.  The USA is not only condensed, but distorted, some areas are much larger than others. This is necessary since if everything was to scale, every city would be a tiny village. Instead, the biggest cities are made much larger, as well as features like the Grand Canyon, while less interesting areas are shrunk in size. The result is greatly distorted, but it feels really good to drive around, and I believe it does a good job of representing the &quot;highlights&quot; of the USA in a way which suits a computer game very well.   https://youtu.be/vNx4FtHofwU  Many people have complained about the horrible car physics. I was a bit shocked at this too in the beginning, but it turns out that the early cars handle badly by design, and get much better as you upgrade them with parts. The few cars I've tried from the DLCs handle much better. It also takes a little while to tweak your wheel or controller settings to get it to feel good, but it's worth the effort.   http://youtu.be/KksGtk6F-i8  Apparently rubber banding is also a problem in the game, although I did read someone say it's been fixed. I've noticed it a few times with police chases, but it doesn't seem to be much of a problem to me. Speaking of police chases, I find them to be a lot of fun, while others seem to hate them. Similarly, the raid challenges can be quite frustrating, but are also fun to me. Depends on your point of view I suppose.  The GPS tends to provide the shortest route between two points, which is often not the best way to get to where you want quickly (taking you through backstreets instead of sticking to main roads), but hey, SatNav does that in real life too! Just think of it as a guide that you don't have to stick to. Learning the main roads and using your &quot;local knowledge&quot; instead can save time! Also it tends to suggest offroad shortcuts, which can be annoying if you want to stick to roads, but on the other hand, it gives you a route through difficult scenery which you might otherwise get stuck in.  One annoying thing I have noticed is graphical glitches during the cut scene intros to most missions. Don't know what's causing this, but it's only a minor irritation, it doesn't happen when I'm driving.  Another slight peeve is that much of the terrain is too destructible, you can drive straight through lamp posts and other features as if they weren't even there, yet some are rock solid. It's sometimes hard to know which is which. Okay, so it's just an arcade game so you could say it's excusable, but it does lead to bad driving habits, driving through obstacles that you'd normally avoid. In fact, to win certain missions it's often a good idea to crash through things.   https://youtu.be/blIdOUmGMh8  Same goes for crashing into other cars, often (not always) this has little or no effect, barely slowing you down in most instances. Again, I don't like this because it encourages bad driving habits, not caring about hitting other cars when normally you should try to avoid them at all costs. But again, it's an arcade game, so I can live with it.  Sure, there are a few faults with this game, but most of them hardly matter to me. The game world is so large, with so many places to go, so many things to see (there's educational info on historical landmarks) and so many cars to drive (not a huge selection, but there are many variants of each, and who needs hundreds of cars anyway?) that I'm having too much fun cruising and exploring to take much notice of the faults. I think if people focused less on the faults and concentrated more on the fun aspects of the game, they'd enjoy it a lot more.  For me the FreeDrive mode is the real game, going on road trips solo or with friends. I dont' really care about the missions and the story that much (although they do add a nice bit of character to the game), I just want to explore America!  Having said that, the game gets more interesting the deeper you get into it. As you level up you unlock factions and faction missions, and that adds a lot more fun to the game, not to mention money! Some say that money is hard to come by and there's a lot of grinding, but they're wrong, money is easy to make. It's not a &quot;pay to win&quot; game, you can pay if you're lazy, but you can make it easily enough by simply playing the game.  I'm really enjoying The Crew and I highly recommend it to positive gamers who enjoy exploring a huge open world, who don't mind the arcadey gameplay and can live with a few faults. Be sure to get the Gold Edition or buy the Season Pass to get a bunch of good cars that unlock fairly early in the game, to give you a decent variety of cars to go free roaming in, otherwise you'll be stuck with the early cars for a while.  Negative focused nit-pickers need not apply! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/512350,1, I finally put a lot of hours into CAU last night, going through all 12 of the new police missions, buying all the police cars, doing several crate delivery missions (as a bad guy) and joining in several police chases (to stop the bad guy). I also levelled up to 60 in the process.  My opinion is that the new chases are great fun. They add a new dimension to the gameplay, which frankly has become a little stale after 500+ hours in the game. The police chases freshen it up a lot. It's much more exciting to be chased by real players than the AI police, while chasing down and arresting real players is extremely satisfying.  However, the DLC is very poor value for money, unless you don't own Wild Run, in which case it's great value for money because you get both. If you've already purchased Wild Run, then it's a bit of a rip off. They really should have sold it at a discount for Wild Run owners.  The good news: you don't have to own CAU to be a criminal and do the crate delivery missions, so everybody gets half of the new content for free!  The bad news: there are only 12 new missions and the story is pretty much non-existent. Unlike the original story missions there are no cut-scenes for most of them, so we don't even get to see the bad guy we're after. We're just chasing a name. The missions don't take long to complete, I did them all in an hour or so, and I got no sense of satisfaction or connection to the so called story. I expected a lot more, like the original story that was much more engaging.  Having said that, the new missions are a lot of fun and I spent a lot of time repeating many of them, trying to score platinum in each. That's a very quick way to level up your police cars. Due to the nature of the chases, they can be different each time. In fact, doing badly is more fun than catching them quickly because you get a longer chase to enjoy.  The real fun though, is chasing (or being chased by) real players rather than the idiot AI who are usually quite easy to beat (except on the harder missions). And of course, there are a few new cars available and being a cop in supercar is really cool.  In summary: It's a lot of fun and I'm really enjoying it, but it's very poor value for money if you already own Wild Run. If you love this game, you've probably bought it already, but if you haven't, why not? If you don't have Wild Run, it's very good value. If you're on the fence, wait for a sale.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/211500,1, RaceRoom is an excellent sim racer made by the same people behind Simbin, makers of Race 07 and other great sims. It's worthy of serious consideration by everyone who loves sim racing. Don't be fooled by the many bad reviews, there's a good reason for them, which I'll explain later. There's also more good news later.   https://youtu.be/itBXrA2QEEM   http://youtu.be/I7URfx-CpwE  Raceroom offers a large collection of cars (75 in total) and tracks (25 in total, many of which have several different layouts) and 3 competitions (2 DTM and ADAC) which are called &quot;Experiences&quot;. These Experiences give you full seasons with teams and drivers. In short, there's a lot of variety in this game.  I haven't put many hours into this game yet, but so far I've found the racing &quot;experience&quot; to be extremely good. Physics are very realistic and the AI seems pretty good too. One very nice feature is the ARI (Adapative Racing Intelligence) which adjusts the difficulty level automatically to match your skill and experience. At first I wasn't impressed with this since the AI drivers were driving too slowly, but apparently the difficulty level starts low and increases over time. After a few races the AI had adapted to my level and started to provide some decent competition without being overly difficult to beat.  There are three racing modes; Novice, Amateur and Get Real. Novice is a bit of a joke since it actually brakes for you as you approach the corners. Amateur has realistic physics, but with traction control, ABS and zero damage. Get Real turns the driving aids off (but damage is still optional). It's a pity I couldn't configure all these things separately, I'd like to have driven on Amateur level but with damage turned on for example.  Now the bad news...  Many people have criticised this game for being free to play but with very little content. That's true, but what do you expect for free? You get 5 different cars and 3 tracks (each with several variations), more than enough to evaluate the quality of the game and give you some great racing fun for no more than the price of the download.  Think of it this way, the &quot;free to play&quot; game is just a demo, the REAL game is in the addon packs. Three of the DLCs currently available on Steam are &quot;Experiences&quot; - full seasons with tracks and cars - DTM 2013 and 2014, ADAC 2014. It actually makes more sense to buy these as DLCs rather than buying a whole new game every year, as with the F1 games. The fourth DLC is just a car pack, not an &quot;Experience&quot;.  Here's where the problems begin...  The three Experience DLCs contain a lot of duplicate content. They mostly use the same tracks and some of the same cars. For example, the two DTM packs only have 1 track and 1 car different. This makes buying all the DLCs a waste of money, because you're paying for mostly the same content that you've already bought.  To confuse matters even more, there are many more packs you can buy that aren't available as Steam DLCs, as well as individual cars and tracks, some of which are not available in any packs. You can buy them in-game or from their website. These are bought using the in-game currency of vRP points, so you can't see what they cost in real money. However, if you add the items to your cart you can see the cost.  I created a spreadsheet to show what's available in each pack, which you may find helpful;   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=445609150  Whoever came up with this ridiculous marketing/sales model should be fired. It confuses buyers and can result in wasted money buying duplicate content. Judging by the number of negative reviews, this has backfired on them, which is a pity. I hope they don't go bankrupt again because of this!  Fortunately, there is some good news...  While experimenting with adding various packs to the cart on their website, I discovered that they DON'T CHARGE FOR DUPLICATE CONTENT! They know what cars and tracks you own, so you don't pay extra for what you already have. So if you already own DTM 2013, DTM 2014 will be cheaper as a result. I wanted to buy all the tracks but was loathe to buy the European Track Pack for just one extra track, but when I added it to my cart, it cost less than a pound extra, less than half the price of buying that track individually!  So, it's okay to buy ONE Experience pack from Steam, but if you want any more, buy them from their site instead. Also, don't worry about duplicate content, you won't be charged for it.  Even more good news, the more packs you buy at one time, the cheaper they get. There's a cumulative discount, so if you're going to buy any packs, buy as many as you can afford to save more money. I bought 7 items and got a 16% discount. If you buy all the packs I think you get a discount of around 30%  To give you an idea of cost, I spent less than ?30 to get all the tracks and about a third of the cars. I could have gotten all of the tracks cheaper than that, but I wanted some extra cars as well. Two tracks are not contained in any pack. Buying all the packs would cost around ?70 I think, but unless you're a collector who has to have everything, it doesn't need to cost that much.  CONCLUSION: I highly recommend this game to all sim racers. Those who prefer casual or arcade racing should probably avoid this game (but by all means try the &quot;demo&quot; first). The DLCs, packs and points method of selling this game is overly complex and confusing, but if you like this game, don't be put off by that, it's well worth the hassle, and it's much cheaper to buy the extras direct from the game or their website, NOT FROM STEAM!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/416080,1, In this game you play as the goddess Athena, who's job it is to guide Odysseus' boats to safety. You do this by altering the wind strength, which always blows toward their destination, and by dragging your mouse through the sea to create currents.  This sounds simple enough, but you also have to prevent the ships from hitting rocks and sand bars, and avoiding other dangers like a cyclops throwing rocks at them (you can catch the rocks by clicking on them with the mouse). Additionally you need to direct the boats to statues to unlock gates and there are also bonuses to pick up along the way. Naturally it gets harder as you progress, with newer dangers and more difficult maps to negotiate.  Although the graphics are pleasing, the resolution is only 640x480. You have a choice of full screen or windowed.  To be honest, it's not my type of game and it didn't hold my interest for very long, but it's by no means a bad game. It wouldn't appeal to everyone, but it's fairly challenging and I'm sure some gamers would enjoy it.  Conclusion: a decent casual game ideal for a quick play when you don't have much time to spare.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/438340,1, Drizzlepath: Genie is a walking simulator that takes you on a journey through beautiful scenery. The rain soaked atmosphere is very relaxing. It's not as dark as Dear Esther. The colours are quite muted, but that's appropriate for an overcast day. The landscape contains various locations and objects of interest and it's worth looking around to find things you might otherwise miss.  Occasional voice narration enhances the experience. It's extremely poetic and descriptive, painting pictures in words to further enhance the visuals. There's also relaxing music providing a soundtrack to your journey. It's pleasant enough to listen to but can get repetitive at times. I usually turn music off once that happens (which it does with all games), and often play without music or replace it with music of my own choice. It would be nice to have that option added. It's enjoyable enough just listening to the rain IMO.  There are many excellent opportunities for screenshots in this game, which can extend the gameplay time considerably. There's a control to zoom out to give a wider angle of view and another to crouch, which can provide you with a different viewpoint. You can even change to a grainy, monochrome view which gives a completely different look to the game, and is good for &quot;arty&quot; screenshots.  In spite of the overcast sky, sunlight does stream through gaps in the clouds. Unusually it shines from multiple directions. Perhaps this planet orbits multiple suns? This sunlight causes purple lens flare, which often looks appealing, but sometimes I felt there was a bit too much of it and I wished I could turn it off. UPDATE: If you set filter effects to medium or low the lens flare will be disabled.  It may be worth noting that I have not experienced any of the micro-stutters than mrorange mentioned in his review.  I don't understand what everything means in this game because I haven't completed it yet. In fact, I've only been exploring the green path so far (there are two different paths through the game), but after three hours I think I've experienced enough to write this review. I'll update it once I've played more. Unfortunately I suffer from motion sickness in first person games so I can't play them for too long without feeling ill. I also take loads of screenshots so it'll take me a lot longer to complete than if I simply walked through it all without stopping.  Overall this is a very pleasant visual and aural experience (rather than a game) which I recommend to anyone who enjoys simply walking around and looking at beautiful scenery. It's a treat to the senses and is ideal for relaxation when you feel like taking a break from more demanding games.  Disclaimer: a key was provided by the developer in return for an unbiased review, which is the only kind of review I'm willing to write. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/iseenub4/recommended/351910,-1, This game is a dissapointment, being a fan of the Cultures series I have to admit that the dumbed down mechanics are just horrible. Vikings just fall out of from the sky, and the game has been so streamlined that all you have to do is just mass-manufacture axes and head for the gate. It feels like a half???????product and moreover the devs are trying to get money for DLCs only add biomes to the randomly generated maps which are by themselves lackluster.  Despite buying this game on release, and rooting for it. I cannot recommend purchasing the game in its state. It feels incomplete and has no storyline. You just repeat the same thing over and over again, which is try to get to the gate and accumulate karma points... 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/260330,1, Flockers is an action puzzle game in much the same style as Lemmings, created by Team17, makers of Worms, so you know the pedigree is good.   https://youtu.be/YQXgOCYvZFg  For those who don't remember the classic Lemmings, it was a game in which a number of &quot;lemmings&quot; (which looked more like human workers to me) were released and would walk through the landscape, following each other like the archetypal lemmings, blindly walking off cliffs to their death. Your job as the player was to guide the lemmings by giving specific instructions to them, for example to build bridges or dig into the landscape, in order to guide as many of them to safety as possible.  Flockers uses essentially the same concept, but with sheep instead of lemmings. Appropriately so, since sheep also have the habit of following one another. This time around, rather than natural landscapes, you have to help them navigate through extremely dangerous factory complexes, filled with saws, spikes, hammers and other nasty objects, often with gory results as your mindless sheep stroll blindly into them.  Each level is a puzzle. They're large, and get progressively more complicated as you progress through them. You can zoom in and out to get a better view of the puzzle you have to solve. Sheep may wander off in different directions, you may meet more sheep along the way, transporters teleport sheep to different locations and it can sometimes be a bit confusing to understand what's going on the first time you try a new level.  As you go through each level, sheep step on buttons which activate machinery, sometimes in a good way, sometimes in a very bad way, so you have to be very careful what you let them step on. They also encounter crates, which when opened give you new abilities that you can assign to your your sheep. It may take a few attempts to figure out how to get through a level.  While you often need to get only one sheep to safety (in the early levels at least), getting more will score you more points, as will doing it in a faster time. You also get a bonus for using fewer abilities. You can retry levels to get a better score, and you can compare your score to your friends.  The levels are very detailed, perhaps overly so, which can make it tricky to figure out how to solve them. But maybe that's the point, distracting you with unimportant details. Fortunately, although it's an action game, you can pause it at any time, giving you the opportunity to study the puzzle at your leisure. You still have to solve it in real time though, giving commands to your sheep as they move. Pressing the right mouse button gives you a bigger &quot;brush&quot;, enabling you to give commands to multiple sheep at the same time.  The graphics are very good, and very gory as sheep get smashed and sawed, spiked and gored, with blood splattering everywhere, which is rather amusing if you find that sort of thing funny. For this reason the game has an age rating. But if you don't like that sort of thing, you can simply turn off the gore in the video options.  I haven't played this game for very long yet, but my first impressions are very good. I'm finding it both challenging and amusing, an enjoyable casual way to pass the time. The price is very reasonable and it's on sale at the moment, so this is a great time to grab it if you're interested.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/70210,1, Governor of Poker 2 is an enjoyable poker game set in the Wild West, that offers more than just poker. There's a long campaign where you travel to different cities, play in various tournaments, encounter a variety of different opponents (including notorious ones), purchase buildings, and best of all, you get to buy new hats!   https://youtu.be/obuXfORI8v0  A big feature of real poker is the tells on your opponents faces, but in this game you don't see faces, just hats! In spite of this, the game does a pretty good job of giving different personalities to the characters through their voices and actions, and there are tells in the form of comments they make and other information, such as getting steamy when they lose.  A big part of the game is travelling to different cities and buying buildings, which provide you with passive income. At first you can only make money from playing poker, but once you own a reasonable number of buildings you have a steady income trickling in. The idea is to build up your reputation and take over different cities. You can borrow money from the bank if necessary, or sell buildings if you have any, and of course, you can buy new hats. New hats impart some personality to the players and allow you to enter new tournaments.  The gameplay is fairly fast paced, it's an ideal game for a quick poker fix, but I'm not sure whether the cards played are truly random and whether the AI cheats or not. Some reviews claim that it does. I'm not experienced at poker so I can't really tell, but as a casual player the gameplay seems decent to me, even though I find it pretty hard to win, even on the standard level. The Telltale poker games are a lot more fun if you want personality and banter, but for a simple poker fix, this does the job and is better than other poker games I've tried. There's no multiplayer, so look elsewhere if that's what you want, but it provides a good single player experience  The graphics are fairly basic, and low res too, but they're functional and pleasant to look at. There are free versions of this you can play on the internet but this version, the premium edition, provides more depth.  Overall I'd recommend this game for casual players, especially because of the extra interest that the campaign provides. Serious poker players may want to look elsewhere though.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/446800,1, This game is the spiritual successor to Transport Tycoon, but brought up to date in full 3D glory. First impressions are very good. On the surface it looks just like Train Fever with ships and planes added, but there's a lot more to it than that. It runs on a new game engine for a start, which solves the worst problem of the previous game, namely track and road laying, which could often be extremely frustrating. It's still not perfect, but it's considerably improved, with far more complex track connections possible.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=796614848  The scenery is a lot more detailed when you look closely at it, with many more different buildings in the towns. The vehicle models are really well done, and they become dirty and rusty over time. Distant scenery blends better into the background with a misty effect.  The most significant change is that they've done away with the 20 minute rule and replaced it with catchment areas, which is probably more familiar in these types of games. Journeys can be of any length now, but passengers still prefer quicker transport. With freight it doesn't matter so much, especially with ships that can carry huge amounts of cargo but travel very slowly.  Along with that, resources and products no longer move on their own, instead you have to transport everything yourself and place stations in appropriate catchment areas to ensure that everything gets delivered to the right places. Industries now have more complex resource requirements. If part of the supply chain is missing it will grind to a halt. This makes the game more challenging compared to Train Fever, in which you could provide partial transport routes and the AI would automatically fill in the gaps.  In keeping with the more complex industries, there are now six different types of products that need to be transported to towns, three to the commercial districts and three to the industrial districts. This makes things even more complex since you need to use more depots to ensure the town is well supllied, although you apparently only need to supply one industrial and one commercial product (in addition to passenger transport) to help cities grow, making the more complex industrial chains seem somewhat unnecessary.  Regarding money, even on the easy level there can be a lot of time spent waiting to make a profit  from your lines before you can expand, and the harder levels are much more difficult. If you prefer to build without limits, you can apply a mod which removes money from the game, but you don't get any achievements in that mode.  In addition to the main random game, there are also two campaigns included, one for Europe and one for the USA, featuring several scenarios each. I haven't tried these myself, but they provide you with a story and clear goals to win each scenario. They're probably a good way to help learn the game if you haven't played Train Fever previously.  To sum up, Transport Fever can be very engrossing. Personally I'm finding it just as addictive as Civilization, but instead of &quot;one more turn&quot; there's always one more line to create, a new train to build, vehicles to upgrade, a line to update or some other problem to solve. &quot;I'll just finish doing this then I'll go to bed, but I need to sort out that problem first, oh and there's that other thing I need to look at, and while I'm at it...&quot;  If you enjoy these types of games, this is a no brainer. We've been waiting a very long time for a spiritual successor to Transport Tycoon. Many similar games have come and gone over the years, but this is the first that truly deserves that accolade. It's the best game in the genre in my opinion.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/445020,1, The single player game mode is the new city mode, where factions vie for control and all are battling a common enemy. Money, earned by completing story-based missions or contracts for a faction, is used to purchase new units. Units are divided into squads that can roam around the city, and regenerate when killed. Missions take place inside (or adjacent to) procedurally-generated buildings that offer good variety in tactics. Some levels lack satellite coverage (hiding enemy movement) or contain locked windows or doors that must be opened in specific areas. The city game is a fun enhancement to the core gameplay, as the different alliances and mission types provide variety each play through. The tactical game has received improvements as well, starting with a large roster of new unit types (including riot shield, scoped rifle, knife, smoke and toxic grenades, mines, flamethrower, minigun, and turret). These new units open up more tactical possibilities in each game. Units can be instructed to focus on a certain portion of the map, and a ¡°focus diamond¡± can be played for increased accuracy. Large levels can be traversed in fewer turns using the ¡°long turn¡± option. Keeping units still, behind cover, and aiming in the correct direction still results in the best outcomes. The computer opponents are smart (most of the time) and provide good adversaries. Of course, online play is also available using simultaneous turn resolution and turns that can be submitted at your leisure. All of the previous game modes are available (extermination, charge, disputed, secure, hostage), plus quicker one-turn challenges. Frozen Synapse 2 has enough significant content through the robust city mode, vastly improved procedurally generated levels, and interesting new units to justify its existence.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSre1B_H3Og  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/888610,-1, The game features three short campaigns (11 scenarios total) at various difficulties, plus five sandbox maps; there are no random maps to extend the content. The goal is to make money by collecting resources, transporting those resources to factories to produce goods, then selling those goods. There are some multi-step production chains in the game (iron + oil &gt; plastic + steel + engine &gt; mower) that add complexity and require planning. However, it is extremely difficult to turn a profit early on in each campaign scenario (the sandbox maps have infinite money), as goods do not earn enough money to offset the expensive monthly maintenance costs for the factories and mines required to make those goods. Oligopoly is a potentially interesting economic strategy game with intricate production chains ruined by poor early game balance in the campaign mode.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lx6HjTjOfU  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/788700,1, The game features a campaign that consists of a series of semi-random scenarios where you must construct defenses and and army to fend off enemies that will appear after a set period of time; once you lose, you have to start over from the beginning so there is only one saved game slot. Workers are assigned to collect resources, construct buildings, make weapons, or constitute your army. Town size can be increased by building houses with wells nearby, and food must be produced every four turns to support your population. Random events, such as merchants that will trade resources for gold and monsters that attack before the end of the scenario, mix things up mid-game. Combat is performed in real-time, where units are given move and attack orders and use special abilities. Units will attack nearby enemies to reduce micromanagement. The AI is basic but only needs to be in a defensive game. Ultimately, ValeGuard is a game of resource management, assigning the correct number of workers to collect and produce the right goods in order to have enough troops and defenses to fend off the final attack. While the mechanics are somewhat repetitive, there is flexibility regarding which weapons and resources to focus on. Overall, ValeGuard is an enjoyable defensive strategy game with a management slant.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVnV-zqE-38

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Alcohol_Fueled_Brewtality/recommended/816090,-1, It really pains me to leave a negative review on this. The art design and assets are top-notch and reeks W40K out of every orifice. Unfortunately the game itself isn't anywhere near as polished to the point of frustration.   - No dedicated servers. Matchmaker displays no ping or useful information whatsoever to tell you the quality of the host. Oh and if you disconnect, crash or the host leaves you lose all progress/rewards. Not a good combo.   - Class information is impossible to find unless you know exactly where to look. In fact there is only one screen that displays what the various class abilities actually do. What screen you ask? The in-game loadout. Yes, you actually have to start up a match if you want to read about the abilities! Furthermore this information is poorly displayed. You'd think you'd just see the class abilities and their icons and hover the mouse over them or something, right? No, they're hidden under some kind of awkward &quot;level up&quot; system.   - Rewards are given out in a Lootbox(TM) fashion. Of course, you don't have to buy them with money or anything but Lootboxes(TM) with a random reward for each level-up is a horrid way to hand out rewards even if you don't have to pay for it. I've not gotten a single useful thing for any of the classes I prefer. Woopee.   - No Single Player &quot;level replay system&quot;. The campaign features various collectibles and not being able to easily select and replay a beaten Chapter is asenine, quite frankly. You have to start the Campaign over entirely if you miss any of them since the game only has a few save slots and overwrites them with each new Chapter. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Alcohol_Fueled_Brewtality/recommended/378540,1, Pros:   - A return to Dark Souls 1-type of exploration. Relies less on connected smaller areas like Dark Souls 2 and 3 but instead you have a very large enviroment to explore in which you unlock shortcuts to make traversing it quicker as you go. I very much prefer this style, so it is a big plus.   - Enjoyable and meaty melee combat. I daresay it is even better than Dark Souls in some regards, especially when it comes to the bigger and heavier stuff which feel properly impactful and while still slow they flow a lot better than the Greatweapons of Dark Souls.   - Controls perfectly fine with mouse and keyboard. We all know how notoriously bad the Dark Souls-series is on this point, but The Surge definitely pulls it off flawlessly.   - Runs perfectly fine, even on my gaming laptop which is in the middle-ground between &quot;Minimum&quot; and &quot;Recommended&quot; specs.   - POISE! PRAISE THE SUN! The type of exo-skeleton rig you are wearing has stat akin to Poise in Dark Souls, only it actually matters - a lot! When you are wearing the lighter and more agile rigs, you are often sent flying into the air if you are unfortunate enough to get hit by an enemy with a heavy weapon. Wearing the beefiest rigs will not only reduce the damage taken, but keep your feet firmly planted on the ground!  Cons:   - No character creation whatsoever. Now this could be excused if the main character was written in such a way that his set of characteristics were central to the plot, but not as much. There is one spoilerific characteristic he has at the start of the game, but that could easily be given to anyone else. The role he plays could be filled by a myriad of different people.   - No online component whatsoever. Whether you loved it or hated it, the multiplayer aspect is a huge part of the Soulslike-experience and it is definitely noticable in it's absence.   - Retains the dumbest gimmick from Lords of The Fallen: You won't get the &quot;proper&quot; boss weapon unless you defeat the boss while meeting a specific condition. There is no way to know what that condition is in-game as you are fighting them,  forcing you to either spoil the game for yourself by Googling all the bosses and what to do or to miss out on the good version of their weapon. While there is NG+ to let you fight them again, the bosses can't be re-fought in your current NG.  Overall I'd still recommend the game because I feel the positives heavily, heaaavily outweights the negatives. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/806950,1, The game features three campaigns but two are initially locked. In addition, the first campaign contains a mandatory tutorial that cannot be skipped, even if it¡¯s not your first time playing. The campaign allows for free-form movement of fleets around the Pacific to achieve objectives but lacks a skirmish mode. Fleets can be instructed to attack, defend, move, recon, raid, or resupply. The game takes place in real-time and any conflicts can be skipped. ¡°War bonds¡± earned during missions can be used to purchase new ships, and experience points will unlock additional vessels. Tactical battles involve movement orders, speed adjustments, firing guns, and launching aircraft. Units will attack and maneuver automatically if issued general ¡°attack¡± commands, reducing micromanagement. Units can also be organized into squadrons that act as a single entity. Specific systems can be damaged during combat, and the AI provides decent opposition. Victory At Sea Pacific is a neat idea thanks to its persistent, non-linear campaign but lacks some ancillary features to fully round out the package.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQN4_Ec0QOI  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jimraynor/recommended/290790,1, Grey Goo ist ein klassisches old-school Echtzeitstrategiespiel. Es orientiert sich haupts?chlich an den ersten Command &amp; Conquer-Teilen, der Entwickler Petroglyph besteht aus vielen ex-Westwood-Mitarbeitern, auch wenn es optisch eher an StarCraft erinnert. Es spielt sich jedoch deutlich langsamer als StarCraft und erfordert kaum Micromanagement (die Einheiten haben keine Spezialf?higkeiten) sondern konzentriert sich auf Macromanagement (Einheitenzahl und -zusammensetzung sowie Basisbau an sich).  In Grey Goo gibt es drei Fraktionen, die Menschen, Beta und Goo. W?hrend sich Menschen und Beta bei den Einheiten sehr ?hneln und fast gespiegelt sind, unterscheidet sich der Basisbau bei beiden grunds?tzlich. Die Goo sind v?llig einmalig, da sie weder ¨¹ber Basenbau verf¨¹gen und sich auch bei den Einheiten extrem unterscheiden.  Die Kampagne bietet pro Fraktion 5 Missionen und erz?hlt eine zusammenh?ngende Geschichte, in der man erst Beta, dann Menschen und abschlie?end Goo spielt. Die Geschichte wird durch herausragende CGI-Filme erz?hlt, die selbst Blizzard Konkurrenz machen, sowie kurzen Missionsbriefings mit animierten Charakteren und Meldungen in den Missionen. Durch den kostenpflichtigen DLC wird die Kampagne um 3 weitere Missionen erg?nzt, 1 f¨¹r die Menschen und 2 f¨¹r die Goo, und die Story des Hauptspiels erg?nzt. Trotz der herausragenden CGI-Filme gewinnt die Story zwar keinen Oscar, ist jedoch ordentlich und interessant umgesetzt, wenn auch etwas klischeebeladen. Man ben?tigt etwa 10-15 Stunden, um die Kampagne durchzuspielen.  Die Grafik von Grey Goo setzt keine neuen Meilensteine, ist aber sch?n und ansprechend umgesetzt, jedoch ?hneln sich die Einheiten teilweise zu sehr bzw. sind nur schwer zu unterscheiden, sodass man nicht immer alles auf den ersten Blick erkennt. Die musikalische Untermalung ist jedoch ¨¹ber jeden Zweifel erhaben und geh?rt mit zu dem Besten, was man im Strategiegenre zu h?ren bekommt. Komponist ist Frank Klepacki, der bereits den Soundtrack zu den ersten Command &amp; Conquers komponierte, wie dem Hell March.  Der Multiplayermodus bietet die bekannten Modi 1v1, 2v2 (jeweils ranked oder unranked), FFA oder Spiele gegen die KI. Die KI verf¨¹gt ¨¹ber mehrere Schwierigkeitsgrade (mit oder ohne cheaten) sowie Pers?nlichkeiten (Bunkern, Rushen, etc) und kann den pers?nlichen Vorlieben angepasst werden. Er ist jedoch leider auf 4 Spieler begrenzt, wodurch keine gr??eren Spiele m?glich sind. Die Fraktionen sind gr??tenteils ausbalanciert, man muss jedoch die Taktiken gegen die jeweiligen Fraktionen sowie f¨¹r einen guten Spieleinstieg kennen, um nicht v?llig unterzugehen. Grey Goo bietet jedoch die Option an, sich beliebige Replays angucken zu k?nnen, sodass man sich die Taktiken schnell und einfach von den Profis abgucken kann. Leider ist jedoch im Multiplayermodus nicht mehr allzuviel los. Haupts?chlich findet man 1v1-Ranked-Spiele, 2v2 wird kaum noch gespielt. Auf Grund der kleinen Spielerbasis findet man auch h?ufig die selben Gegner im 1v1, wodurch die Lernkurve am Anfang doch recht steil und frustrierend ist, wenn man sich keine Replays anguckt. Der Multiplayerpart wird jedoch weiterhin von den Entwicklern mit Turnieren am Leben gehalten und etwas gepushed sowie promoted, wodurch durchaus noch regelm??ig neue Spieler hinzukommen oder es kleinere Spitzen an Spielern gibt, jedoch auf einem vergleichsweise niedrigem Niveau.   Solospielzeit: etwa 10-15 Stunden Multiplayerspielzeit: 1-20 Stunden  + Klassisches Echtzeitstrategiespiel mit Basenbau + gute und abwechslungsreiche Kampagne + 3 Fraktionen mit unterschiedlicher Spielweise + Herausragende Zwischensequenzen + Hervorragender Soundtrack  +/- Einheitenauswahl ist etwas begrenzt, jedoch ausreichend  - Einheiten teilweise zu ?hnlich bzw. nur schwer unterscheidbar - Multiplayermatches auf 4 Spieler begrenzt und nur noch wenige Spieler    Fazit: Das Spiel richtet sich ganz klar an Fans der klassischen Echtzeitstrategiespiele, die mit einem Kauf nicht viel verkehrt machen k?nnen, wenn sie es prim?r f¨¹r den Singleplayerpart kaufen. Wer moderne Strategiespiele bevorzugt oder grundlegende Neuerungen im Genre erwartet, wird von Grey Goo eher entt?uscht werden. Die Erweiterung erg?nzt das Spiel um ein paar Missionen und f¨¹hrt es einem runden Ende zu. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/703880,1, The game features a story-based campaign mode, online play, and custom games against the AI or a local opponent. The three factions provide a good mix of units and spells, or you can create a custom faction using any item combination. Gold (collected by workers from mines, or from blocks scattered around the map) is used to unlock and purchase new units and buildings, while mana (collected differently for each faction, but also in block form) is used to cast spells. Units automatically move across the map and attack, so the timing of unit production (making sure a mass of units arrive at the enemy base at the same time) and proper use of spells to support an attack determines the victor. The game is very approachable but still allows for strategic variety (which units to unlock, when to attack, save up or spend, focus on defensive structure or more units). Swords and Soldiers 2 Shawarmageddon, like the original game, widens the appeal of the real-time strategy game by offering a fast, action-packed title that¡¯s easy to learn.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfQ5E_54Q24

https://steamcommunity.com/id/jimraynor/recommended/351230,1, Counter Spell ist eine interessante und kurzweilige Mischung aus Egoshooter (FPS) und Rollenspiel (RPG) und ein Geheimtipp f¨¹r Fans von Indie-Spielen.  Vom Spielgef¨¹hl spielt sich das Spiel wie ein FPS, wird jedoch um diverse klassische Elemente eines RPG erg?nzt. Es gibt verschiedene Klassen mit unterschiedlichen F?higkeiten, Levelaufstiege, Skillpunkte und man sammelt immer bessere Ausr¨¹stung, die den Charakter noch st?rker macht. Vergleichbar ist das Spiel grob mit Hexen 2 und dem etwas neueren Dark Messiah of Might and Magic.  Counter Spell verf¨¹gt ¨¹ber diverse Spielmodi. Der Questmodus ist die typische Singleplayerkampagne, bei der man die ganze Welt nach und nach erkundet. Das Spiel ist Open World, sprich man ist lediglich durch die Gegnerst?rke in seinem Vorgehen limitiert. Die Story hierbei ist eher rudiment?r, jedoch kann man mehrere B¨¹cher in der Welt finden, die die Hintergrundgeschichte recht am¨¹sant etwas vertiefen und ausf¨¹hren. Man kann die Kampagne auch Coop mit Freunden spielen. Sie dient jedoch haupts?chlich dazu, mit der Welt, den Gegner und F?higkeiten seines Charakters vertraut zu werden und dauert etwa 5 Stunden.  Anschlie?end kann man entweder dort weiter bessere Items f¨¹r seinen Charakter farmen, einen h?heren Schwierigkeitsgrad versuchen (es gibt 3), die anderen Klassen ausprobieren oder sich in einem der anderen 9 Spielmodi mit Freunden austoben. Diese sind wahlweise auf einen Sektor der Welt begrenzt oder nutzen die gesamte Weltkarte. Man hat die Wahl zwischen klassischen PVP-Modi wie Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Kingslayer, die auch teilweise interessante Abweichungen und Variationen zu den bekannten Modi bieten oder mehreren Coop-Modi mit Freunden wie das klassische Survival. In den PvP-Modi k?nnen Itemvorteile auf Wunsch deaktiviert werden, um faire Matches zu garantieren. In den Coop-Modi kann man dagegen auch bessere Ausr¨¹stung f¨¹r seinen Charakter finden.  Das Spiel liefert auch einen umfangreichen Baumodus, bei dem man wie in Minecraft eigene Karten bauen kann. Wer sich gerne kreativ austobt, kann hier mehrere Stunden verbringen.  Besonders hervorzuheben ist die herausragende Pflege des Spiels durch den Entwickler. Es gibt regelm??ige Patches mit neuen Inhalten und Bugfixes und auf Fragen oder Vorschl?ge im Forum wird innerhalb weniger Stunden reagiert. Das Spiel wird also st?ndig weiterentwickelt und verbessert, wodurch man alle paar Monate wieder reingucken kann und interessante Neuerungen findet.  Solospielzeit: 5-20 Stunden Multiplayerspielzeit: 1-20 Stunden  + Abwechslungsreiche Klassen + Unverbrauchtes und neues Spielgef¨¹hl + Sehr aktiver Entwickler, h?ufige Updates und sehr schnelle Antworten und Reaktionen im Forum + Viele spa?ige Spielmodi  +/- Der Grafikstil ist sicherlich Geschmackssache, jedoch in sich sehr sch?n und absolut stimmig  - Wenig aktive Spieler, wer Multiplayermodi spielen m?chte, sollte ein paar Freunde mitbringen. Es gibt zwar regelm??¨ªge Multiplayertreffen im Forum organisiert, jedoch aus den USA, sodass sie in Deutschland nur Nachts zwischen 2-4 Uhr stattfinden - Rudiment?re Story, wer auf eine gute Story Wert legt, wird eher entt?uscht   Fazit: Wer Indie-Spiele sowie den Grafikstil mag und gerne etwas neues ausprobiert, sollte sich Counter Spell unbedingt anschauen.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Alcohol_Fueled_Brewtality/recommended/213670,1, An Ubisoft game without the??????stain that is Uplay. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jimraynor/recommended/351910,1, Valhalla Hills ist ein klassisches Aufbaustrategiespiel und kann am Besten als eine Mischung aus Siedler 2 sowie Cultures beschrieben werden, mit einem Fokus auf den Elementen von Siedler 2. Es ist von den Entwicklern von Cultures, dessen f¨¹hrende K?pfe auch hinter Siedler 2 sowie dessen Remake Siedler 2 ¨C Die n?chste Generation standen.  Das Spielziel von Valhalla Hills ist es f¨¹r seine Wikinger, die man mit Namen und Kleidung individualisieren kann, gen¨¹gend Ehre zu sammeln, um sie nach Valhalla schicken zu k?nnen. Hierf¨¹r baut man zu Beginn klassisch seine Siedlung mit bekannten Produktionsketten auf, z.B. Holzf?ller -&gt; S?gewerk, Farm -&gt; M¨¹hle -&gt; B?ckerei, und verbindet die Geb?ude mit einem Wegesystem um deren Einzugsradius zu maximieren. Es gibt hierbei jedoch kein Tr?gersystem wie in Siedler 2, sondern die Produktionsgeb?ude holen ihre ben?tigten Rohstoffe selbstst?ndig ab. Beim Bau der Siedlung muss man noch die beiden Bed¨¹rfnisse seiner Wikinger, Hunger und M¨¹digkeit, beachten, um eine m?glichst produktive Siedlung zu erhalten. Der M¨¹digkeit ist hierbei mit Wohnh?usern in der N?he noch relativ einfach beizukommen, zumal die Wikinger notfalls auch unter einem Baum schlafen, was jedoch weniger Erholsam ist und somit l?nger ben?tigt, w?hrend hungrige Wikinger erst wieder mit vollem Magen weiterarbeiten. Daher stellt die Bereitstellung von Nahrung in der ganzen Siedlung, z.B. mit Fischern, J?gern oder B?ckern, eine besondere Herausforderung dar, gerade bei gr??eren Siedlungen.  Neben dem Aufbaupart lauern auf der Karte jedoch viele Gefahren, wie wilde Tiere, Eisriesen oder Eiszwerge, sodass man fr¨¹her oder sp?ter sein Milit?r aufr¨¹sten muss. Dieses besteht aus Axtk?mpfern und Bogensch¨¹tzen, f¨¹r die Waffen gibt es verschiedene Qualit?tsstufen, die man mit Malzbier (Leben) und Gold (Schaden) weiter verbessern kann. Die Steuerung des Milit?rs erfolgt hierbei ebenfalls indirekt, man setzt einen Sammelpunkt in dessen Radius die Wikinger selbstst?ndig Feinde attackieren. Mit Hilfe seiner Wikinger kann man sich nun langsam den Weg zum Portal freik?mpfen, um eine Insel abschlie?en und zur n?chsten Insel ¨¹bersiedeln zu k?nnen. Nach ein paar Inseln gesellen sich noch die Zwerge zu den Gegnertypen, die nach einer gewissen Zeit durch Portale an die Oberfl?che durchbrechen und damit beginnen, die Insel ebenfalls zu besiedeln. Sie werden mit der Zeit immer st?rker und zahlreicher, um fr¨¹her oder sp?ter auch Angriffe auf die eigene Siedlung zu starten. Sie stellen hierbei eine besondere Herausforderung dar und man muss wohl¨¹berlegt gegen sie vorgehen. Da man mit K?mpfen jedoch mit Abstand die meiste Ehre sammelt, sollte man sich nicht nur auf die Portale konzentrieren, sondern aktiv den Kampf mit allen Gegnern auf einer Karte zu suchen. Wer jedoch ungerne in Aufbauspielen k?mpft, dann die Zwerge als Gegner auch abschalten, um sich mehr auf den Aufbaupart konzentrieren zu k?nnen.  Das Spiel wird hierbei entweder im sogennanten progressiven Modus gespielt, der auch gleichzeitig als Tutorial dient, bei dem Geb?ude nach und nach freigeschaltet werden und die Inseln immer gr??er und schwerer werden oder es wird direkt eine Insel in beliebiger Gr??e und ausgew?hltem Schwierigkeitsgrad gestartet. Die Inseln entstammen hierbei in beiden Modi immer einem Zufallsgenerator, der f¨¹r Abwechslung sorgt und immer spielbare Karten ausw¨¹rfelt, jedoch mit unterschiedlichen Gefahren bzw. Problemen. Eine Kampagne gibt es leider nicht.  Auch wenn mir das Spiel unglaublichen Spa? macht, erreicht leider Valhalla Hills jedoch nicht ganz die Tiefe, Komplexit?t und Perfektion seiner Vorbilder. Es gibt etwas weniger Auswahl bei den verschiedenen Geb?uden und gerade bei gr??eren Siedlungen st??t das Zufallstransportsystem gerne an seine Grenzen. Man w¨¹rde gerne seine Siedlung weiter optimieren, z.B. indem man bestimmte Routen und Abholstationen einrichten w¨¹rde, jedoch gibt es hierf¨¹r keine M?glichkeiten. Nach etwa 5 Stunden hat man im progressiven Modus alle Geb?ude freigeschalten, wodurch sich der Aufbaupart darauf konzentriert, immer effektiver im Bau seiner Siedlungen zu werden. Nach etwa 10 Stunden wird mit den Zwergen ein neuer Gegnertyp eingef¨¹hrt, der eine neue Herausforderung darstellt und den man nur besiegen kann, wenn man zuvor seine Aufbauk¨¹nste perfektioniert hat. Nach etwa 15-20 Stunden hat man jedoch auch hier den Dreh raus und das Gef¨¹hl eigentlich alles gesehen zu haben. Die Herausforderung konzentriert sich dann darauf, immer gr??ere Berge zu meistern, wobei gerade die gr??t m?gliche Insel im Winterszenario und im &quot;Hard-Mode&quot; eine enorme Herausforderung darstellt.  Der Grafikstil ist mit seiner Comicgrafik sehr stimmig und passend. Es macht einfach Spa? den Wikingern bei der Arbeit zuzuschauen. Der Wuselfaktor ist definitiv vorhanden und man erwischt sich immer wieder dabei, einfach mal dem Treiben f¨¹r ein paar Minuten zuzugucken. Die Musik ist am Anfang sehr sch?n, extrem passend und eing?ngig, besteht jedoch leider nur aus 2 Titeln (1 normale Melodie und 1 Kampfmelodie), sodass man sich nach 10-20 Stunden doch irgendwann etwas mehr Abwechslung w¨¹nschen w¨¹rde.  Solospielzeit: 15-50 Stunden Multiplayerspielzeit: nicht vorhanden, wird eventuell noch erg?nzt.  + Wuselfaktor + Siedler 2-Gef¨¹hl + Sch?ner und stimmiger Grafikstil + Weiterhin Patches, Verbesserungen und neue Features/Geb?ude  +/- Zwar sehr sch?ne Musik, jedoch nur 2 Titel +/- Langzeitmotivation nach 20-30 Stunden abnehmend, jedoch trotzdem sehr ordentliche Spielzeit  - Fehlende Optimierungs- und Detailsteuerrungsm?glichkeiten - Keine wirkliche Story und Kampagne - Kein Multiplayermodus (Coop oder VS)   Fazit: Das Spiel richtet sich klar an Fans von klassischer Aufbaustrategie im Stile eines Siedler 2 oder Cultures. Trotz der erw?hnten Schw?chen empfehle ich Valhalla Hills jedoch uneingeschr?nkt allen Fans solcher Aufbaustrategiespiele. Seit Siedler 2 hat es kein Spiel mehr geschafft, mir ein ?hnlich wohliges Aufbaufeeling zu geben, sodass die St?rken eindeutig die Schw?chen ¨¹berwiegen. Auch wenn vielleicht die Suchtspirale nach 20-30 Stunden anf?ngt nachzulassen, wird man f¨¹r diese Zeit wunderbar unterhalten und m?chte auch danach immer mal wieder einen Berg in Angriff nehmen. Daher ist das Spiel jeden Cent wert. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/677340,1, The game features two introductory missions, four without combat, and four with combat. You cannot skip missions and there are no randomized maps. Each scenario is designed to take a while to complete, as key resources are usually located on opposite sides of the map; this results in lots of monotonous waiting for resource transport, even at the maximum game speed. The crux of the game is the collection and distribution of resources, starting with the basics (food, logs, iron ore, clay) and working up the production chain to more sophisticated goods (bricks, books, bread, glass, arrows). Residences are used to produce energy consumed by every building, and structures can upgrade to produce higher-level goods. The buildable area can be expanded by placing watchtowers, and the combat-focused scenarios include hostile AI opponents. There is a lot of data contained in the game concerning resource input and output rates, and keeping resource delivery travel times low and making sure you are producing the correct quantity of goods is important for success. Most resources can be produced indefinitely once you find an underground mine (with a couple exceptions, like salt), but this still requires careful expansion and resource usage until you discover those key locations. There is a significant amount of waiting for resources to accumulate (especially if your network is inefficient, which it usually is due to the scripted resource locations); this results in dull, repetitive gameplay for about half of each scenario. While The Colonists has a satisfying core of resource production and distribution, the dull, drawn-out scenarios coupled with a lack of random maps restrict the enjoyment.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUztCi7zT4s

https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/600480,1, The game features a campaign mode with scenarios that include varied starting and victory conditions; also included is a flexible sandbox mode. The goal is to expand the aquarium by placing new tanks filled with fish and other aquatic creatures; each animal has different attributes and desires (such as water temperature, grass, or caves) that must be balanced in each ecosystem. Different machines, such as filters, skimmers, heaters, and lights, can be attached to tanks to achieve the levels required by its inhabitants. Staff members will automatically feed the fish, repair broken equipment, and keep the aquarium clean. Money is earned by having popular animals on display and by selling food, drinks, and souvenirs. Animals also provide research points used to unlock new animals and equipment. The game is very approachable while still requiring some careful balancing so animal needs don¡¯t interfere. While the game can get repetitive and there is some waiting for new things to finish researching, the variety of animals and freeform expansion options buoy interest. Megaquarium is a well-executed management game.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsvBdHzXduI  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jimraynor/recommended/50300,1, Spec Ops: The Line ist ein klassischer Deckungsshooter, bei dem man aus der Deckung heraus wiederholt Gegnergruppen bek?mpfen muss, um zum n?chsten Bereich vorr¨¹cken zu k?nnen. Hierbei wird man von zwei Begleitern unterst¨¹tzt, die sowohl selbstst?ndig k?mpfen als auch gezielte Befehle des Spielers umsetzen. Auf Grund seiner Story MUSS man dieses Spiel jedoch gespielt haben.  Das herausragende Alleinstellungsmerkmal von Spec Ops: The Line ist seine Story. Sie basiert auf dem Buch &quot;Herz der Finsternis&quot; sowie dessen Verfilmung &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. Sie kommt anfangs erst langsam in Fahrt, entfaltet sich jedoch ab der H?lfte des Spiels, um am Ende einen v?llig verdutzten Spieler zur¨¹ckzulassen. In 20 Jahren Videospiele hat es kein Spiel geschafft, mich mit seiner Story so extrem zu bewegen und tagelang zu besch?ftigen. Kein Spiel vermochte es bisher auch nur ansatzweise den Irrsinn eines Krieges so eindringlich zu vermitteln. F¨¹hle ich mich wie ein Held?  W?hrend der Kampagne wird man vor mehrere, teils moralische Entscheidungen gestellt, die jedoch nicht immer offensichtlich sind und keinen Einfluss auf das Ende haben. Es gibt zwar verschiedene Enden, die sich jedoch aus den Handlungen im letzten Kapitel ergeben. Oder doch nicht?  Grafisch ist das Spiel sehr sch?n und f¨¹hrt mit dem allgegenw?rtigen Sand in Dubai ein neues, unverbrauchtes Spieleelement ein, das der Spieler zu seinen Gunsten nutzen kann oder gegen welches er ank?mpfen muss. Die musikalische Untermalung ist gro?artig und schafft es mehreren Gefechten eine unglaublich epische und coole Atmosph?re zu verpassen.  Vom reinen Gameplay her hat Spec Ops: The Line leider kleinere Schw?chen. Das Deckungssystem sowie die Steuerung haben ihre T¨¹cken und enden manchmal in ungewollten Aktionen, die zum Tod f¨¹hren k?nnen. Die KI-Begleiter verhalten sich zwar gr??tenteils intelligent, preschen manchmal jedoch etwas zu kopflos vor, wodurch sie verletzt und innerhalb einer begrenzten Zeit verarztet werden m¨¹ssen, um nicht zu verlieren. Auch das Gameplay wird mit der Zeit relativ repetitiv und etwas langweilig.  Trotz dieser Schw?chen sollte man das Spiel jedoch unbedingt durchspielen, sie werden durch die Story mehr als ausgeglichen. Der Wiederspielwert ist zwar relativ gering, wenn man die Story und seine Wendungen kennt, beim wiederholten Durchspielen findet man jedoch unz?hlige Details, die einem am Anfang verborgen blieben, sodass trotzdem ein gewisser Wiederspielwert besteht.  Das Spiel verf¨¹gt noch ¨¹ber einen Multiplayermodus sowie mehrere von der Story unabh?ngige Coop-Missionen, die man mit einem Freund spielen kann. Beides ist jedoch nur bedingt in das Spiel integriert und wirkt mehr wie &quot;drangeklatscht&quot;. Dennoch kann man mit dem Multiplayermodus und den Coop-Missionen nochmal ein paar Stunden Spa? haben, der Fokus des Spiels liegt jedoch eindeutig auf seiner Kampagne.   Solospielzeit: 5-10 Stunden Multiplayerspielzeit: 1-10 Stunden  + Herausragende &amp; einmalige Story + Gro?artige Atmosph?re und musikalische Untermalung + Moralische Entscheidungen + Man hasst sich selbst nach dem Spiel  +/- Wiederspielwert begrenzt, nur wenn man Spa? an unz?hligen Details hat, die man erst beim zweiten Durchgang sehen und verstehen kann  - Steuerung, Deckungssystem und Begleiterverhalten haben ihre Schw?chen und T¨¹cken - Gameplay kann mit der Zeit etwas langweilig und repetitiv wirken   Fazit: Trotz mehrerer Schw?chen beim Gameplay muss man Spec Ops: The Line einfach wegen seiner Story gespielt haben. Es gibt kein vergleichbares Spiel. Unbedingt spielen!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/905450,1, New features in this year¡¯s version start with a dirt touring series that includes eight tracks (and a dirt road course). The career mode (which starts out in the new dirt series) adds the ability to be an owner/driver, allowing the player to hire staff and choose racing cars to perform research on. Online multiplayer adds tournaments, while the new Charlotte ¡°roval¡± and Phoenix redesign are included. A racing line is provided to learn each track, but only in practice mode. Also, there are nine pre-made car setups for each track that range between ¡°tight,¡± ¡°balanced,¡± and ¡°loose.¡± The short racing challenges round out the features. As in previous versions, NASCAR Heat 3 handles somewhere between an arcade game and a simulation, which strikes the balance the developers are looking for in a console-driven release. The cars are relatively easy to drive, and the AI is very aggressive and less idiotic as in last year¡¯s game. The sound design is not great (the collision effect is especially weak) and the game still lacks game options during a race (like saving progress for later or seeing what the controls are). Still, NASCAR Heat 3 is an improvement over last year, and is slowly approaching a solid arcade-sim racing game overall.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvTit1Y5E7c  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/783210,1, The single player game features historical play around the Mediterranean or randomly generated maps with good customization options but potentially unbalanced starting positions. A scenario editor and mod support are also available. The interface could be improved; specifically, the strategic overview that lists on-map objects and the political maps desperately need the ability to zoom in. Resources are collected from the map: mines, wood, and farms near cities automatically add their bounty nationwide. Cities can only produce specific units, and adding a new unit to a city¡¯s production roster requires an investment of resources (on top of the cost of actually making the unit), leading to interesting strategic decisions and less unit spam. Buildings outside of cities (such as the blacksmith, temple, and stable) can buff resource production or allow for the recruitment of advanced units. Cities, buildings, and units can also be improved to increase stats. Units fall under the typical categories of settler, infantry, cavalry, and naval forces, but more sophisticated versions can be researched. Government type and state decisions can alter your approach. Diplomacy comes with a good number of options, but there is no feedback whether some options will be accepted (and why they were not). Luckily, trade deals can be open-ended: you can request a specific resource and the partner will come back with an appropriate counter offer. Due to the time period, combat is relatively common, and the AI does a good job producing troops, attacking vulnerable units, and working well as a trade partner and ally. While Aggressors: Ancient Rome is more simplified than some other 4X games, it does not lack significant strategic decisions and its faster, combat-oriented pace is appealing.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OTJm5bmi4w  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrAPOD/recommended/403190,1,   ? A First Look At - Planetbase - video ?     POSITIVES:   I like the graphics and the feel to the game. Animations and sound works for me. I'm looking forward to actually learn the game.     NEGATIVES:    I experience the camera to be a bit stiff and limited. The built in tutorial left me with the feeling I got so much more to learn to actually be able to succeed. The speed phase of the tutorial is also very slow. It could be a lot faster. I also appreciate some good music to the games. The music here was very soft and relaxing. sometimes there was no music at all.   So, at a first look I like the game and I recommend others to try it.    ? A First Look At - Planetbase - video ?  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/601540,1, The game features a campaign on several maps with varied character customization and background options (town leader, merchant, mercenary, et cetera); the game world carries over after you die and start a new character. There is also a sandbox mode for more direct tweaking. Towns produce gold through taxation, consume food, and collect resources from nearby mines, farms, and quarries. These resources can be used to construct new buildings and raise troops. Quests can be undertaken from neutral villages, while other factions in the game can be traded with or fought. Combat involves giving orders to troops using cumbersome, non-intuitive controls that use keyboard buttons instead of interface icons. The game world is an effective setting, with other factions going about their business before you intervene. The beginning of each scenario can be slow as you wait for resources to accumulate and better units to unlock, but large battles between different factions await. Overall, Veil of Crows is very reminiscent of Mount &amp; Blade, except with RTS-style battles in place of third-person combat, and is a mostly successful pivot of that construct.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUfdBDDoNIM  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jimraynor/recommended/412460,1, Villagers ist ein klassisches Aufbauspiel, welches im Mittelalter angesiedelt ist. Obwohl es auf den ersten Blick stark an &quot;Banished&quot; erinnert, setzt es jedoch seine eigenen Schwerpunkte, indem es sich eher an Anf?nger statt an Profis richtet und den Fokus auf die Kampagne statt dem Endlosspiel legt.  Die Kampagne erz?hlt ¨¹ber 6 Missionen eine zusammenh?ngende Geschichte, die f¨¹r ein Aufbauspiel ziemlich gut gelungen ist. Sie wird zwischen den Missionen in Textform, leider ohne Sprecher, mit herausragenden, stimmungsvollen Artworks und Zeichnungen erz?hlt. Die Kampagne dient auch gleichzeitig als Tutorial und f¨¹hrt den Spieler in alle Geb?ude und Produktionsketten ein. Die Missionen haben unterschiedliche Schwerpunkte und Herausforderungen, die es jeweils zu meistern gilt. Die Kampagne ist auch der H?hepunkt des Spiels, leider jedoch bereits nach 5-6 Stunden durchgespielt. Danach kann man sich noch auf verschiedenen Karten im Endlosspiel versuchen, leider sind diese jedoch alle eher sehr klein und gr??tenteils bereits aus der Kampagne bekannt. Es gibt aber noch 2-3 neue Karten, die eigene Herausforderungen bieten und zu 1-3 weiteren Runden mit allen Geb?uden einladen. Somit ist der Umfang des Spiels mit 5-10 Stunden eher sehr gering f¨¹r ein Aufbauspiel und der Hauptkritikpunkt.  Villagers ist hierbei ein reines Aufbauspiel, aktive K?mpfe gibt es keine. Es gibt zwar seltene Zufallsereignisse, wie den Angriff von wilden Tieren oder R?ubern, die jedoch automatisch von J?gern oder Dorfwachen abgewehrt werden, wenn man entsprechende Geb?ude gebaut und Bewohner als Arbeiter zugeteilt hat. Hauptaufgabe des Spiels liegt darin, eine florierende Siedlung zu bauen und mittels verschiedener Produktionsketten alle Bewohner mit Nahrung, Trinken und Wohnraum zu versorgen. Es gibt mehrere Rohstoffe und Nahrungsmittel, die durch jeweils eigene Geb?ude/Produktionsketten gef?rdert bzw. angebaut werden k?nnen. Den Geb?uden k?nnen Arbeiter zugeordnet werden, wobei es wichtig ist eine gute Balance zwischen den verschiedenen Geb?uden und den vorhandenen Arbeitskr?ften zu finden, um die perfekte Siedlung bauen zu k?nnen. Knappe Ressourcen k?nnen von regelm??ig auftauchenden H?ndlern gekauft werden, die im Gegenzug ¨¹bersch¨¹ssige Produktion mitnehmen ¨C meist gibt es auf der Karte ein oder mehrere knappe G¨¹ter, die man per H?ndler beziehen muss.  Der Anspruch richtet sich klar an Anf?nger oder Menschen, die Abends eher noch gem¨¹tlich ohne viel Kopfzerbrechen eine Siedlung aufbauen m?chten. Das Spiel spielt sich zwar nicht von alleine und man muss durchaus ¨¹berlegt handeln, es ist jedoch bei weiterem weniger komplex und unerbittlich als Banished.  Die Grafik ist zweckm??ig, es gibt viele Aufbauspiele die deutlich sch?ner aussehen, dennoch habe ich sie nicht als schlecht empfunden und gerade bei den Details kann man trotzdem eine sehr gro?e Detailverliebtheit erkennen. Der Soundtrack und die Zeichnungen/Artworks sind jedoch ¨¹ber jeden Zweifel erhaben und bewegen sich durchg?ngig auf einem sehr hohen Niveau und untermalen das Spiel hervorragend. Einzig der deutsche Sprecher, der manche Ereignisse im Spiel ank¨¹ndigt, ist eher mittelm??ig. Technisch ist das Spiel auf einem sehr guten Niveau, es gab zwar zu Release einige Bugs, diese wurden jedoch innerhalb k¨¹rzester Zeit gefixed. Mir pers?nlich sind keine Fehler mehr beim Spielen aufgefallen, daher gibt es von technischer Seite keine Einschr?nkungen oder Vorbehalte.   Solospielzeit: 5 - 10 Stunden Multiplayerspielzeit: nicht vorhanden  + Sch?ne, interessante Kampagne + Sehr guter, stimmungsvoller Soundtrack + Liebevolle, hervorragende Zeichnungen/Artwork zwischen den Kampagnenmissionen + Hohe Detailverliebtheit  +/- Spielgrafik gewinnt zwar keine Preise, ist jedoch ausreichend +/- Komplexit?t und Schwierigkeitsgrad richten sich eher an Einsteiger, Profis k?nnten sich unterfordert f¨¹hlen  - Relativ geringe Spielzeit mangels Langzeitmotivation nach der Kampagne - Spielbare Karten alle vergleichsweise klein  Fazit: Villagers ist das perfekte Spiel f¨¹r Genreeinsteiger oder Spieler, die auch bei Aufbauspielen mehr Wert auf eine Kampagne mit konkreten Missionen als das Endlosspiel legen. Beide Gruppen d¨¹rften von Villagers nicht entt?uscht werden, wenn sie sich der eher geringen Spielzeit bewusst sind. F¨¹r Anf?nger mit einem Faible f¨¹r Kampagnen/Story in Aufbauspielen eine klare Empfehlung. F¨¹r Profis oder Spieler, die eine Herausforderung wie bei Banished suchen, d¨¹rfte Villagers zu anspruchslos und zusammen mit der eher geringen Spielzeit eine Ent?uschung sein. Diese Gruppe d¨¹rfte mit Banished besser beraten sein.

It's a sweet strategy builder game from Funatics Software.   Odin, the ruler of Asgard, is in a bad temper and trough his son and vikings out of Asgard since they lack of honor.   Your mission is to protect and help the vikings to regain their honor so they can return to Asgard.   POSITIVES:  I found the graphics very appealing (except the water line) and the viking animations are quite smooth and nice.  I like the cartoonish style and the environment looks good to my eye.  I like the music but hope it will vary a bit more since I progress trough the game.   NEGATIVES:  The game play and tutorial is confusing to me, and I don't understand exactly what I'm doing. WHat's on auto, and what's not... I think it's not to bad as soon you get the point, sort of say. I need a few hours before I get it.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Alcohol_Fueled_Brewtality/recommended/527430,-1, TL;DR - I love the idea of the game, but it left Early Access far too early. It wasn't ready then, it isn't ready now. But it is getting there albeit slowly.  Really hurts me to leave a negative review because overall I like the game, but I can't lie.  Sadly, there currently is just so much left broken and non-functioning when it comes to things like skills, perks and Heroic Deeds (which are basically achievements in-game used to unlock various things such as more perks) that the game was clearly not ready to leave Early Access just yet.  Still, the devs are constantly working on improving and fixing the game so it will most likely all get fixed in the end (they haven't abandoned the game, far from it) and once they do, I'll be the first to change my negative review to a positive one.  I just cannot with a clear conscience recommend the game, at full price, in it's current state. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Alcohol_Fueled_Brewtality/recommended/291650,1, Baldur's Gate.  Icewind Dale.  If, like me, these series of games was a huge part of your childhood/teens growing up in the earlier days of PC gaming, why then this is a wonderful game you simply cannot afford to miss out on. And if they weren't, look 'em up and see if that kind of Dungeons &amp; Dragons-esque approach to a role-playing video game might be something that appeals to you - it just might.   I must, unfortunately, voice my opinion on the price: the game is a bit on the expensive side - you definitely want both the base game and the expansion for the full experience both in terms of story and gameplay. The latter is for some unexplicable reason is split up into two purchases, each with a hefty pricetag attached. Paradox plz.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/seph_au/recommended/631510,-1, Barebones port to say the least, makes me wonder why it took so long to arrive, perhaps capcom just needed the money. DMC &quot;HD&quot; uses original low resolution ps2 movies and same gigantic UI that isn't widescreen. Textures seem to be a complete cut-copy-paste from console with no visual upgrade whatsoever. Game runs at twice normal speed if using high refresh rate monitor, need to force cap 60fps otherwise it's completely broken. Resolution capped to 1080p..  If you can overlook these issues that should have been patched prior launch and don't really care about it truly being HD which it's not. Then by all means buy, cap to 60fps and enjoy. If never played series before (what's wrong with you?) it's well worth your time. Completed games and not super keen to replay? just wait for sales. Other then finally being released on PC and running at 60fps, it's really nothing special and borderline false advertising imo.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/seph_au/recommended/680390,1,  https://youtu.be/bXIMkQAOKpo  Excellent action rpg thus far. Triple audio with decent voicework and subtitles (english/chinese/japanese), 4k/60fps. Interesting story and characters which are split between chapters that end with a boss fight. New weapons and collectables are spread throughout levels for some replay value. Killing enemies and opening hidden chests also drop orbs that are get used to upgrade skillsets. Tight controls and very approachable combo system which caters to both beginners and veterans, unfortunately controls cannot be remapped so I would suggest using a gamepad. Easy recommendation to fans of games like Strider or action platformer/metroidvania fans in general. Cheers. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/corvusblack/recommended/234650,1, This game was a suprise for me. I did not now about Shadowrun universe before, and i was kind of dumbstruck about the setting. Think DnD with cyberpunk. This alone made me buy this game, and this beauty did not disappoint me.   Combat is like the X-COM Enemy Within. Not detailed as much but still, enjoyable. The campaign is interesting (though not as much as dragonfall) and you can download more campaigns through steam workshop. There are many campaigns there and some of them are very, very good. Have I mentioned the setting is ????ing awesome?  This is an awesome game and it deserves it's pricetag. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116527414/recommended/72850,1, This is my favourite fantasy RPG, despite all of its little flaws - the freedom of movement, quest choices and role-play options is unmatched by any of its competitors as far as I know. The variety of activities as well as the depth of lore is simply inspiring. Some people wrote that the predecessor Oblivion was a better RPG - I played both, and I disagree. The good things of Oblivion are included in Skyrim, but the graphics and gameplay have been improved greatly.  I literally spent weeks of my lifetime in Skyrim with several playthroughs: I was - a Cyrodiilic vagabond who got caught by border patrol and almost executed on suspicion of treason, but miraculously saved and personally impressed by a Nord officer in the ranks of the Imperial army. I enlisted as a recruit, took part in the civil war in the province and went from a lightly armed ranger to a distinguished officer in priceless heavy plate, a one-man-army roaming the land and destroying anyone and anything that threatens the peaceful subjects of the Emperor in defiance of His laws - all while entertaining a passionate interest in Dwarven ruins and artifacts. - a Reachman from Markarth who got himself into a conflict with organised crime, had to flee from the city and learn how to survive in the wilderness, became a werewolf and follower of Hircine, the Daedric Prince of the Hunt. Hunting animals, highwaymen and soldiers of the Imperial and Thalmor occupation force proved to be the mere training phase for the real &quot;game&quot;: giants, legendary dragons and vampire lords became my prey and worthy sacrifices for my Daedric Master. - a Dark Elf from Morrowind who wandered to the ruins of Winterhold to study at the famous college there, become a master of alchemy and destruction magic, compare strength with ancient and powerful dragonpriests and collect souls for his mistress Azura. - an Argonian worker from Windhelm who had enough of discrimination and daily humiliation by the Nords, made his way to Riften and became a member of the Thieves guild, was then abducted by the Dark Brotherhood and forced into their service - which they regretted when facing their utter destruction. Yet, I felt my soul had been corrupted by the thought of gaining power exploiting others even down to their lives, and given the choice, I became a vampire and terrorized the land with my growing abilities, amassing incredible wealth.  These are only a few examples of the stories that I invented and experienced playing this game, and for giving me the material to incite my imagination in this intensity, I am grateful to Bethesda and forgive them all the bugs that occasionally occurred.  I give this game a heartfelt 9,9/10. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/corvusblack/recommended/20900,1, The first game of an awesome franchise.  Sadly, this is the game most players overlooked, mostly due to combat system. Yes it is weird, it is not practical. It is like a rhythm game to be honest. However if you bear with it at get used to the game, it shines like a diamond.   The story is mostly stand alone, not that much related to second and third games. But that doesn't mean that is should be overlooked. It is a game of politics and human nature.  Let me talk about combat system. As I have said, it is like a rhythm game. Click to attack an enemy and click again when game tells you to chain up your attacks and perform combos. Parrying is automatic, performed according to your skills. You have two swords, steel one for humans and &quot;normal&quot; beasts (such as dogs, wolves) and silver one for all kinds of monsters (vampires, necrophages, etc.). And you have three styles for each sword (strong, fast and group styles). Strong style deals heavy damage is used for slow, heavily armored opponents. Strong style also have a chance to cause bleeding that gradually decreases health, much like a poison. Fast style is used for fast enemies and have a chance to cause pain status effect which is like a stun. Group style is the situational one. It causes less damage than the other two, but critical hit chance increases as you fight 3 or more enemies. With certain skills, group style causes knockdown which makes enemies incredibly vulnerable to instant kills.  You can craft bombs, potions and blade oils by alchemy system to have an edge at the combat. There are potions that increase health regen, increase endurance regen (that is used to cast signs, more on that later), increase damage you deal at the cost of making dodge and parry impossible, etc. The downside of the potions is that all potions have a toxicity level. High toxicity level causes adverse effects, such as health damage.  Blade oils, when applied to a blade (duh), causes the blade to deal more damage, according to the oil used. You can craft oils that are effective against specific types of enemies such as vampires, spectres, necrophages and you can craft oils that are situational, causing status effects like bleeding and pain.   You can also craft bombs to help you in combat. There are various types of bombs that causes fire damage, blinding, stunning, poisoning. They are useful, but they are not absolutely necessary to beat the game.  There are also signs, spells that you can cast on the go to have and advantage on the battle. You have aard (think of force push from Star Wars) that causes stun and knockback, igni which causes damage and delivers incineration status effect to enemies, quen which forms a protective shield around you that blocks damage, axi which hexes enemies, stunning them or even converting to your side, and finally yrden which places a trap on the ground that damages enemies and delivers status effects.    Now, I beat the game on hard difficulty and here are my experiences:  -Axi and yrden signs are useless. I never used them. Quen is situational. It can give you time you need to throw a bomb or drink a potion. Mostly throughout the game you will use aard and igni.  -Blade oils are essential in hard difficulty. Be sure to have several different kinds in your inventory to cover all enemies you encounter.  -Bombs are cool, but they are not absolutely necessary.   -You'll have lots of potions to drink, but mostly you'll use swallow (health regen), tawny owl (endurance regen)  and cat (see in darkness - you'll encounter many caves/crypts). Be warned that swallow is not a regular health potion, it just increases the regeneration rate so it can be useless against enemies that deal lots of damage in short time. If you want instant health, you'll need white raffard's decoction, but take care drinking it because it is highly toxic.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116527414/recommended/364470,1, Legends is the new free-to-play collectible card game in the Fantasy universe of The Elder Scrolls by Zenimax/Bethesda, produced by the experienced strategy card game developer Dire Wolf Digital.   Gameplay  Instead of explaining the rules systematically in their entirety, which you can read about elsewhere, I will point out some differences to the model archetype of the genre, Magic: The Gathering, which I used to play both with real cards and online in the past.   In general, deck building and duels are the major aspects of the game in both cases. Also, both ESL and MTG Online offer the alternatives of casual and tournament battles against real players or a competent AI. However, ESL adds stories that form the framework of series of AI battles, one of which comes with the base game and one (?Dark Brotherhood¡°) can be obtained with real or ingame currency. I did not find the stories incredibly interesting, they give you good bonus cards though. Additionally, you can choose a profile picture from a lore-friendly selection, connected with a certain voice and way to express yourself during a battle. You receive rewards and card upgrades from ?levelling up¡° by collecting game experience, and your chosen race determines what kinds of creatures you are likely to receive this way - a nice touch for all those RPG fans who flock to ESL coming from Skyrim or The Elder Scrolls Online. So far, ESL offers slightly more than the genre dinosaur.   With regard to deck building, I have to mention that in ESL, there is no free card market like in MTGO, where I spent quite some time and real money to get the rare cards I needed for a competitive deck, and that was full of ugly bots as well. Instead, you can break down cards to receive gems, that can be used to buy cards, a simple and clean process and the reason why it is to be labelled as a collectible card game rather than a trading card game.  The developers of ESL also prevented abuse and spam by replacing the formerly common free ingame chat (as you can use in MTGO) with a selection of eight verbal expressions, like ?Hello¡° or ?Good game¡°, which are voice acted according to your chosen profile character (see above). Even though this is somehow restrictive, I think it is an intelligent solution to a common problem in all multiplayer games. I found these ?verbal emoticons¡° to be quite sufficient to have basic and polite human interaction. You can still invite your friends from real life or from Steam if they tell you their Bethesda account name in order to play with them, which of course means you can use other chat channels for a nice conversation while you play ESL in a small window.  The most welcome feature in ESL that makes it impossible for me to enjoy MTGO ever again is the rune mechanic: As you lose health, ?runes¡° are broken one after the other, which lets you draw additional cards and in some cases (?prophecies¡°) even play them instantly and without spending magicka. This creates a balancing effect to the benefit of a losing player and makes the game dynamic more interesting. It also makes the attacker think twice before dealing minor damage to his opponent that just might give him a tactical option that could turn the game in his favour.  In ESL, the ?battlefield¡° is limited in space, usually to eight creatures in total. In MTG, there is no such restriction, and more than once, I have been beaten by insane combos giving the opponent opportunity to summon infinite numbers of weak creatures who then overwhelmed my forces, which I did not enjoy. In fact, I quit MTG because of such auto-win combo decks, which made the whole game kind of pointless: Either they got it and won instantly, or they did not and lost, my own efforts did not really matter; not so here.  The magical resource that lets you summon troops and perform other actions is obtained in completely different ways. In MTG, you have to play land cards that give you mana every turn. This necessity means that approximately half your deck consists of land cards, most of which are quite bland and boring. In ESL, magicka is gained every turn without such lands, and your magicka pool is increased automatically. This has two effects: One, deck building is more interesting without such bland basic cards. Two, the battle escalates more dynamically, you cannot get stuck with good cards, but no resource to use them because you had bad luck with the distribution of land cards.  You have almost complete freedom in how to build your deck, however, focussing on a certain race of Tamriel has advantages, as you can gain buffs specific cards can give each other. Each race implicates its own playstyle: Imperials rely on collective buffs and numbers, Redguards mostly benefit from weapon and armor item cards, Argonians increase their magicka pool more quickly... Those playstyles and the free combinations of tactical choices guarantee a good variety of gameplay.   Until now, I have not become bored with regard to the outcome of the duels either. Even after making a lot of efforts to optimize my deck, I win three out of five games in average. Either the different common deck builds are that well balanced, or the player matchmaking process has been improved since the early reviews that complained about this aspect.    Presentation  The graphics and the voice acting are of the same high quality as TES V. They even reused some of the voice actors (e.g. General Tullius' voice for the card ?Scouting Patrol¡°; the voice for the card ?General Tullius¡° proper is female, which slightly confused me until I remembered Legate Rikke who might give orders in the general's name ¨C just one example of how true this game is to the Elder Scrolls lore).  As you would expect, graphical and sound effects are designed to make you become addicted to the game. That's OK with me, as I am a gaming addict anyway, and it is done competently.  The stories are told in largely static images, which is not what I would wish for, but I understand that a free-to-play product can only use a limited budget for such a secondary part of the game.    Value for money  The game is completely free. You can use real money to buy card packs and a storyline expansion, but even that is not necessary. You get random cards from winning duels, which you can exchange for those you need at a rate between 10:1 (common cards) and 4:1 (legendary cards), and the Dark Brotherhood story can be bought with ingame gold ¨C which I achieved within three weeks of casual activity. I have not spent a dime on ESL, and I got a lot of fun out of it.   Verdict  This game is a very nice addition to this legendary franchise. Building my Imperial deck inspired me to play Skyrim's Civil War questline once again. Apart from that, it can hold its head high among competitors of the same genre. According to my bias in favour of the Elder Scrolls universe, I call it an 8/10.     EDIT: Pay to win?  With &quot;Heroes of Skyrim&quot; out, rumours have spread that ESL would be pay-to-win now, which is complete nonsense:  1. Those cards were distributed for free on expansion release, a 50 cards pack for everyone and then, for a whole week, you could get HoS cards for free via daily quests, 18 per day. You didn't have to pay, you didn't even have to win, just attack opponents 30 times over an unlimited number of duels. Basically, HoS was given away. 2. If you got into the game later, you can still buy HoS packs with ingame gold, and single cards with regular gems, without any money involved. If you want to use dragons and shouts, just - get them and play. 3. HoS is not as overpowered as some sore losers want to make it seem. You can beat those decks with pre-expansion builds if your synergies are optimized. I do not see a p2w situation at this point.  The game continues to be fun for a completely free account such as mine, therefore the update does not change my rating. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/_monstertm/recommended/405710,1, --Patch 1.1.37 Review-- Reminder, game is in alpha, and it would be stupid to point out the buggy glitchy parts of the game, but i wont shy away from things that is needed in the game.  To Simplify what this game is, Harvestmoon+Minecraft. It is really rare to find a farming game like this with a quest chain and an actualy progression you must follow. Most farming games is, your grandfather died, you got a new farm, boom, npcs leave you alone. But in this, you gotta talk to this person, and build X item, deliver a package the X npc, ect ect.   One thing i am extremely impressed about a ALPHA GAME! is that they already have VERY cute and VERY amazing events! prime exemple! during autumn, theres a haloween event in town, everyone is dressed up, you get new quests, and theres a SPOOooooOOooookyyyYyyy maze! 10/10 for such cuteness &lt;3  Farming is EZ to learn, fishing is extremely simple, honestly, the hardest part about the game, is learning how to build things, and construct buildings, for certain buildings, you need X amount of X items to be considered whatever building yur makin.   One thing i really dislike at the moment, is that you can destroy anything in the village, which is just a very cheap way of making alot of cash, i dont think players should be allowed to do that, there should be a anti greif zone around the village, just like spawn points on minecraft servers.    this is all i gotta say about this amazing alpha game so far, if you wana join the hype train! COME ALONG! :D  9/10! eNjoy! =^-^=

https://steamcommunity.com/id/_monstertm/recommended/268500,1, Twas a pree fun game while it lasted. But, if i must be perfectly honest, the first XCOM was much better., and ill point out why.  In the 1rst game, the aliens invade the planet, and they have aliens dressed as humans, and there scouting and gathering information. In the 2nd game... somehow the humans are &quot;semi&quot; co-existing togheter, the aliens supply the police force known as ADVENT. For me,  XCOM 2 has a much weaker story, and way of a dire importance to missions you do. In the first XCOM, right off the bat, you get to pick which country you play, which gives you a specific perk through-out the entire game,  you get to slowly but surely gear up your weak soldiers, and you really felt there was a progression when you finaly beat a mission that would unlock various alien technologies that you would need for future combat. In XCOM2, altho fun, did not captivate me as much as the 1rst one. The researches were boring, weapons were mundane, and whenever i would research and get something &quot;amazing&quot; as they would make it to be, like a armor that makes you run through wall, i was already 3/4 done with the game, and i didnt really care about all the fancy new gadgets XCOM2 has over the 1rst game.

Well this is a single flash video &amp; foreign language UI with about $1000000 worth of in-app purchases, along with day1 dlc that costs more then the game.  Let's check the description. &quot;1.200 more than FULL HD! FULL HD! FULL HD! Videos, it's very important, i say three times.&quot; is an outright lie. One video is stored locally and a couple of 10second clips stream online from god knows where.  &quot;in addition to video, there are more than 100 photoes, which is also HD.&quot; Potatoes or photos? Another lie. Pay for them. &quot;Dress up the ¡°girlfriends¡± - dress up your girlfriends with the outfits of your choice, and develop your relationships to your liking&quot; Single outfit available, pay the rest, almost nothing unlockable from gameplay. &quot;It is a must-have training program for dating and picking up girls in real life. &quot; The world is clearly doomed.  tl:DR Foreign language UI with close to no content, you pay through the nose for everything. Please do yourself a favor and just google asian porn instead. Much cheaper option and you would see more bobs.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Puuhattu/recommended/544920,1, The whole concept of the game is pretty nice, but the show-dictators who team with players and create an unfair environment is really ruining everything. Maybe the solution would be not that godlike powers for directors, so the games can be fair more often than one out of ten matches.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/_monstertm/recommended/351910,1, If i could compare this game to another game... It would have to be the older Settlers games. Except instead of controling romans. You control Vikings, Already, thats a much cooler type of people to play with . Do keep in mind that it is still beta. So some glitches, and other unfinished things are needed. But besides that, the game is uber fun. each viking requires sleep and food, and thats the only needs they desire. and technicly they can provide both of those by themselves by sleeping under a tree, or picking berries from a bush.  The story goes that Odin is angry at the Vikings for some reason, so when vikings die, they don't &quot;really&quot; die, they go in some sort of purgatory viking world, where if you die, you just get swooshed to a island, and you must fight for your honor. How does a viking get into valhalla? Easy, so building and killing grants honor points, and each viking how there own seperate bar of honor. when they reach 10000 honor points, they ascend into valhalla.  Heres the pretty good part, when a single viking performs a task that would grant honor points, all other active vikings also get the honor points. So its really a group effort situation.  In resume. beautiful graphics,  AI i would say is 80% smart, you get to build beautiful viking villages, and the game technicly has unlimited gameplay, since every time you beat a map, a randomly generated map will be created for your next level, and they do indeed get harder and harder.  so far so good  8/10  eNjoy ^-^ 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/_monstertm/recommended/262060,1, This game IS the darkest dungeon game iv ever played. Your Heroes will die... You name your heroes a friend's name, you will be sad when they die. What's that? You see a carcase and want to collect its meat? BOOM! syphilis!  Never once have i EVER seen a game like this. Moral of your party is crucial, there hunger and light level is just as important,  and if you expect to get a healer in every party you make, guese again, because it's rare, and its not only about the heals, its about damage output and stunning your enemies and knowing there weekness such as blight/bleed/stun.  Nowhere near finished the game, but iv played quite alot to know most of it, and give my honest rating.  With the estimated 100+ hours of gameplay, and the intense fight for your life situation. i would give this game...  10/10! YUP! eNjoy ^-^

https://steamcommunity.com/id/gecimen/recommended/222730,1, This is a little god game where you gain/unlock different abilities both by achieving things within the current playthrough or overall all playthroughs. You create different types of terrain and putting stuff (plants, mines, animals) on each terrain produces a different result. People come and settle on your world and they prosper according to the resources you supply them. While there are quite some stuff to do, it doesn't offer a super long experience, and honestly it doesn't need to. If you like god games, definitely give this a chance.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/gecimen/recommended/435400,1, I've played plenty of hidden object games and none were as fun or intelligent as Hidden Folks. First off, this game makes a lot more sense than the ones with fancy artwork that ask you to find tons of irrelevant items. Secondly you have clues from the start, the difficulty is the fact that majority of the images are giant. This also prevents you to find objects by clicking everywhere blindly. Thirdly, to find some people or objects in the game you have to solve little puzzles that are integrated within the image, and not some irrelevant puzzle game.  On top of all these, the artwork and sounds are super cute. Definitely buy this. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Burn86/recommended/435150,1, This masterpiece has such a wide scope and is such a dense, feature-rich game that it's easy to lose track of time and get completely immersed in its writing, characters, and raw inventiveness. There's a never-ending draw to see one more quest to completion, to try out one new ability or tactic in one more encounter, or to explore just one more location. This game will relentlessly test your own creativity, demand your attention, prove your abilities, force you to question your own decisions, and overall keep giving reasons to continue playing and never lets go. This is one of the best RPG games!  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1183002987   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1159875795   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1376052388  Unlocked all achievements! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Burn86/recommended/639170,1, I think in a weird way this interactive movie-game was Telltale's most original production (this and Season One). Because, although it's based on existing franchise (as per usual for TellTale) its story and characters are completely independent from the original source and are not chained to any existing narrative. Walking Dead, Wolf Among Us, Borderland, Game of Thrones, Guardians of the Galaxy, Batman - all these franchises that TellTale used we expected something from the story or characters, but not from Minecraft. The only thing that chains this game to the franchise is the surrounding world, but the characters, story and adventures are all TellTale.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1531787750   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1466594728  Unlocked all achievements!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Burn86/recommended/22320,1, The game is dated, but features some elements that Oblivion lacks. And while Oblivion gives a few of those moral choices quests, Morrowind really features them like you'd expect. The world feels so real and authentic with some of the patches and mods available, the game can look more like you'd hope for this day and age. It ranks right up there with recent classics such as Baldur's Gate, Fallout, and Planescape: Torment in terms of sheer enjoyment, and is a game every role-playing fan needs to own.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1427033362   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1427087360

I've played all the other Heroes games, and I'm still undecided whether I like Heroes 3 or 4 better. That being said, Heroes 5 is a lot like 3, with virtually the same gameplay and mechanics, and very little new material.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/_monstertm/recommended/407330,1, Been playing for a good 6 hours, and all i could say is that im quite impressed. If all sakura games were actual games like this , not specificly a dungeon crawling game, but just any other type of game. The action is pree legit, and and character models are the same &quot;type&quot; as previous sakura games. Only complain i have so far is that during combat, the options like escape,  use items, switch party members are not on the main screen, and there is no button to change from combat action to secondary actions like most rpg games does, instead you gotta go in ESC and do it, just very odd.  You can go around capturing various girls, who can help you for your combat, do not worry if you cant play them all, since they all gain experience and level up just the same as your front 3 characters. No weapons, no armors, just weapons and skins, so it isnt complicated.  Out of all the sakura games, this is one that you should buy.   Giving it a 8/10    eNjoY =^-^=

That may sound boring, but HO HO HO, trust me it isnt, i havnt played a intense &quot;city&quot; building game like this in quite a while. You got to manage your resources sparingly, because the game will not give you pity from the meteor strikes.. the sand storms... and the solar flare that will kill anyway who dares to go outside, because ya know... radiation is a B****.

You can research, upgrade, craft, train, anc coordinate all of your crew members! Some things in this game is silly, for exemple. a Unicorn Rainbow Planet , or a laser pointer gun that dosnt fire itself, but several dozen cats jump on your enemy!

It combines brick buster with a bubble shooter, which turned out to be a great idea. There are tons of stuff to unlock throughout the game, some of which are super fun. It's 2018 and somebody can still make a novel brick buster. Must buy at this price.  Note: Don't judge the game until you unlock the last upgrades of each persona. You will be amazed.

As the fourth entry into the Elder Scrolls series, it certainly improves over Morrowind in almost every way. It's easy to spend hundreds of hours into the game and even more with mods. The lore and quest are all interesting and unique especially the Shivering Isles DLC.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1427059464   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1432224959

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Burn86/recommended/234140,1, A very good game set in a post-apocalyptic world, with some excellent bits but also some issues. The setting is great, there's a good sense of freedom and the main missions are pretty good, but the story is quite flat (though the last mission is surprisingly great and lots of fun), the fighting system is nothing more than decent, but the end game becomes repetitive. Just like Shadow of Mordor has its special thing (the Nemesis system), Mad Max's special thing is the car combat which is great fun and very satisfying. A must-play for Mad Max and post-apocalyptic genre fans!  P.S. This game (and other Warner Bros. open world games) has the best screenshot system. Just pause the game whenever you like and free roam with the camera to take cool pictures from any angle.   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1543289157   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=831640607   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1562306736  Unlocked all achievements!

Every time you die and have to restart the game gives you different experience.  The world is literally huge and survivability gets harder every stage!  Props to game developers!  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Shad3less/recommended/7510,1, The game generally had a very short storyline, but I would still recommend this to everyone. It has a very fast paced combat system. Never had any troubleshooting or crash issues with the game! Story could have been a bit more complex and longer, but still it's a very enjoyable game. Although some combos are very hard to use with keyboard and mouse so I would recommend using xbox controller if you have one lying around.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Shad3less/recommended/732430,1, Okay so honestly.   This is a serious bang for the buck. So it is cheap, but not only that!  It is super fun and addictive. The controls in this game are great. You would expect it to have its flaws, but nope. You can compete with other player scores, so you can play this for competetive reasons also.  I have not yet seen many bugs. Only one where you spawn right inside a wall.  It's a great title regardless and has a lot of potential as a game idea. Can't wait to see where they might take this idea.  I would recommend this solid game to anyone! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Shad3less/recommended/644930,1, I don't write enough reviews!  But since I've played the game for roughly 360 hours now I'd say it's fair to give a positive review towards early access.  So here are all the pros and what I find fantastic and great about this title.  - Great and fun zombie killing gameplay experience on all difficulties - Game offers good challenges! - Little to no bugs or issues that would destroy your gameplay experience. - 4 very different maps to play on that are also randomly generated, so gameplay does not get boring or repetetive. - Community challenges that let you compete with other people scores - Extremely addictive as it does not get repetetive as quickly. - Great music, unit, effect sounds - Well polish UI and easy learning curve.  Here are some cons that need work on, but they are not awful!  - Units can be cumbersome to use as they don't follow the orders you give them time by time - No control over towers in general. They pick units to shoot by random. You get just a little control by giving &quot;priority&quot;, but that's about it. - Lack of different game modes - Lack of unit variety  Okay so all in all this game is well worth every penny you spend. I would say be careful as it can consume your time without a notice.  As this is an early access game, I'd say it has been very well polish and absolutely fantastic title!   For everyone who loves games such as starcraft, Age of Empire or warcraft 3? You'll love this one.  And I would 200% recommend this game to anyone.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/xzibitusak/recommended/748970,-1, This game is truly a wonderful masterpiece. But there's also a huge problem deep inside. A couple of levels do have multiple solutions. But each level has only one scripted win move. Therefore the other ones are taken as a failure. I will change my review once they fix this issue. It's annoying to deal with this kind of problems. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/xzibitusak/recommended/361280,1, It's one of those strategic management games. If you like those games, you will enjoy this too. I would recommend buying this game on sale. Addictive gameplay makes this game worth it. It's basically a very simple oil drilling simulator. The atmosphere is great and the concept too.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/xzibitusak/recommended/866420,1, This game is now finally a part of my library. Oleksandr Savostianov did a really good job. It just brings me back to my childhood years. I have to recommend it for the nostalgia sake. It's been such a long time since I last played it.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/xzibitusak/recommended/874370,1, It's a great game, but it's overpriced. I would recommend buying it on sale. The whole game is just one hour long. Other than that, it's just a great game. The atmosphere is awesome, try it out. I have nothing negative to say about it. Anate studio makes really good games. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/xzibitusak/recommended/742170,1, This game can be described really easily. Doctor is gay and he want's a boyfriend. So he builds himself a beautiful monster. This sounds like a necrophilia love story. I mostly enjoyed the game and it's free. You can try it out, if you like yaoi stuff.

She has some issues with your relationship. Therefore, you have to make it work again. If you fail this quest, you will lose your love. It's around one hour long and it's beautiful. I just really have to recommend this game.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Erquint/recommended/264710,1, No time for a full review but here's one for my repeated nomination of this game as GOTY, since it came out of Early Access.  I'll start off by saying that this is the worthiest adaptation of Robinson Crusoe spirit in gaming by date and I expect this honor to last a long time since now still. There's a lot of specific praise I could give this game but most of it would spoil the discovery for a new player.  And discovery is key with this game, as it grabs you by the gills (accidental pun aknowledged) and draws you in very soon after you start exploring its world, even though right until the point I tried it ¡ª the game looked like a completely unassuming time-waster to me. It undersells itself a lot in the marketing materials and LPs and there are reasons to that. It really requires one to play it to understand its appeal. Rarely I encounter such a phenomenon and I've played countless games of all ilks.  This game is solidly in the top list of games I ever played in my entire life. I will always remember it as a masterpiece both in its own right and as an indie, as well as a definition of a hidden gem.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/jigsawjason/recommended/349580,1, Yet another early access game. A game on the Eclipse Engine, and published by Free Reign Entertainment. Those 3 things shouldn't deter you you from buying though. Minicharge of Nacho Games has a proven track record in decent quality games such as Hawken. Even solo queuing is enjoyable, but a lot more fun in a party. The lead dev is pretty active with the community and interacts in his stream. Seems pretty transparent when asked questions about the game. It's worth a shot if you like tactical team based gameplay. Main thing I do have an issue is it's only one round. Should maybe be a best of 7 at least. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jigsawjason/recommended/353640,1, I lost countless hours in this game. Start playing and before you know it hours have passed while trying for all the stars. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jigsawjason/recommended/392690,1, You get to be a dog that somehow triggered a time machine and has to solve puzzles to get back to the right year. Puzzles range from turning water on to get a guard away from a door to finding a bomb to blow up a pile of rocks. It's a lot of finding objects to help you get to other objects. Has some serious potential imo. It's on Unity so it will run on pretty much any rig. Right now it is the 1984 level, but Medieval Ages and other levels are in development. Definitely worth keeping an eye on or grabbing if you like puzzle games and/or just want to be a dog time travelling.     Cops and crowbars don't mix well btw :)     Here is some gameplay:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8G9jciM_sE

https://steamcommunity.com/id/jigsawjason/recommended/435530,1, Amazing story. Interesting characters every step along the way. Great environments to explore. You rescue people along the way and need to make sure you have food and med kits to keep alive along your journey to all kinds of towns to deliver miscellaneous items. Never know what is going to be on the other side of each door. Need to know when to fight and when to run. Mistakes are not forgiven. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jigsawjason/recommended/427250,1, If you are a fan of the classic RTS games like C&amp;C Red Alert, Warcraft 2, etc this is for you. Easy to learn and hard to master. I haven't gotten around to multiplayer or co-op yet, but so far the main campaign is great. Steadily readies you for later battles as it introduces new units and buildings each mission.   It has your standard destroy all enemy buildings and survive x amount of minutes. Each mission has 3 difficulties that add harder objectives along with harder enemies. So there is plenty to do in single player to get familiar with the game before jumping headfirst into multiplayer.  I definitely recommend this to casual and hardcore RTS fans.  If you want to see how to lose your army fast watch this video.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9QmIBV_bVY

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020998869/recommended/704450,1, This used to be the milestone of DnD games. Everyone should take a look at it with this Enhanced Edition The price is worth it i gues.. ofc if you want it cheaper you can buy the standard diamond edition for probably less than half of it yet the enhanced has easier multiplayer, buggfixes, compability fixes aswell as a more stable build. Not that many features got added, its backwards compatible with old savegames and mods though so there is a??????ton of adventure modules for those that dont like the wonderful story of Neverwinter or already know it all  You cant play MP with the older versions due to version and added content So you either play Diamond edition or Enhanced. If all friends still play diamond it might be worth still playing diamond. New players will likely grab the enhanced edition over the diamond. The danger of splitting a community sadly exists with this - but once the enhanced edition is fully completed some ppl might mod Diamond to a way they can play together on mp as they were able to in the betabuilds  (and besides i think every loyal fan that played this for ages can drop 20$ once in a while on a remake like this)  There could be more features added.. yet they are still working on it  7/10 for the enhance (its okay but there still can be done a lot more and there will be a lot more) 10/10 for the game overall

https://steamcommunity.com/id/RonzioPilato/recommended/359550,1, Simpatico, eccentrico, accattivante. Sono queste le parole che possono definire al meglio Rainbow Six Siege? Forse. Strategico, cardiopalma, chi usa gli schudi in difesa ¨¨ fesso, coordinazione, comunicazioni, apri il muro, apri la botola, prendi Bandit, pensare sopra le righe. Potrebbe essere questa una descrizione pi¨´ accurata per questo titolo tripla A? Nemmeno per sogno. Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six? Siege narra la storia di una ragazza nata a Gerusalemme, la citt¨¤ dei falsi dei. Il suo nome ¨¨ Eliza, e ben presto prender¨¤ la fama di &quot;colei che non sta ad ascoltare le vecchie&quot;. Di poche parole ma di molti fatti, Eliza inizia subito con la persecuzione, ovviamente dalla parte giusta, e grazie a questo pesantissimo allenamento quotidiano, Eliza sviluppa una velocit¨¤ impressionante, quasi disumana. Non sembra pi¨´ un caso che sia nata e cresciuta in una citt¨¤ a cos¨¬ stretto contatto con gli dei. Purtroppo, verso la sua maggiore et¨¤, le cose alla divin citt¨¤? si capovolgono ed Eliza si vede la protagonista delle perseguzioni. Con la citt¨¤ ormai in fiamme e distrutta dalle lotte intestine, Eliza si unisce ad un gruppo di Alchimisti? i quali lavorano assiduamente alla ricerca e sviluppo non di una nuova ala anteriore o di rivisitare le pance, ma di trovare un modo per non farsi pi¨´ colpire dai sassi e lance dei perseguitatori. Dopo mesi intensi di ricerca, un Alchimista, proveniente dalle terre sovietiche, Shuhrat, trova la gemma perfetta, in grado di rendere immune ai compi alla testa chiunque la beva. Ma, ahim¨¨, chi la berr¨¤ dovr¨¤ pagare un prezzo assai caro. Eliza senza dubbio alcuno si propone come cavia e si reca subito al laboratorio degli Alchimisti?, trangugia la gemma e ne assorbe in men che non si dica i poteri. Una leggenda ¨¨ nata, la leggenda ¨¨ nata. Ash, la ragazza pi¨´ potente di tutte, veloce, inarrestabile, penetrante, ma soprattutto, intoccabile. Con la fama di &quot;due secondi e sono gi¨¤ al bioriskio&quot; e &quot; tre per otto sto gi¨¤ piazzando il disinnescatore Blitz muovitiiiiiii&quot;, scala tutte le classifiche delle Hit Parade? e si ritrova in cima alla lista della FBI, ma non come perseguitata, come accadeva a Gerusalemme, ma come miglior urlatrice di &quot;Watch for the blast!&quot;. Purtroppo, quando sei in cima all'Olimpo, cos¨¬ in alto da poter quasi toccare gli dei con un dito, ¨¨ inevitabile avere dei nemici. La pi¨´ spietata di loro ¨¨ Elena. Gallo vi starete chiedendo. Purtroppo no, ¨¨ la pi¨´ ben spietata Elena Maria, detta anche &quot;il riflesso che non infessa ma hai visto ha 40 anni per¨° che bona&quot;. Questo e ben altro vi aspetta in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six? Siege , aggiungetelo immediatamente alle vostre librerie per scoprire il resto di questa avvincente storia, fatta di semi dei quasi intoccabili, spaventi, angeli, Adamo ed Eva, robottoni giganti, trappole e l'immancabile C4 di quel pelatazzo di Jack piazzato sempre sotto le finestre. Qual ¨¨ il prezzo da pagare per poter ricevere i poteri della gemma vi starete chiedendo? Acquistate il gioco e lo scoprirete molto avanti...

I've only played in the company. I no longer have the strength to play mp) What can I say about this game? Everything ... is very bad) 1. Optimization. It's probably the most important thing in this game. It is disgusting. Game loves to brake in the most unsuitable moments. 2. Bots. I've never been seing the most useless bots for all my gamers live. They do not cover and also do not cause much damage. Thank God they are immortal. And, yes, they still like to stand in your way (especially when you're running from Alien), and they like to stand right in front of the your gun when you're shooting exploding shells. 3. AI. I can only say that the AI ??immediately pounced on a player as soon as they see him. Apparently, they haven't an interest in bots. Of course, sometimes they are attacking them but only to get closer to the player to attack him. If you think that the all 100 aliens or 100 soldiers, who in front of you will be distracted by bots - you're likely to make a mistake and your body will be broken into small pieces from the claws or grenades. 4. Grenades. If the AI ??throw grenades at you - just die. You do not have time to run away if you do not notice how he did it. The grenade will explode instantly and tear you to pieces (I'd played on the highest difficulty, so I don't know will you have a time to run on an easier levels or won't) 5. Aliens. What a stupid Aleins here! No comments. 6. People. Most of all in this game, I was afraid of meeting people. At maximum difficulty they almost oneshot you. Balance? No, have not heard. 7. Probably many of you know about the game Dark Souls. And about the fact that it is quite hardcore. But everything is very thought out, and the hardcore is really can be passed. Hardcore in this game only gets more. It is incongruously. Absolutely.  After all this, I want to say that if you are a huge fan of this universe - buy, go through and delete. If you're not a fan, but want to play in this game - download it. The game is not worth the money.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/lforward/recommended/469600,1, I waited over 3 years for this game, now it finally released. There's a lot of negative reviews right now because the servers were not able to handle the amount of players that tried logging in yesterday. Today it works much better already and the team is doing everything to cure the server issues. So again, don't listen too much to all the negative reviews, the game definitely deserves attention.   This game is perfect for you if you loved playing custom games, especially TDs in Warcraft 3. It is also perfect for you if you want to play a new genre with your friends, there has never been a competitive Tower Defense ever, finally this genre got the credit it deserves. Honestly if you browse this review you should either give it a try or watch some content and see if you like it, the game is faster than the Warcraft 3-Mod but it is still very chilled, it's the perfect game for a lan-party.  The game in it's current state features 4 legions + mastermind, matchmaking, bot games, custom lobbies, so you could even play 4v4 in-house and a lot of passion of the developers.  In the future there will be more legions, more features, more content, cosmetics purchasable with ingame currency and modding support via custom games.   Honestly I played this game only 350 hours to the current point but I know that thousands of hours will follow.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/CenturioXVII/recommended/302510,1, This game is Batman Arkham Origins with Rome style. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/DSBLucifer/recommended/582010,1, Hey  ich kann sagen, dass ich dieses Spiel liebe! Ich habe schon damals 2009 Monster Hunter TRI gespielt und dort hatte ich mehr als 10000 H auf meinen Char! Die PSP Spiele sind auch nicht zu kurz gekommen au?er bei den Nintendogames musste ich leider aussetzen! Und ich hoffe ich kann jetzt mal Behaupten ich kenn mich in dem Game bisschen aus^^  Das Spiel ansich ist echt gut erkl?rt. Man kommt schnell rein! Die Maus &amp; Tastatur Umsetztung ist gut gelungen und dank der zahlreichen Umstellungen die man im Spiel machen kann sollte jeder schnell auf seinen pers?hnlichen Lieblingsbind kommen.  Bei meinem PC gab es bis jetzt keine Probleme mit Frame-Einbr¨¹chen! Specs: Intel i5-4460 3.20GHz            8 GB RAM und Geforce GTX 960 4 GB RAM  Bis jetzt hab ich einfach nichts weiter am Spiel auszusetzten au?er, dass es f¨¹r mich zu wenig Content! Es fehlen f¨¹r mich zum Beispiel: Wassermaps/Unterwasserk?mpfe und viele Wassermonster  und allgemein h?tten sie viel mehr Monster einf¨¹gen k?nnen/m¨¹ssen da sie ja nun keine Speicherbegrenzung mehr haben wie auf PSP oder Nintendo!  Aber vielleicht liege ich da auch falsch! Berichtigt mich dann bitte!  Also von mir aus ist es eine KLARE Kaufempfehlung !!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/DSBLucifer/recommended/469600,1, Nun nach mehr als fast einer Woche nach Ver?ffentlichung, muss ich sagen es ist spielbar! Gameplay technisch noch nicht richtig ausgereift aber daf¨¹r ist es ja auch noch ein Early Access. Leider bin ich immer noch ein bisschen entt?uscht von dem Schwierigen Start...... Aber jetzt geht es klar  8/10 Punkten! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/lord_bold/recommended/204360,1, Well, this is ????ing amazing. Very cool graphics and very nice mechanics for a 2d fight game. And the coop mode is beyond perfect.  10/10 would deus vult again 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/lord_bold/recommended/440,1, When searching for games to play, thinking about the storyline, the context, is something very useful, as it normally identifies which games a worth playing or not. Downloading pirate content, just to test if the game is worth it, it's a very nice way of trying it (if you later buy the game, I don't want to support cracking). But when this comes to tf2, you get wasted. It's f2p. I mean,   you just don't have to find   the crack to try the game, you can just download it and play. And when it comes to the storyline, it's a complete madness. It's everything but serius. And it's funny. A damn lot funny. The game is fairly old, and it is something out of the ordinary. It can be barely described by words. Every single situation is unique, and is very unlikely to happen again. When it comes to graphics, it's masterful comic appearance just makes it much more fresh than what it really is. I have to admit that I am a very &quot;scroogie&quot; person when buying videogames, and tf2 it's the first game I bought in steam so far. Astonishing. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/lord_bold/recommended/400,1, A unique game, with unique strategies and puzzles. With a first person look, you control a girl who is able to create portals with a futuristic gun, and you have to struggle through diferent rooms with obstacles, while being watched by the creepy but friendly A.I. GlaDOS. Even the sentry guns in this game are cute. If you haven't played it, you don't know what you are missing. Get it on the sales, and it will only cost you a couple of euros. Totally worth it.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/lord_bold/recommended/599390,1, This game is one of the best free games I have ever played in my life. It can be played on an inmense amount of devices (I first played it on a Raspberry Pi) and offers simple-looking, yet very strategic gameplay, easy to play and incredibly hard to master. The lore included is very interesting aswell, the possibilities are endless. You can play as almost every fantasy faction.  But the truth is that the best of this game is its AWESOME community. You will find a sheer amount of extra goodies online, as the game is open source, and you might even add some content yourself. Your very own grain of sand of this great, great game.  What are you waiting for?

https://steamcommunity.com/id/lord_bold/recommended/221380,1, Although it may seem I've only played this game a few hours, I've been playing since I was 7 years-old or so. I have countless hours on it, and I can proudly say it's my favourite game EVER. With the new expansions, the FE team has kept the game alive and fresh, when other have decayed, taking it to a new level, with up to 9 new civs and huge new chunks of strategies with all the DLC's. It would be crazy to say this game isn't GREAT. 11/10 would command again any civ ever. Get it as fast as you can. Congrats to the FE team for it's commitment with this legendary game.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/aceskipper1/recommended/236850,-1, I'm finally getting round to my review for Europa Universalis IV (EU4). Many may be suprised to see that I am not, in-fact, recommending this game. No doubt this review will receive criticism, I can completely understand why. This game is dearly beloved by the Paradox community and is, without a doubt, the most played and most popular game of the franchise. The brutal, unavoidable truth is that, despite the things I am going to say in this review, if you haven't purchased this game and are contemplating it, you will probably enjoy it. The game does a lot right, specifically the way that it juggles war and diplomacy, and I would make the argument that EU4 is the epitome of grand strategy gaming. However, this review is not a pandering of the mass opinion. Rather, I am going to attempt to explain how I see the game in the hope that anyone like myself doesn't waste their money on something they will come to dislike.  EU4 does little wrong as a standalone game. It does what it says on the tin and it does it well. The issue comes with the wider picture. If this is your first venture into grand strategy games of any kind, especially Paradox grand strategy games, then purchase EU4. It is sweet and simple. To more experienced strategy gamers, on the contrary, EU4 sees its first onion right here.  The game is too easy.  Not that its so easy that you could achieve world domination on your first playthrough, mind you. Rather, what I mean by describing it as too easy is that the game is too simple - there isn't enough to do - and all of the difficulties are uncontrollable random events. Other games - its strategy brethen in particular - don't have this issue. Whilst random events do occasionally come in to shake things up, the emphasis is on the strategy, the methods you employ to improve your scenario and the risk factors involved in making these decisions. Other strategy games tend to work like an echo chamber. Crusader Kings 2 (full review on my profile), another Paradox grand strategy game, is a perfect example of this. When a random event occurs that hinders you - or when you employ a risky strategy that fails - you could lose everything. Your kingdom could collapse, you could go into serious debt and you might even be killed, whittling your dynasty down to the imbecilic cousins you've spent years trying to hide. However, and this is where the magic is, the game isn't over. In CK2 you are perfectly capable - and I know because i've done it - of taking this depleted position and slowly and methodically scheming your way to the top, courtesy of intrigue, murder and sex. By placing so much emphasis on the personal motives and intrigue, CK2 does as good a job as The Godfather or House of Cards. CK2 encourages you to fail and rewards you when you do. Success in Crusader Kings 2 makes the game harder - with far more internal threats - whilst failure motivates you to regain everything you've lost. Europa Universalis simply can't do this. It's so black and white. When you fail, if you truly fail, it's game over and when you succeed you are unstoppable. This isn't challenging and it isn't fun. It's simply a poorly made difficulty slider. The fact that EU4 lacks the political intrigue and threats of other strategy games means that its entire focus is on the military. It's a game about blobbing and colouring the map. There's nothing wrong with this, but it makes it easy and simple. the fact that it is entirely reliant on dice roll - quite literally - with two armies clashing and the winner being decided by randomly generated numeric values, means that it isn't a strategy game. It's gambling.  Strategy, by definition, is the art of creatively overcoming certain circumstances. When you have a game that presents either one nation being vastly superior to another, or, when the two are on equal footing the victor being decided by the roll of a dice, there is no strategy involved. It is luck and chance, and this makes Europea Universalis IV simple and easy.  Playing as a major nation, such as France, Austria or England, makes it impossible to genuinely be strategically outmanouvred. You will almost always have the larger army, the stronger economy, the better technology. You are fighting a downhill battle and the only things that can really defeat you are things out of your control - random events or coalitions. It's like a train without brakes - it ploughs through almost everything and the only thing to challenge it is when something else comes along and forces it off the tracks. When did this become strategy?  Truly, this game is akin to a Total War campaign where you only auto-resolve battles.  The natural opposition to what i'm saying is that you should play a more difficult nation - an OPM or technologically inferior state - however, even then it's not strategic. You only have one way to go: up. It's a slow grind, don't get me wrong, and you will often fail. However, the fact that your success as an OPM is based on a combination of good luck and slowly eating the bread crumbs until you expand large enough to steam roll, isn't tactical or strategic. It's just boring.  A strategy game should get harder as you progress - akin to what happens in CK2 - not easier. It is for these reasons that I cannot, in my right mind, recommend Europa Universalis IV.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/aceskipper1/recommended/292030,-1, The Witcher 3 has many great points and features, I'd be amiss to ignore them. The game looks beautiful; the writing and narrative are wonderfully coherent; the side quests tie in well to the context of the main storyline; the locations are exotic and exciting; there are some stellar voice acting performances (unfortunately, from the side characters); the world feels real and you are given a wide variety of choices in regards to how to play the game, based on decisions in dialogue.  Easily the most impressive thing about the game is it's ability to use narrative and dialogue to create an immersive experience, bringing the player into the world and allowing you to appreciate the story.  However, the devs missed one thing. They forgot to make the game fun.  That's not to say it's terrible, unlike its predecessor (The Witcher 2) I was able to complete this game. The latter felt like running a marathon with no legs when I tried to play, because it was so bad.  Now, I can already hear the fanboys screaming, &quot;you don't understand the game, it's a narrative driven RPG, you're too simple to appreciate a story well told through dialogue and just want action sequences&quot;. My reply: that couldn't be further from the truth. I love stories told through well presented dialogue. Reservoir Dogs is one of my all time favourite films, as is Goodfellas. I love TV shows such as House of Cards or even HBO's Rome. The Witcher 3 does have nice dialogue, it's just not a well made game.  It can't decide whether it wants to be a film or a game. Other triple A games such as Skyrim have made their mind, most (including Skyrim) abandon a well made story for fun and free gameplay. The Witcher wants to do that, but it's narrative focus makes it linear and chokes the player. You are given near to no freedom and the minor choices you make in dialogue make little to no difference on the gameplay, only impacting things such as character relations and the ending.  And even the story telling isn't good enough, despite its heavy focus. The protagonist, Geralt, is bland. To put it simply, you are playing as the most boring character in the world of The Witcher. He's the stale bread of the game. He's monotonal, emotionless and difficult to relate with. This is not what you want from a main character. The developers could easily have allowed us to play from the perspective of another character and used Geralt as a side character or companion.  Compare Geralt to a character such as Ezio or Edward from Assassin's Creed, Trevor from Grand Theft Auto V, or The Joker in Arkham Asylum.  At times, you are given the option to play as Ciri - a far more interesting character. However, when playing as her, even she seems to become bland. It's difficult to understand why, when looking at her charm in the cutscenes and when not controlling her.  However, I think I've figured it out. The main characters are reflective of the plot. They've been dumbed down into a simple, linear and boring pair in order to fit into the plot and to force the story on. The characters are a blank canvass, to allow the dialogue to shape the story. The problem is, this isn't a good thing. You have to force yourself through the game and it feels painful. I, genuinely, looked up the contents page on the wiki for the main quest at one point because I was so desperate to get to the end.  Compare this to Crusader Kings 2. You are given an actual blank canvass on that game - you can make your own character, alter their traits, alter their education and even their appearance (the appearance of the protagonists in The Witcher 3 further adds to their bland nature, with dull, grey hair reflecting their dull personality). It is a game that then throws you into the world and you are NOT limited by a linear story or a bland, pre-determined character. It is a true RPG. Each action, none of which are pre-defined, has permanent actions on the world you are in and the AI around you (all of whom are intelligent and fighting for their own ambitions, dreams and desires instead of simply being there to prop up the main character's story). I believe The Witcher 3 attempts to be like Crusader Kings 2, but fails miserably.  The supporting performances in TW3 are exotic and exciting - with Charles Dance even making a wonderful appearance - but these supporting characters are only given a snippet of on-screen time. Their well-written, acted and developed characters are whisked away with a fast-paced plot taking place in a world that is too big and too ambitious for this game.  In addition to a boring, choking and linear plot with dull main characters and not enough appearances of the side characters, the game is too big. The map is so large that you don't spend enough time in any one particular locations and don't get to appreciate it. You don't get to know the characters in the area or the recent events that happened. You cannot fall in love with the world because it is too large and the plot is too fast for it.  The side quests are repetitive, boring and take up far too much time. Why, if Geralt is so desperate to find someone, would he waste his time completing meaningless quests for side characters he's only just met?  They fall into the same pattern of: use your Witcher senses to explore or find an item. Follow an NPC. Fight a boss battle. Watch a cut scene. Rinse, dry and repeat.  The game mechanics are awful. Movement is terribly constrained and clunky, especially on horseback. Combat is a simplistic button-mashing mess, with a repetitive attack, dodge, attack strategy on every opponent you encounter (See: Mount &amp; Blade: Warband for a good combat system). Exploring isn't fun, with almost nothing new or exciting to discover and with everything tied down by the plot.  It just isn't fun to play.  The narrative focus may seem revolutionary to casual triple A gamers, but for those of us who play lesser known titles such as CK2, it is nothing.  My verdict, 5/10.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Hawkamaniac/recommended/200510,1, *Written without Enemy Within*  A good attempt to modernize X-Com for a newer audience, but one that suffers from many of the pitfalls of today's gaming mentality. The game is full of cute additions that quite quickly become incredibly annoying. The constant talking heads (some of which can be disabled in the expansion apparently), the little cutscenes, the soldier voice acting; they simply make the game less enjoyable as you go along. You can disable them, but you'd think they'd make &quot;fluff&quot; less aggrivating. There are other &quot;features&quot; that I found offputting, useless, or hindered my enjoyment. The entire &quot;Ant Farm&quot; base being a good example of something that serves absolutely no function.  Gameplay is simplified from the original X-Com quite a bit, sometimes with artificial limitations that don't make sense when looked at critically. My honest opinion about the game was that the AI cheated, or the game had no idea how to computate odds for various actions. Which is odd, given that the original X-Com; a very difficult game never felt like it cheated. It comes down to the difference in presentation: One soldier in X-Com means nothing. In Enemy Unknown it means everything. That one soldier can be the difference between failure and loss; making the AI &quot;cheating&quot; or being &quot;cheap&quot; incredibly frustrating.  Also has to be mentioned that 2K promised mod support prior to release, but then changed their tune once the game came out, including making the game &quot;call home&quot;, which nukes mod support unless you run it offline or without autoupdate. Not a cool move. There's also the bugs, which last I played were quite bad and patch support was very slow.  Despite that, it's still a solid strategy game. In no way do I think it is anywhere near the original game, but it's a solid attempt. For me, there are enough issues and questionable design decisions that I don't know if I'll ever get the enjoyment I could have out of it. If you don't have any illusions for X-Com, or just want a solid modern strategy game, it's worth a look. I'd still recommend the original over the remake.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/aceskipper1/recommended/10500,1, I had a job to do. My country, Great Britain, had just been through a century of unparalleled turbulence: an unwelcome joining of Scotland and England; religious strife; civil wars; an executed king; military dictatorship; a populist monarch restored; and the overthrow of a second king. Less than 15 years ago, the hated Catholic James II was forced into exile in the Glorious Revolution and a Protestant monarchy restored. A short, vicious war in Ireland put paid to any chance of a Catholic Stuart restoration. Nonetheless, the exiled James Stuart has sympathisers, the Jacobites, throughout Britain. Despite - or perhaps because of - this turbulent history, Britain is an engine driving the scientific and cultural advancement of northern Europe; turmoil foils creativity.  My job was fueled by my ambition and patriotism. I was to turn my country, previously fighting internally, to face outwards across the sea. Take possession of colonies in the America's and India. Destroy the French. Create the East India Company. Destroy the French. Take the archiapelago of Meditterannean islands and turn them into naval bases. Destroy the French. Use these naval bases to invade mainland Europe. Destroy the French. Claim global domination. Burn down Paris.  I successfully did this and brought glory to myself and country in a short space of time in the 18th century.  Then I came home and decided to play Empire: Total War, it was pretty good. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Hawkamaniac/recommended/564230,1, The definitive Fire Pro game. But despite that as of (June 2018) the game still has massive flaws with its online functions and workshop support. Specifically you still get desyncs in multiplayer against other people which is unacceptable and the workshop is completely broken in it's implementation. Good luck if you want to delete a guy you've downloaded. Not only do you have to unsubscribe from the mod in Steam but then you have to go into Fire Pro and manually delete the wrestler in question. The game doesn't list edits in any alphabetical listing, nor does it make this a speedy process. If you have 800 edits you've downloaded you're in for a very &quot;fun&quot; time.  There's also the issue of not delivering promised DLC content when they were supposed to. No Management of Rings mode despite being slated to be released in January 2018. Hopefully the Steam verison is updated when the PS4 copy is released later this year.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Hawkamaniac/recommended/377160,1, A solid game that doesn't really live up to its Fallout lineage. They spent far too much effort on the Settlement parts of the game to the detriment of everything else. The settlement/building not only doesn't fit the Fallout universe, it completely breaks immersion when you can instantly take apart a car that's been sitting in the wasteland for the last two hundred years.   FO4 is still a fun game if you're just looking for adventure and exploration. But if you're looking for something with more substance then that I'd steer clear. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Hawkamaniac/recommended/228260,1, Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes is one of the most criminally underlooked 4X strategy games out there. It doesn't help that Stardock itself doesn't understand the franchise and radically changed the game's structure with the inferior Sorcerer King games.  What sets FE:LH apart:  - A unique world setting. The gameworld is ruined at game start. All civilization has been destroyed by the Cataclysm and you are tasked with rebuilding. Most of the world is uninhabitable with only select places on the map being suited for colonization and wild enemies roam the map. You'll encounter quests and events from those surviving and those regarding the history of the world and its twisted creatures where even living gods were perverted.  - Many victory conditions including your usual 4X conditions such as conquering, but also an ascension to god-hood and a master quest to redeem the world itself.  - Each faction in the game can be used by different leaders and each faction plays differently allowing for quite a bit of replayability and roleplaying.  - Strong creation tools and modding allowing you to create or change the game significantly. The modding scene has dried up but many mods are still compatible.  Negatives:  - DLC is pretty lackluster with Stardock clearly trying to mine the fans of the game for more money. Among the more damning is The Dead DLC where the AI is completely inept at playing with the new faction's unique mechanics.  - Tactical combat isn't the strongest but functional. It's not anywhere near the complexity of something like Age of Wonders.  - Stardock in general. The game still has issues that they never fixed or modified and it's become clear over time that Stardock has abandoned what made this game good in order to repackage and appeal to new customers with the more limited &quot;streamlined&quot; Sorcerer King games.  While not a perfect game, Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes is a great 4X game taking place in a unique world. I highly recommend any serious TBS fans give the game a look.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/PrussianPirate/recommended/200110,1, Very deep and competitive PvP Brawler/FPS.  Due to its innovative gameplay, you can't compare it to classical genres.  All the different classes that can be also customized offer also a very strategic experience with lots of complex and possible combinations of teams and the classes themself.   Beginners might find it difficult to keep up to all the task one has to fulfill in order to play a good round but the game is worth every second of playing :)

https://steamcommunity.com/id/PrussianPirate/recommended/394320,1, I can only agree with the review that states how misleading the User reviews are on this DLC. A free patch (2.5) actually implemented the new Infamy mechanic with the new coalitions aswell as the new retreating-status of armies.  Of course it's once again 15¢ã for something that possibly should be free like the last patch or not being sold for more than 5¢ã, but this is another story.  About this DLC, it's just fine, i really like how the council got emphasized in importance. Also the new Opinion scale they patched in seems to be made for this DLC as it balances the newly added focus you've got to keep on your vassals.  PS: Luckily enough I haven't encountered any muslim coalitions lead by the pope e.g. yet, but I hope Paradox will fix these historical issues with coalitions being also based on an opinion modifier etc. (Only my saves seem to have been harmed a little^^)  PSS: I enjoy every additional DLC for the Paradox Grand Strategy games as much as any other addict. And in my opinion its okay-ish that they continue adding content if they made prices more fair maybe. Also I'd rather have this game getting more and more depth and content than a new CK3 that starts from Vanilla with 8325760 DLCs to come. *sigh* 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/PrussianPirate/recommended/538020,-1, Good content and another must have for a Paradox addict like me. ?(?Òæ??) But at what cost?   Please introduce season passes or other ways to cope with that DLC flood.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/SemyonTheGreat/recommended/285110,1, *capitalist fat dude in top hat*  and yep, magadan (was) definitely the richest place in USSR and whole world as well  the developer doesn't seem to be slacking and quality of life improvements are there, even mod tools too it seems  surely this is rather serious simulation compared to maybe any i seen at all - and it's quite fun in that  numerous AIs compete quite well and iirc it's not easy to wrestle much of market from them; the only downside was maybe either poor longterm planning or maybe not strong enough problem fixing when scit happens like lengthy world wars  and yet i suppose it's pretty realistic that they succumb to ruined business - yet game seems to allow survival in some of the direst conditions with good enough plans  currently (1.23) game map is kind of compressed with smaller and weird younger cities cut - but old one (1.21 or even older) is still there to play with 264 cities including even north korea, sibera, kyrgyzstan. etc.  1 massive problem might persist however: while game allows like 1440 turns in timeframe of 1900-2020 - it seems savegames awfully bloat (database issue) even in like ~30-35 years which overall makes it unplayable in super long timeframes (this was in 1.21 older experience; now i have no idea - there is a new option to autopurge reports older than 5 years but not sure if it works well yet)  previously as well there was bit too much clumsiness and excessive management (or more like redundant actions, templates) required - now it's on path to eradication  all in all it's definitely interesting game, simulation and worth a buy now - i'd say plenty of different styles and replayability too 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/SemyonTheGreat/recommended/640140,1, Accompanying 2.8 (((free real estate))) patch expanded tibetan plateau with extra provinces, lands instead of wastelands, similar bits of additions seem to be in iranian area;  This expansion probably has the most value for expanded modding possibilities (like previous M&amp;M), which probably are most fitting for fantasy stuff like game of thrones mod and such;  However still this expansion adds 'off-map', yet probably ultimately powerful foe/challenge to fight(invade, install your dynasty), which is great addition i think; + variability to silk road trade;  If you wonder what are the added casus bellis - it seems they are levy/manpower tributary wars + religious kingdom sized liberation(then tributary) in limited cases + similar large realm great conquest + limited force vassalize + bunch of ducal conquest/border dispute  That means you generally can start wars at will(with neighbors) with some drawbacks like poor opinion about that + have some excuse to simpler/conquering within a duchy where you own at least something (however CBs as well are kind of costly in one way or another) - should be a welcome addition to a warmonger  EDIT: also my quite old playthrough started a long while ago at earliest playable date(charlemagne) now only in like 12th century still(near world conquest roman empire) - was started in possibly even 2.5 patch(or 2.4, or even earlier), by now that means like 3-4 last dlcs(since reaper's due?) were added to it, map expanded, systems expanded - and it all still seems to work/load, empty lands got kind of auto-anschlussed into neighboring realms gradually in ~15 days - finally paradox makes stuff so it keeps working(or simply unlike in eu4) 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/PrussianPirate/recommended/227760,1, It's good for what it is! I prefer Victoria 2 over this (and all other Pdx' titles) and can also see why people think this game stands no chance against EU4.  However, March of the Eagles focuses on a rather short time period around the Battle of Waterloo 1815.  So don't expect too much!  So what is this game?  Maybe it doesn't convince as much in terms of Grand Strategy as other Paradox titles,  but it has a good potential and the military aspect is well done.  So the huge contra is that PDS simply abandoned this game and left it with all the flaws :-(

https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/512350,1, I finally put a lot of hours into CAU last night, going through all 12 of the new police missions, buying all the police cars, doing several crate delivery missions (as a bad guy) and joining in several police chases (to stop the bad guy). I also levelled up to 60 in the process.  My opinion is that the new chases are great fun. They add a new dimension to the gameplay, which frankly has become a little stale after 500+ hours in the game. The police chases freshen it up a lot. It's much more exciting to be chased by real players than the AI police, while chasing down and arresting real players is extremely satisfying.  However, the DLC is very poor value for money, unless you don't own Wild Run, in which case it's great value for money because you get both. If you've already purchased Wild Run, then it's a bit of a rip off. They really should have sold it at a discount for Wild Run owners.  The good news: you don't have to own CAU to be a criminal and do the crate delivery missions, so everybody gets half of the new content for free!  The bad news: there are only 12 new missions and the story is pretty much non-existent. Unlike the original story missions there are no cut-scenes for most of them, so we don't even get to see the bad guy we're after. We're just chasing a name. The missions don't take long to complete, I did them all in an hour or so, and I got no sense of satisfaction or connection to the so called story. I expected a lot more, like the original story that was much more engaging.  Having said that, the new missions are a lot of fun and I spent a lot of time repeating many of them, trying to score platinum in each. That's a very quick way to level up your police cars. Due to the nature of the chases, they can be different each time. In fact, doing badly is more fun than catching them quickly because you get a longer chase to enjoy.  The real fun though, is chasing (or being chased by) real players rather than the idiot AI who are usually quite easy to beat (except on the harder missions). And of course, there are a few new cars available and being a cop in supercar is really cool.  In summary: It's a lot of fun and I'm really enjoying it, but it's very poor value for money if you already own Wild Run. If you love this game, you've probably bought it already, but if you haven't, why not? If you don't have Wild Run, it's very good value. If you're on the fence, wait for a sale. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/341950,1, Lux Delux is a Risk style game, similar in many ways to the original but with several extra features. Although the game mechanics are very simple, the strategy is often quite challenging.   https://youtu.be/DTupYOTo90Q  Probably the most outstanding feature of this game is that there are over 900 maps available, providing endless variety in the gameplay. Most of these are created by users so the quality varies widely, but there are more than enough good maps to keep you occupied.   https://youtu.be/vkfetLs8z0g  Another great feature is the AI, which is really well programmed. There's around a dozen bots of different difficulty levels, each of which has a different playstyle. The hard bots are REALLY tough to beat! Additionally there's multiplayer so there's plenty of humans to go up against.  Graphics are pretty basic, but they're perfectly functional for this kind of game. Many of the maps are really well designed.  It's a fairly quick game to play, although it can take longer on some bigger maps or against tougher opponents, so it's great for when you have 10 or 20 minutes to spare.  I recommend this for anyone who craves a quick strategy fix but doesn't have enough time for a full game of Civ 5 or Hearts of Iron 3!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/241560,1, The Crew is a multiplayer always-online arcade-racer set in a huge open world which is a condensed version of the United States. It was designed by many of the same people who created Test Drive Unlimited, so it can effectively be thought of as TDU 3. It contains many of the same features, but not all (no houses or shops).   http://youtu.be/CBYh4vPmH2k  I think many people are unfairly critical of this game, and are failing to appreciate the best feature, the huge open world. In reality, the world area is only around 5000 sq km (about a quarter of the size of Wales), yet that's still a huge size for a game world, possibly the second largest open world racing game (Fuel is over twice as big). Road wise, there's 10,000 km of roads, 10 times as much as in the first TDU game, so that will take a long time to explore properly. But it's not just the size of the world that's impressive, it's the attention to detail and the huge number of landmarks. It's extremely well designed.  The USA is not only condensed, but distorted, some areas are much larger than others. This is necessary since if everything was to scale, every city would be a tiny village. Instead, the biggest cities are made much larger, as well as features like the Grand Canyon, while less interesting areas are shrunk in size. The result is greatly distorted, but it feels really good to drive around, and I believe it does a good job of representing the &quot;highlights&quot; of the USA in a way which suits a computer game very well.   https://youtu.be/vNx4FtHofwU  Many people have complained about the horrible car physics. I was a bit shocked at this too in the beginning, but it turns out that the early cars handle badly by design, and get much better as you upgrade them with parts. The few cars I've tried from the DLCs handle much better. It also takes a little while to tweak your wheel or controller settings to get it to feel good, but it's worth the effort.   http://youtu.be/KksGtk6F-i8  Apparently rubber banding is also a problem in the game, although I did read someone say it's been fixed. I've noticed it a few times with police chases, but it doesn't seem to be much of a problem to me. Speaking of police chases, I find them to be a lot of fun, while others seem to hate them. Similarly, the raid challenges can be quite frustrating, but are also fun to me. Depends on your point of view I suppose.  The GPS tends to provide the shortest route between two points, which is often not the best way to get to where you want quickly (taking you through backstreets instead of sticking to main roads), but hey, SatNav does that in real life too! Just think of it as a guide that you don't have to stick to. Learning the main roads and using your &quot;local knowledge&quot; instead can save time! Also it tends to suggest offroad shortcuts, which can be annoying if you want to stick to roads, but on the other hand, it gives you a route through difficult scenery which you might otherwise get stuck in.  One annoying thing I have noticed is graphical glitches during the cut scene intros to most missions. Don't know what's causing this, but it's only a minor irritation, it doesn't happen when I'm driving.  Another slight peeve is that much of the terrain is too destructible, you can drive straight through lamp posts and other features as if they weren't even there, yet some are rock solid. It's sometimes hard to know which is which. Okay, so it's just an arcade game so you could say it's excusable, but it does lead to bad driving habits, driving through obstacles that you'd normally avoid. In fact, to win certain missions it's often a good idea to crash through things.   https://youtu.be/blIdOUmGMh8  Same goes for crashing into other cars, often (not always) this has little or no effect, barely slowing you down in most instances. Again, I don't like this because it encourages bad driving habits, not caring about hitting other cars when normally you should try to avoid them at all costs. But again, it's an arcade game, so I can live with it.  Sure, there are a few faults with this game, but most of them hardly matter to me. The game world is so large, with so many places to go, so many things to see (there's educational info on historical landmarks) and so many cars to drive (not a huge selection, but there are many variants of each, and who needs hundreds of cars anyway?) that I'm having too much fun cruising and exploring to take much notice of the faults. I think if people focused less on the faults and concentrated more on the fun aspects of the game, they'd enjoy it a lot more.  For me the FreeDrive mode is the real game, going on road trips solo or with friends. I dont' really care about the missions and the story that much (although they do add a nice bit of character to the game), I just want to explore America!  Having said that, the game gets more interesting the deeper you get into it. As you level up you unlock factions and faction missions, and that adds a lot more fun to the game, not to mention money! Some say that money is hard to come by and there's a lot of grinding, but they're wrong, money is easy to make. It's not a &quot;pay to win&quot; game, you can pay if you're lazy, but you can make it easily enough by simply playing the game.  I'm really enjoying The Crew and I highly recommend it to positive gamers who enjoy exploring a huge open world, who don't mind the arcadey gameplay and can live with a few faults. Be sure to get the Gold Edition or buy the Season Pass to get a bunch of good cars that unlock fairly early in the game, to give you a decent variety of cars to go free roaming in, otherwise you'll be stuck with the early cars for a while.  Negative focused nit-pickers need not apply!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/211500,1, RaceRoom is an excellent sim racer made by the same people behind Simbin, makers of Race 07 and other great sims. It's worthy of serious consideration by everyone who loves sim racing. Don't be fooled by the many bad reviews, there's a good reason for them, which I'll explain later. There's also more good news later.   https://youtu.be/itBXrA2QEEM   http://youtu.be/I7URfx-CpwE  Raceroom offers a large collection of cars (75 in total) and tracks (25 in total, many of which have several different layouts) and 3 competitions (2 DTM and ADAC) which are called &quot;Experiences&quot;. These Experiences give you full seasons with teams and drivers. In short, there's a lot of variety in this game.  I haven't put many hours into this game yet, but so far I've found the racing &quot;experience&quot; to be extremely good. Physics are very realistic and the AI seems pretty good too. One very nice feature is the ARI (Adapative Racing Intelligence) which adjusts the difficulty level automatically to match your skill and experience. At first I wasn't impressed with this since the AI drivers were driving too slowly, but apparently the difficulty level starts low and increases over time. After a few races the AI had adapted to my level and started to provide some decent competition without being overly difficult to beat.  There are three racing modes; Novice, Amateur and Get Real. Novice is a bit of a joke since it actually brakes for you as you approach the corners. Amateur has realistic physics, but with traction control, ABS and zero damage. Get Real turns the driving aids off (but damage is still optional). It's a pity I couldn't configure all these things separately, I'd like to have driven on Amateur level but with damage turned on for example.  Now the bad news...  Many people have criticised this game for being free to play but with very little content. That's true, but what do you expect for free? You get 5 different cars and 3 tracks (each with several variations), more than enough to evaluate the quality of the game and give you some great racing fun for no more than the price of the download.  Think of it this way, the &quot;free to play&quot; game is just a demo, the REAL game is in the addon packs. Three of the DLCs currently available on Steam are &quot;Experiences&quot; - full seasons with tracks and cars - DTM 2013 and 2014, ADAC 2014. It actually makes more sense to buy these as DLCs rather than buying a whole new game every year, as with the F1 games. The fourth DLC is just a car pack, not an &quot;Experience&quot;.  Here's where the problems begin...  The three Experience DLCs contain a lot of duplicate content. They mostly use the same tracks and some of the same cars. For example, the two DTM packs only have 1 track and 1 car different. This makes buying all the DLCs a waste of money, because you're paying for mostly the same content that you've already bought.  To confuse matters even more, there are many more packs you can buy that aren't available as Steam DLCs, as well as individual cars and tracks, some of which are not available in any packs. You can buy them in-game or from their website. These are bought using the in-game currency of vRP points, so you can't see what they cost in real money. However, if you add the items to your cart you can see the cost.  I created a spreadsheet to show what's available in each pack, which you may find helpful;   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=445609150  Whoever came up with this ridiculous marketing/sales model should be fired. It confuses buyers and can result in wasted money buying duplicate content. Judging by the number of negative reviews, this has backfired on them, which is a pity. I hope they don't go bankrupt again because of this!  Fortunately, there is some good news...  While experimenting with adding various packs to the cart on their website, I discovered that they DON'T CHARGE FOR DUPLICATE CONTENT! They know what cars and tracks you own, so you don't pay extra for what you already have. So if you already own DTM 2013, DTM 2014 will be cheaper as a result. I wanted to buy all the tracks but was loathe to buy the European Track Pack for just one extra track, but when I added it to my cart, it cost less than a pound extra, less than half the price of buying that track individually!  So, it's okay to buy ONE Experience pack from Steam, but if you want any more, buy them from their site instead. Also, don't worry about duplicate content, you won't be charged for it.  Even more good news, the more packs you buy at one time, the cheaper they get. There's a cumulative discount, so if you're going to buy any packs, buy as many as you can afford to save more money. I bought 7 items and got a 16% discount. If you buy all the packs I think you get a discount of around 30%  To give you an idea of cost, I spent less than ?30 to get all the tracks and about a third of the cars. I could have gotten all of the tracks cheaper than that, but I wanted some extra cars as well. Two tracks are not contained in any pack. Buying all the packs would cost around ?70 I think, but unless you're a collector who has to have everything, it doesn't need to cost that much.  CONCLUSION: I highly recommend this game to all sim racers. Those who prefer casual or arcade racing should probably avoid this game (but by all means try the &quot;demo&quot; first). The DLCs, packs and points method of selling this game is overly complex and confusing, but if you like this game, don't be put off by that, it's well worth the hassle, and it's much cheaper to buy the extras direct from the game or their website, NOT FROM STEAM!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/416080,1, In this game you play as the goddess Athena, who's job it is to guide Odysseus' boats to safety. You do this by altering the wind strength, which always blows toward their destination, and by dragging your mouse through the sea to create currents.  This sounds simple enough, but you also have to prevent the ships from hitting rocks and sand bars, and avoiding other dangers like a cyclops throwing rocks at them (you can catch the rocks by clicking on them with the mouse). Additionally you need to direct the boats to statues to unlock gates and there are also bonuses to pick up along the way. Naturally it gets harder as you progress, with newer dangers and more difficult maps to negotiate.  Although the graphics are pleasing, the resolution is only 640x480. You have a choice of full screen or windowed.  To be honest, it's not my type of game and it didn't hold my interest for very long, but it's by no means a bad game. It wouldn't appeal to everyone, but it's fairly challenging and I'm sure some gamers would enjoy it.  Conclusion: a decent casual game ideal for a quick play when you don't have much time to spare.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/260330,1, Flockers is an action puzzle game in much the same style as Lemmings, created by Team17, makers of Worms, so you know the pedigree is good.   https://youtu.be/YQXgOCYvZFg  For those who don't remember the classic Lemmings, it was a game in which a number of &quot;lemmings&quot; (which looked more like human workers to me) were released and would walk through the landscape, following each other like the archetypal lemmings, blindly walking off cliffs to their death. Your job as the player was to guide the lemmings by giving specific instructions to them, for example to build bridges or dig into the landscape, in order to guide as many of them to safety as possible.  Flockers uses essentially the same concept, but with sheep instead of lemmings. Appropriately so, since sheep also have the habit of following one another. This time around, rather than natural landscapes, you have to help them navigate through extremely dangerous factory complexes, filled with saws, spikes, hammers and other nasty objects, often with gory results as your mindless sheep stroll blindly into them.  Each level is a puzzle. They're large, and get progressively more complicated as you progress through them. You can zoom in and out to get a better view of the puzzle you have to solve. Sheep may wander off in different directions, you may meet more sheep along the way, transporters teleport sheep to different locations and it can sometimes be a bit confusing to understand what's going on the first time you try a new level.  As you go through each level, sheep step on buttons which activate machinery, sometimes in a good way, sometimes in a very bad way, so you have to be very careful what you let them step on. They also encounter crates, which when opened give you new abilities that you can assign to your your sheep. It may take a few attempts to figure out how to get through a level.  While you often need to get only one sheep to safety (in the early levels at least), getting more will score you more points, as will doing it in a faster time. You also get a bonus for using fewer abilities. You can retry levels to get a better score, and you can compare your score to your friends.  The levels are very detailed, perhaps overly so, which can make it tricky to figure out how to solve them. But maybe that's the point, distracting you with unimportant details. Fortunately, although it's an action game, you can pause it at any time, giving you the opportunity to study the puzzle at your leisure. You still have to solve it in real time though, giving commands to your sheep as they move. Pressing the right mouse button gives you a bigger &quot;brush&quot;, enabling you to give commands to multiple sheep at the same time.  The graphics are very good, and very gory as sheep get smashed and sawed, spiked and gored, with blood splattering everywhere, which is rather amusing if you find that sort of thing funny. For this reason the game has an age rating. But if you don't like that sort of thing, you can simply turn off the gore in the video options.  I haven't played this game for very long yet, but my first impressions are very good. I'm finding it both challenging and amusing, an enjoyable casual way to pass the time. The price is very reasonable and it's on sale at the moment, so this is a great time to grab it if you're interested. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/438340,1, Drizzlepath: Genie is a walking simulator that takes you on a journey through beautiful scenery. The rain soaked atmosphere is very relaxing. It's not as dark as Dear Esther. The colours are quite muted, but that's appropriate for an overcast day. The landscape contains various locations and objects of interest and it's worth looking around to find things you might otherwise miss.  Occasional voice narration enhances the experience. It's extremely poetic and descriptive, painting pictures in words to further enhance the visuals. There's also relaxing music providing a soundtrack to your journey. It's pleasant enough to listen to but can get repetitive at times. I usually turn music off once that happens (which it does with all games), and often play without music or replace it with music of my own choice. It would be nice to have that option added. It's enjoyable enough just listening to the rain IMO.  There are many excellent opportunities for screenshots in this game, which can extend the gameplay time considerably. There's a control to zoom out to give a wider angle of view and another to crouch, which can provide you with a different viewpoint. You can even change to a grainy, monochrome view which gives a completely different look to the game, and is good for &quot;arty&quot; screenshots.  In spite of the overcast sky, sunlight does stream through gaps in the clouds. Unusually it shines from multiple directions. Perhaps this planet orbits multiple suns? This sunlight causes purple lens flare, which often looks appealing, but sometimes I felt there was a bit too much of it and I wished I could turn it off. UPDATE: If you set filter effects to medium or low the lens flare will be disabled.  It may be worth noting that I have not experienced any of the micro-stutters than mrorange mentioned in his review.  I don't understand what everything means in this game because I haven't completed it yet. In fact, I've only been exploring the green path so far (there are two different paths through the game), but after three hours I think I've experienced enough to write this review. I'll update it once I've played more. Unfortunately I suffer from motion sickness in first person games so I can't play them for too long without feeling ill. I also take loads of screenshots so it'll take me a lot longer to complete than if I simply walked through it all without stopping.  Overall this is a very pleasant visual and aural experience (rather than a game) which I recommend to anyone who enjoys simply walking around and looking at beautiful scenery. It's a treat to the senses and is ideal for relaxation when you feel like taking a break from more demanding games.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/gartenfurz/recommended/211820,-1, Pro: - interesting setting - low learning curve - very diverse building blocks - multiple races and the racism that naturally occurs between races (no sugar coating of reality) - engaging fasttravel system, that doesn't unnecessarily shrink the world - varied combat weapons and abilities  Con: - trivial difficulty, easy enemies, easy self-healing - extremely quick progression - no need to build - no nostaliga moments, as you simply switch planets instead of conquering a world - poor performance despite bing a pixel art game - slow development, Early Access for the ages - short sense of exploration, because progress is quick you opt into landing, digging, mining -&gt; next tier -&gt; repeat - food/buffs are meaningless - unprecise movement - early movement upgrades - crafting &gt; finding / unlocking  The first time I got Starbound I managed to &quot;finish&quot; the game so quickly that it didn't last an saturday afternoon. Expected from early access. Now, years later, it doesn't seem to have changed much other than it takes slightly longer, because now there are missions between the tiers. They aren't difficult nor are they that interesting. The first game of this sandbox type I played was Terraria and I played that in it's early stages too. The difficulty was higher but not torturing but more importantly, you felt the need to connect with your world. If you went to far in one direction or too deep you ended up fighting monsters outside of your current combat strengh. In Starbound the transition from a weak explorer to a stronger one is very clearly cut. It's switching the planet you're exploring. And it's not like you can go to higher tiers earlier to seek out a challenge because you'll end up dealing with constant health loss due to artificially giving the next tier of planet something you later deal with passively by progression. Starbound had the need to stay warm in early stages and it slowed you down. Apparently enough people complained for this to be removed. But that's exactly what made Terraria great and Starbound badly designed now: You explore too quickly. In Terraria you had little means of moving around until you were well into higher tiers. In Starbound you get doublejump, anti-fall damage and grapple hooks (good idea but it speeds up everything) and then you blast your way through worlds. No need to build anything either. You put the crafting stations on your ship and that's that. Either you love spending time on housing and then do it or you completely skip it. That might sound like a nice thing. Do what you want and skip everything else. But one of the most important parts of a task is to have a purpose. Good design creats the need  and  desire to do something, which Starbound fails to do. If you enjoy housing building there are better ways to do it. If you enjoy exploring there are better ways to do it. If you enjoy combat there are a lot better ways to do it.  Starbound had potential and probably still has. But it doesn't seem like the developer is moving in a direction which attacks there points. The ease of access to everything doesn't make for a good game. It makes for a good level editor but that's not what Starbound wants to be or would perform well at either. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/gartenfurz/recommended/233250,1, I really enjoy Planetary Annihilation, despite not liking RTS otherwise.  - The learning curve.. ..doesn't seem too steep and the units are pretty straight forward and don't need brutal micromanagement because they don't have special skills to activate. On top of that you get some pretty  awesome and powerful tools  to ease the micromanagement of your armies like patrol a route or area and other things like &quot;reclaim area&quot; which saves up a lot of thinking and micromanaging when you start to scale your war efforts up to hundreds of units (each commandable on it's own).  - The game play is.. ..quite well already and doesn't feel as incomplete as other Early Access games. Definitly worth playing now, despite minor hickups and laggs when things get hot (though this might be more a problem of m 4 year old gaming notebook). The fact that you're fighting on multiple maps (planets) makes it so much more engaging than having a fixed strategy for a certain map and executing it quicker and better than the other player means winning the game.  - Multi-Team and dynamic-Teams.. ..really is something I missed in the last years (though I didn't try that many RTS). The last RTS I remember having dynamic alliances was C&amp;C Red Alert (1). It adds so much to the game when you can actively react to the game flow other than building units. It means you interact with the player and not only the game. And of course, having multiple planets goes so well with having multiple teams. I've watched massive games with 25 people fighting in teams of 5 over one planet and I've watched a game on youtube where they played 5v10v10 where they ended the game with a massive annihilation of the primary planet when a team gained control of the two moons. Really intensifies the gameplay beyond simple warfare.  - Galactic War.. ..is the sort-of singleplayer campain where I'm currently learning to play different strategies. You start out only having access to the vehicle factory (first commander you have) and within one war (campain) you add new abilities by defeating foes on planet systems. I do hope they add coop galactic war and extend it (add a new game mode) which is like Tactical Commander/Shatterd Galaxies and Planet Side 2 where you take over Systems as part of a greater group of players. I do believe that's being planned but I don't know for sure.  - Ongoing development.. ..I don't usually count this as a bonus point because it usually also means the current game feels incomplete, however, Planetary Annihilation is already stable and complex enough to enjoy for hours on end. At this point, having new stuff flowing in just adds to the fun.  - System Editor.. ..create your own systems and planet designs to fit special multiplayer matches. What's not to love about that?   All in all I'm glad I picked up during summer sale and excited to have an RTS for once that doesn't annoy me. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/70210,1, Governor of Poker 2 is an enjoyable poker game set in the Wild West, that offers more than just poker. There's a long campaign where you travel to different cities, play in various tournaments, encounter a variety of different opponents (including notorious ones), purchase buildings, and best of all, you get to buy new hats!   https://youtu.be/obuXfORI8v0  A big feature of real poker is the tells on your opponents faces, but in this game you don't see faces, just hats! In spite of this, the game does a pretty good job of giving different personalities to the characters through their voices and actions, and there are tells in the form of comments they make and other information, such as getting steamy when they lose.  A big part of the game is travelling to different cities and buying buildings, which provide you with passive income. At first you can only make money from playing poker, but once you own a reasonable number of buildings you have a steady income trickling in. The idea is to build up your reputation and take over different cities. You can borrow money from the bank if necessary, or sell buildings if you have any, and of course, you can buy new hats. New hats impart some personality to the players and allow you to enter new tournaments.  The gameplay is fairly fast paced, it's an ideal game for a quick poker fix, but I'm not sure whether the cards played are truly random and whether the AI cheats or not. Some reviews claim that it does. I'm not experienced at poker so I can't really tell, but as a casual player the gameplay seems decent to me, even though I find it pretty hard to win, even on the standard level. The Telltale poker games are a lot more fun if you want personality and banter, but for a simple poker fix, this does the job and is better than other poker games I've tried. There's no multiplayer, so look elsewhere if that's what you want, but it provides a good single player experience  The graphics are fairly basic, and low res too, but they're functional and pleasant to look at. There are free versions of this you can play on the internet but this version, the premium edition, provides more depth.  Overall I'd recommend this game for casual players, especially because of the extra interest that the campaign provides. Serious poker players may want to look elsewhere though. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/gartenfurz/recommended/570,1, It's free. Try it.  Don't expect to be able to beat bots just because you play LoL. This isn't LoL. You're not good at Quake because you aimassist yourself through CoD and you're not good at Dota2 just because you LoL'd to gold rank. (I'm a LoL player, obviously.) 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/gartenfurz/recommended/39510,-1, W¨¹rde das Spiel nat¨¹rlich jedem empfehlen, der eine klasse Geschichte, ein anspruchsvolles Kampfsystem und eine liebevoll gestaltete Welt sucht. Ich kann es aber nicht f¨¹r Steam empfehlen (auch nicht die GOG Version, die ich aber nicht kenne). Auf meinem Spielerechner startet es nicht, obwohl ich es bereits auf derselben Hardware bereits mehr mals durchgespielt habe. Ich kriege nicht einmal den Startspashscreen, wenn Skype noch l?uft. Gothic 2 hat jede Menge Unvertr?glichkeiten mit anderer Software oder Treibern, sodass es gut m?glich ist, dass selbst alle Fixes die im Netz geposted sind, nichts n¨¹tzen und man am Ende ein unstartbares Spiel Hat. Interessanter Weise klappt es (mit den bekannten Spielbugs) aber auf meinem neuen Arbeitsultrabook mit Win8 64Bit.  Wer sich die M¨¹he macht und einen alten Rechner oder ein Dualboot mit WinXP laufen l?sst, kann (wahrscheinlich) bedenkenlos zugreifen. Auf neueren Systemen kann es sein, dass G2 gar nicht startet oder st?ndig abst¨¹rzt (beim Freund so). 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/gartenfurz/recommended/232910,1, If you enjoyed the free TrackMania Nations you'll enjoy this one too. Basically it's just an update with better performance (for me at least) and graphics and no annyoing online limitations of the freeware version of TM Nations. If you already have a limitation free TM Nations you don't really need to upgrade unless you want to be at the heartbeat of the community. I'm sure it's still pretty active on the predecessor though. You do get to use steam workshop though which makes handling maps more comfortable.  For anyone completely new to TrackMania, be sure to invest in a controller with a very fine joystick (Xbone One seems fit). My old Logitech controller isn't fit for the fine adjustments because the stick needs too much force to move. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/gartenfurz/recommended/105600,1, As far as 2D exploration games with building and mining goes, Terraria is the first that I'd recommend to anyone. It's quite complex without being too complex for first time sandbox players and it evolved to delivering hours of gameplay even if you just rush to kill and explore everything there is in a single &quot;playthrough&quot;.  Pros: - Finished - Much content - well balanced - dedicated servers - etc.  Cons: - Needs portforwarding to host servers which can be confusing for some - once you know the ins and outs of the game the next time you pick it up you'll rush through it

Viel mehr gibt's dazu nicht zu erz?hlen. Nur Freunde sollte man einplanen. Alleine macht wesentlich weniger Spass und spielt sich anstrengender.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/gartenfurz/recommended/207140,1, I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes playing quick, competitive racing games with weapons. Even more so if you have a bunch of friends to play with locally. Occasionally all my flatmates squeeze infront of my PC and we play for just half an hour (to be honest it usually extends to 90 minutes before anybody gets back to learning).  Pros: - local/online multiplayer (no need to have 4 PCs running just because one person isn't around) - community involvement (I think so) - easy to learn with complexity to master (dodging grapples, setting up grapple traps) - leveleditor - fun is primary goal - best racing game on the PC that compares to the good old N64 Mario Kart  Cons: - I'll have to think of some.. it doesn't support webcams to record your friends face just when you grappled them to their death 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/banana_joe/recommended/493340,1, I played RCT2 and Theme Park World back in the good old days.   Unfortunately my old PC was way below the minimum requirements for this game.  This week i finished building my new expensive rig, i tested around and all was fine.   I bought Planet Coaster, started it and was already pleased by this beautiful menu, then i fired the beginners scenario up, and i literally cried.   This is the most beautiful game i have ever seen.   I immediatly went into ego-perspective of a visitor and just looked for half an hour at the scenery and the ultra-awesome details in this game.   This is a masterpiece.   Wow. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/banana_joe/recommended/326160,-1, Anfang 2015 in Erwartung eines Ultima Online-Nachfolgers gekauft. In UO hab ich ne gef¨¹hlte Lebenszeit investiert (auf dem fantastischen freeshard Siebenwind).   Shroud of the Avatar ist aber leider eher ein 3D-Immobilienmanager in einem unattraktiven, leblosen Setting.  Und es scheint so als w¨¹rden die Entwickler es dabei belassen.   Dagegen wirkt Ultima IX wie ein stabiler AAA-RPG-Superhit - wahrscheinlich will Lord British sich diesmal einen Flug zum Mars finanzieren.  Ich kann nur empfehlen sich mal ¨¹ber &quot;Legends of Aria&quot; schlau zu machen, das wirkt wesentlich vielversprechender als UO-Nachfolger und soll in diesem Jahr (2017) auf Steam erscheinen. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/banana_joe/recommended/464920,1, Absolute fantastic game. I was sceptical at first because Haemimont Games from my perspective completely messed up Tropico 5 with unnecessary Multiplayer-Capabilities which simplified the singleplayer-experience to such an extent that i had no fun playing it anymore.  But here they delivered.  30 and way more hours easily can go into one map. There is a little bit need for micromanagement (assigning drones and carrying ressources around in the early game) which can be a little bit tedious after a while but all other parts of the game are mostly completely automatic.  The production lines are clever, the techtree is very nice, the dome-principle is suprisingly funny and also the different story lines are really catching.  I don't regret paying full price for it and i hope there will be a lot more content coming soon without making the game too easy.  You should absolutely get this if you love agent based simulation/colonybuilding games with heavy focus on ressources and productionlines like Gnomoria, Tropico3+4 and so on.  Edit: After reading through the plenty negative reviews here i can only sum up it as mostly misunderstanding the core mechanics of the game. People complain about colonists dying on the way between domes or drones not delivering ressources on long range. These are hardships which are embedded in the game and can be overcome with technology a bit later.  It's sad that this masterpiece get's downvoted so much and i hope the devs don't change core mechanics overhasty based on these critiques. Imho simply giving colonists the ability to use services in other domes would make the game way too easy and i actually think that building somewhat specialized domes in different configs &amp; fulfill all necessary needs of the residents is the key point here which makes the dome-principle actually somewhat challenging and interesting. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/banana_joe/recommended/552700,1, Perfekte Synthese aus Final Fantasy und Pokemon.   Leveldesign und Story, wie von Square Enix seit vielen Jahren gewohnt, ¨¹berragend.   Stapelmechanik gibt dem ¨¹blichen Monsterkampfsystem eine ganz neue Dimension.  Absolut empfehlenswert.  Einziger Wermutstropfen: F¨¹r heutige Verh?ltnisse etwas sehr linear - aber ist verschmerzbar.    PS.: Am besten einen Controller benutzen.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/446800,1, This game is the spiritual successor to Transport Tycoon, but brought up to date in full 3D glory. First impressions are very good. On the surface it looks just like Train Fever with ships and planes added, but there's a lot more to it than that. It runs on a new game engine for a start, which solves the worst problem of the previous game, namely track and road laying, which could often be extremely frustrating. It's still not perfect, but it's considerably improved, with far more complex track connections possible.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=796614848  The scenery is a lot more detailed when you look closely at it, with many more different buildings in the towns. The vehicle models are really well done, and they become dirty and rusty over time. Distant scenery blends better into the background with a misty effect.  The most significant change is that they've done away with the 20 minute rule and replaced it with catchment areas, which is probably more familiar in these types of games. Journeys can be of any length now, but passengers still prefer quicker transport. With freight it doesn't matter so much, especially with ships that can carry huge amounts of cargo but travel very slowly.  Along with that, resources and products no longer move on their own, instead you have to transport everything yourself and place stations in appropriate catchment areas to ensure that everything gets delivered to the right places. Industries now have more complex resource requirements. If part of the supply chain is missing it will grind to a halt. This makes the game more challenging compared to Train Fever, in which you could provide partial transport routes and the AI would automatically fill in the gaps.  In keeping with the more complex industries, there are now six different types of products that need to be transported to towns, three to the commercial districts and three to the industrial districts. This makes things even more complex since you need to use more depots to ensure the town is well supllied, although you apparently only need to supply one industrial and one commercial product (in addition to passenger transport) to help cities grow, making the more complex industrial chains seem somewhat unnecessary.  Regarding money, even on the easy level there can be a lot of time spent waiting to make a profit  from your lines before you can expand, and the harder levels are much more difficult. If you prefer to build without limits, you can apply a mod which removes money from the game, but you don't get any achievements in that mode.  In addition to the main random game, there are also two campaigns included, one for Europe and one for the USA, featuring several scenarios each. I haven't tried these myself, but they provide you with a story and clear goals to win each scenario. They're probably a good way to help learn the game if you haven't played Train Fever previously.  To sum up, Transport Fever can be very engrossing. Personally I'm finding it just as addictive as Civilization, but instead of &quot;one more turn&quot; there's always one more line to create, a new train to build, vehicles to upgrade, a line to update or some other problem to solve. &quot;I'll just finish doing this then I'll go to bed, but I need to sort out that problem first, oh and there's that other thing I need to look at, and while I'm at it...&quot;  If you enjoy these types of games, this is a no brainer. We've been waiting a very long time for a spiritual successor to Transport Tycoon. Many similar games have come and gone over the years, but this is the first that truly deserves that accolade. It's the best game in the genre in my opinion. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/banana_joe/recommended/427520,1, Ohne gro?e Erwartungen gestartet und direkt 8 Stunden am St¨¹ck gespielt. Ein wirklich fantastisches Game voller T¨¹ftelei und Komplexit?t. Das letzte mal hat mich Banished so sehr gefesselt. Absolute Kaufempfehlung.  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/banana_joe/recommended/493900,1, Ein super dritter Teil der Dungeons-Reihe.   Die Singleplayerkampagne wieder einmal voller witziger Ideen und Dialoge.   W?r bereit f¨¹r mehr Kampagnencontent in Form von DLCs zu zahlen! Auf den Multiplayer k?nnt ich pers?nlich g?nzlich verzichten, aber wer es mag. :)  Absolut empfehlenswert. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/banana_joe/recommended/71230,1, Had it also on dreamcast back then. 100% achievements in roughly 10hours.    For me one of the funniest arcade-games i've ever played. I'm still looking for similar games on steam which just are good ol singleplayer-arcade-fun. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/banana_joe/recommended/351910,1, Bewertung der Early-Access-Version.  Kurz und knapp: Siedler2-Cultures-Mix im Wikingerstil mit zuf?llig-generierten Karten. Bedauerlicherweise gibt es kein siedelndes 'Feindvolk', man bek?mpft lediglich Feinde die auf dem Weg zum Ausgang der Map anzutreffen sind. Hoffentlich wird dies irgendwann noch nachgereicht (paid-DLC w?r imho i.O.).  Ansonsten absolute Kaufempfehlung. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/banana_joe/recommended/551170,1, Wenn ihr schon immer ein Spiel wie Summoners War f¨¹r den PC haben wolltet: Das ist es.  Und wenn man sich erstmal ein wenig durch das, zugegeben verwirrende, Userinterface gegraben hat, macht es ne ganze Menge Spa?. Kleiner ?berblick f¨¹r SW-Spieler:  Runes = Souls Mons = Shikigami Summoner = Onmyoji Kristalle = Jade Mana = Coins Energy = AP Arena Fights = Realm Raid Element-Dungeons = Auf Map unter Evo Materials zusammengefasst GB10 = Auf Map unter Souls zusammengefasst Nat5 = SSR ; Nat4 = SR ; Nat3 = R, Nat2 = N    Positive Abweichungen von SW:  - wesentlich mehr Koop-Content, quasi jedes Szenario und jeder Dungeon sind auch Koop spielbar - Dupe Nat5s k?nnen in Transzendenz-Scrollen gefused werden - Runeupgrade funktioniert indem man Crap-Runes hineinfeeded anstatt durch Mana/Coins - RTA findet in bestimmten Zeitfenstern statt ( = viele Spieler gleichzeitig online mit unterschiedlichsten Lvln) - man kann seine eigene Arena-Def tats?chlich performen sehen im Nachhinein!      Update August 2018:     Spiele inzwischen mehr Onmyoji als SW.   Die Bereitschaft der Entwickler neue Konzepte ins Spiel einzuf¨¹hren ist sehr gro?. Die Events werden auch immer mehr und SSR/Nat5 sind ziemlich gut farmbar.  Hat sich definitiv zu meinem ?berraschungshit 2018 entwickelt.  Kann es uneingeschr?nkt weiterempfehlen.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/skl_andrey/recommended/386540,1,  &quot;A.I. Invasion is an action-loaded top-down-shooter in a futuristic setting.&quot;  At the moment the game is in Early Access and the developers are working on it. You control a fleet of soldiers. Before a mission you are able to select what items you want to equip to each of these soldiers. The game throws you directly to lead a team, to either take care of intel or helping fellow allies on planets. You will get intel from the headquarters to either defend or eleminate A.I's that tries to destory everything that stands for humanity. For my review I used the mouse and the keyboard, controls are good but not the best. You have to press &quot;shift + the number of the command&quot; to give the order. The specific soldier can be picked before this by pressing the number of the soldier. You can select different items and abilities for the soldiers as well. These incude a fairly wide variety. The other thing you can select is strength of the armour. I don¡¯t see any advantages on putting a weaker armour onto a soldier.  The graphics are well polished, the levels are nicely designed so far and the futuristic atmosphere is well created. The game would be great with a co-op because the bot is a &quot;noob&quot;. It doesn't help you to much in a close combat with many enemies.  Pros:  It's funny to play it. Good graphics. Wide range of weapon types. Steam Achievements.  Cons: No co-op(yet).  Should you buy it? Yes, you should, the game is great, developers are working on it and it have a lot of updates with improvements.  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/skl_andrey/recommended/47920,-1, I can't even play it, game crashes after the play button.  I HAD TO FARM IT FOR 7 MINUTES, just to be able to write this review! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/skl_andrey/recommended/473560,1, First of all, I recommend this game, it's a great tower defense. The main idea of the game is to travel in space with the ship, and to defend yourself from the enemy ships. The music makes you to feel like you are playing an old school game, awesome soundtrack. You start with only one turret, you can't pass the first planet without doing some upgrades or buying some new defense guns, lasers, turrets, rocket launchers etc., and you need some skill, it's not that easy to hit all the enemy ships and win. The game has some tasks, when you finish the task you get a reward, like energy, money and aluminium so you can upgrade your weapons. It's addictive, you want to destroy more ships, to get more energy, to travel more, to reach the next planet. Main problem of the game now, it's that starting with the second half of planet two, the game become a bit unplayable, 5-10fps drops, but the dev is already working on that.  Per-total, it's a great game, addictive, and worth a shot. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/skl_andrey/recommended/229560,1,  Early Access review  I recommend this game because I know what is Hacker Evolution. If you never played HE before you should start with the first one, If you enjoy it, then you should come back here and play Immersion. The new console looks great. Although it has only one level at the moment, the dev is working daily to add new content. The first level gives you an overview of how to game will finally look and play.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/445020,1, The single player game mode is the new city mode, where factions vie for control and all are battling a common enemy. Money, earned by completing story-based missions or contracts for a faction, is used to purchase new units. Units are divided into squads that can roam around the city, and regenerate when killed. Missions take place inside (or adjacent to) procedurally-generated buildings that offer good variety in tactics. Some levels lack satellite coverage (hiding enemy movement) or contain locked windows or doors that must be opened in specific areas. The city game is a fun enhancement to the core gameplay, as the different alliances and mission types provide variety each play through. The tactical game has received improvements as well, starting with a large roster of new unit types (including riot shield, scoped rifle, knife, smoke and toxic grenades, mines, flamethrower, minigun, and turret). These new units open up more tactical possibilities in each game. Units can be instructed to focus on a certain portion of the map, and a ¡°focus diamond¡± can be played for increased accuracy. Large levels can be traversed in fewer turns using the ¡°long turn¡± option. Keeping units still, behind cover, and aiming in the correct direction still results in the best outcomes. The computer opponents are smart (most of the time) and provide good adversaries. Of course, online play is also available using simultaneous turn resolution and turns that can be submitted at your leisure. All of the previous game modes are available (extermination, charge, disputed, secure, hostage), plus quicker one-turn challenges. Frozen Synapse 2 has enough significant content through the robust city mode, vastly improved procedurally generated levels, and interesting new units to justify its existence.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSre1B_H3Og  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Psy0ch/recommended/627410,1, A quiet hard, weird looking, quierky game which makes you rage more then you want :P  The Controls dont get explained, you need them check it out yourself! The texts looking kinda cryptic - but this is what makes the style and tone of this game. Sound is ok, some could be improves - especially the saw sound from the levels... There are extra areas to explore like graveyards just to let you see more of the level.  Its a nice quick game to have, get it for something around 1,5 Euro if you can and want to try it out.  Warning: The Game crashes sometimes randomly it seems, it breaks the mood pretty hard...

https://steamcommunity.com/id/playa131/recommended/41700,1, One of the best game ever 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/nekomimibadik/recommended/816340,1, Despite 2 facts - that the previous games are much better, and that this one costs even more than 2 of those - i still do recommend this game and here is why:  1 - You don't have very much good Tower Defence games on steam and this one works very good. 2 - If you never played TD before - this prequel is good to start with because it's easier than it's ancestors. 3 - If we buy more Ironhide games here on PC - they will spend more time and bring us more high-quality content.  From the gaming point of view, this game offers good graphics, several hours of gameplay and pretty wide range of difficulty (from &quot;total noob&quot; to &quot;above average&quot;) 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Psy0ch/recommended/734920,1, Amazing Platformer with Puzzles, great music and charming graphics!  Give it a go!  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Psy0ch/recommended/534780,1, A interesting game indeed. A MMORPG (?) in which you fight as a Vehicle against other players or bots. Every Vehicle plays differently. It got missions to play if there are no people to play with and seems pretty plain. The floor,walls,sounds and generally the menu seem pretty EARLY ACCESS!, some levels dont even have graphics and are just plain black with white strips. The Idea of using &quot;skills&quot; in a fight seems like a neat feature and changes the way you play this game, even the bots use those on you.  Go and try this game out, the dev seems to work very closely with the community and this could be one of the better Early Access games :) 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/playa131/recommended/765730,1, I'm rarely post reviews for games. But it's been my first VR game, so I want to say a few words about that.  The graphics looks quite good, gameplay is interesting too, I've just played 1.5 hours but this is already enough to seem an interesting project.  The project in early access, but since the game was released just a week ago, so if there will be a few bugs, devs will be fix them immediately. They also always replying in community hub, so game have huge support from devs.  So I think everyone who have VR devices should try this. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/nekomimibadik/recommended/714240,1, Very nice, better version of the free Swarmriders - adds 3 classes and skill-casting - great party-game for some fun time on the counch.   Achievements are quite hard. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Psy0ch/recommended/734840,1, Simple enough Tower defense game with a minimalistic style.  You either love it or hate it.  It can get quite slow at times tho, so if there is just one last tanky enemie and you have your gunners/snipers... to widespread it could take a while... 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/playa131/recommended/617330,-1, What is it? No, really, what is it? The game takes place literally in 30 minutes, and achievements, drop out for anything. Going into the game, we understand that &quot;it&quot; positions itself as the first chapter, but on the store page there is not a word about it. In general, about this nowhere a word. The gameplay is clumsy and boring. Textures of enemies cause sadness and disappointment. And the dialogues are not afraid of this conclusion, they are written by children, maybe someone else is less. A lot of grammatical errors.  I do not want to see this in the Steam, I do not want to play it, I do not want it to be bought. Definitely a huge minus. Please do not buy this. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/playa131/recommended/336110,1, Well, I can say, the game is not noticeable, the usual shooter with a view from above, but with all that, he tightened on several good meat and bloody evenings. Personally, I really liked this game, although I'm not very familiar with this genre, the only acquaintance is naturally Alien Shooter, so there's really nothing to compare me with. Bloody Streets have two big minuses is character customization is completely absent. And the game doesn't have any story line. The game has a standard set of weapons, namely: two assault rifles, two shotguns, two pistols, and a machine gun. All this opens with the passage of the chapters, here their four. Each chapter has a certain number of cards in which we need to hold out three waves. I dare say that the cards are not boring, the enemy climbing from anywhere so you can't sit in one place, and you will be have to run.  Models of the enemies are very nice to see, especially when you killing the crowds of zombies, it looks very colorful. Of course, if it were not for achievements that are not difficult to knock out, I would probably spend here for an hour or two less. But still, the game was finished, and it was very entertaining to engage in achievement hunting.  So I think this game I can recommend for a couple of evenings.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Psy0ch/recommended/708940,1, Rebons is a game in which your character appearance (geometric figures) can change troughout the game with a click of a button. Your abilites depend on these! If you need to crawl up a wall you need to be a square, but if you want to quickly get from Point A to B you need to be a Circle.  The Levels make you switch alot, either to reach the goal or to collect diamonds, which you need to unlock more figures which have more power(s). Either you focus on points or on speed. This makes for a frustrating and extremly rewarding game in the end.  Besides that Rebons reminds your from the artstyle directly of Geometry Dash which is quite appealing.   The game puts alot of effort into the levels and replayability + coop. So if you can grab a friend and make a challenge out of it who is faster or simply jump into coop for a mess :P

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Psy0ch/recommended/682730,1,  PLAY THIS GAME WITH HEADPHONES! ??? ??? ???? ?? ????? ??? ???s? s???????   &quot;Hearing&quot; has a simple premise to it, it is a walking simulator in which you can close your eyes and enjoy the game.  The Game wants you to pick up 10   blue balls   which are placed all around a rather empty field inbetween rocks. Sadly there are barely ambient sounds, in a game which is called HEARING this is quite a let down, but it also helps to focus onto the objectiv. It can take a while till you get the balls together (dont worry, there are more then 10 so you can find this amount, else this would be tidious). While you are at it you explore the gameworld which doesnt look too bad, skybox is.. well a box. It doesnt move. But the trees and grass react to wind and you run around and find lost buildings, campfires which were left alone and   hidden characters .   Of cource the main gimmick is still hearing, so what about it? Well, to find the balls you need to listen to the sound of the game. These balls make a sound to find them in various places. Even tho the game promises that it could be played with your eyes closed.. you?d rather not.  As a fan of Dear Esther and various other genre-like games, its really hard to give this game a good or bad. I enjoyed the hunt, the idea and for a price of not even 1 Dollar - why not.  But also there a numerous bugs, it can take quite a while to get the balls and without a proper ambient sound it seems empty...  I give this game the benefit of a doubt and give it a Thumbs up, but be warned that It might not be the game you are looking for.   To see some small screenshots, check out mine =)   
https://steamcommunity.com/id/nekomimibadik/recommended/584400,1, It's fast, it's Sonic and it's just like old SEGA games, got it on sale with DLC and never regret it &lt;3  +Very nice work from the visual point of view- looks as good as it was 25 years ago &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 +Very nice controls no lag input no bugs etc - the only one problem is that game saves controls in a very strange way, when you restart the game, it's not always your last saved controls that are used - for example when i changed controls once - after restart i had default controls, and when i changed controls twice, after restart i had those controls that i set up 1st time ?\_(¥Ä)_/?) +Various game modes, various playable characters, unlockables and tons of gameplay hours.  Very cool, go buy it! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/nekomimibadik/recommended/361020,-1, Luxor, in general, is a nice game, back in the days it was one of the best time-wasters, but personally, I prefer Zuma or Atlantis any time any day soooo....  ANYWAY - best part of this game is that HD remake works in 2018 while OLD Luxor 3 simply doesn't work me.  It's a good time waster but for the current year, price tag and offered functionality (no steam achievements, lack of in-game diversity) I don't want to recommend this game, especially if you take into account that old games being sold on steam while not working :C

https://steamcommunity.com/id/nekomimibadik/recommended/851580,-1, Yet another Unity masterpiece - it's not a game but more of a functional demo:  -no in-game settings -the gameplay consists of randomly generated platforms with bonuses and spikes and sloppy controlled character packed with a double jump so you can &quot;play&quot; at all. -steam achievements but to get all of them you have to suffer a lot of time in this mess - not worth it.

Its so &quot;easy&quot; you might think, just press the direction and the letters at once but youre gonna fail - ALOT.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/PlatypusFlare/recommended/252950,1, Ich habe nie gedacht das mir so eine art &quot;Fu?ballspiel mit Autos&quot; so gut gef?llt. Es macht einfach nur spa? auch wenn man kein Fu?ballfan ist, (Es gibt nicht nur Fu?ball, sondern auch Eishocky, Dropshot, Rumble, Basketball) aber eine Sache ist manchmal ?rgerlich n?hmlich das Matchmaking. Man bekommt wenn man Meister ist z.B. einen Rocketeer rein.   Aber trotzdem ein gutes Spiel!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/888610,-1, The game features three short campaigns (11 scenarios total) at various difficulties, plus five sandbox maps; there are no random maps to extend the content. The goal is to make money by collecting resources, transporting those resources to factories to produce goods, then selling those goods. There are some multi-step production chains in the game (iron + oil &gt; plastic + steel + engine &gt; mower) that add complexity and require planning. However, it is extremely difficult to turn a profit early on in each campaign scenario (the sandbox maps have infinite money), as goods do not earn enough money to offset the expensive monthly maintenance costs for the factories and mines required to make those goods. Oligopoly is a potentially interesting economic strategy game with intricate production chains ruined by poor early game balance in the campaign mode.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lx6HjTjOfU  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/788700,1, The game features a campaign that consists of a series of semi-random scenarios where you must construct defenses and and army to fend off enemies that will appear after a set period of time; once you lose, you have to start over from the beginning so there is only one saved game slot. Workers are assigned to collect resources, construct buildings, make weapons, or constitute your army. Town size can be increased by building houses with wells nearby, and food must be produced every four turns to support your population. Random events, such as merchants that will trade resources for gold and monsters that attack before the end of the scenario, mix things up mid-game. Combat is performed in real-time, where units are given move and attack orders and use special abilities. Units will attack nearby enemies to reduce micromanagement. The AI is basic but only needs to be in a defensive game. Ultimately, ValeGuard is a game of resource management, assigning the correct number of workers to collect and produce the right goods in order to have enough troops and defenses to fend off the final attack. While the mechanics are somewhat repetitive, there is flexibility regarding which weapons and resources to focus on. Overall, ValeGuard is an enjoyable defensive strategy game with a management slant.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVnV-zqE-38

Astroneer  ¨¦ um game de sobreviv¨ºncia, explora??o e aventuras espaciais, ent?o prepare-se para armazenar bastante c¨¦lulas de Oxig¨ºnio e Energia. ? um jogo onde voc¨º pousa em um planeta sem ideia de onde voc¨º est¨¢, ou o que voc¨º pode encontrar.  Por ser um jogo de sobreviv¨ºncia, ¨¦ necess¨¢rio descobrir como as coisas s?o constru¨ªdas (crafting), os minerais que devem ser utilizados, as fun??es das maquinas... O jogo negligencia dizer-lhe coisas vitalmente importantes, espero que um tutorial seja implementado, com o desenvolvimento do jogo. Em  Astroneer  voc¨º n?o consegue sobreviver sem construir sua base e explorar novas tecnologias.    Durante a primeira meia hora foi enlouquecedor. Qual ¨¦ o objetivo? Para onde vou? Como eu chego l¨¢? E ent?o, quando eu n?o tinha nada mais para fazer, eu explorei - e ¨¦ a¨ª que o jogo se abriu para mim.  O design dos mundos em  Astroneer  s?o impressionantes; vegeta??o nunca vista, cavernas subterr?neas, colinas e vales que sugerem que os rios secaram h¨¢ bastante tempo.  As passagens Dia-Noite s?o lindas, e sempre reparem no c¨¦u estrelado, mas depois disso h¨¢ as tempestades. A primeira vez que uma tempestade aconteceu, eu pensei que era apenas um clima din?mico, e eu continuei com o meu importante trabalho explora??o de recursos. Na segunda vez fui atingido na cabe?a por um grande cubo, morri na hora. Assim, eu aprendi que as tempestades n?o s?o boas, e como dica: Esconda-se em um buraco (cavado por voc¨º mesmo) ou entre no seu Habitat.  ? um jogo que permite que voc¨º falhar, isso faz parte da descoberta! E mais uma dica para quando voc¨º morrer: Evite colocar minerais importantes na mochila, quando voc¨º morrer, eles n?o ir?o sumir, mas ser¨¢ trabalhoso voltar l¨¢ onde a mochila est¨¢ para recuper¨¢-los.  E Finalizando com mais uma dica, chame amigos para descobrir esse mundo  Astroneer .

Os Holobunnies, s?o animaizinhos do espa?o que tiveram sua casa destru¨ªda e est?o numa aventura procurando um novo lar. O foi dividido em dois jogos, por conta da sua campanha de financiamento no Kickstarter n?o ter sido bem sucedida. Ent?o os pequenos coelhos fizerem uma pequena pausa para promover disputas entre si enquanto o dinheiro ¨¦ coletado para dar continuidade ao desenvolvimento da ideia inicial. Holobunnies possui tr¨ºs mini games com jogabilidade simples e divertida, entretanto, em alguns casos a dificuldade ¨¦ aumentada. Os modos de jogar s?o: o modo brawler, o kitkat adventure e o modo de boss fights.  Em Brawler voc¨º enfrenta um amigo atrav¨¦s de conex?o local. Os est¨¢gios dispon¨ªveis permitir?o que os usu¨¢rios pulem de uma plataforma para a outra. E algumas coisas aparecer?o pelo caminho para perturbar a batalha, como armadilhas ambientais e outros pequenos elementos cl¨¢ssicos do g¨ºnero.  Kitcat Adventure ¨¦ o cl¨¢ssico jogo endless runner. Voc¨º dever¨¢ desviar de obst¨¢culos, inimigos e armadilhas de todos os tipos. H¨¢ uma boa variabilidade de mapas e trajetos para fazer com que voc¨º n?o se canse muito r¨¢pido.  Boss Fights ¨¦ um verdadeiro conjunto de desafios contra o chefe de todos os tipos. O jogador ter¨¢ que estudar os padr?es do inimigo e recorrer a uma contra-ataque eficaz. Encontramos um bom n¨ªvel de AI e os comportamentos de chefe que obriga o jogador a uma abordagem dificultada.  Cada se??o ¨¦ coberta pela presen?a de v¨¢rias op??es, a capacidade de escolher o n¨ªvel, as condi??es ambientais, paisagens e muito mais. Holobunnies: Pause Caf¨¦ tamb¨¦m oferece uma classifica??o na net, pode armazenar e publicar on-line seus pr¨®prios resultados, todos a fim de comparar os resultados com os de outros jogadores, ou seja, um  leaderboard .  O motor gr¨¢fico ¨¦ baseado no desenho retro, com personagens fofinhos e engra?ados, tudo nesse jogo foi bem pensado e interagem bem. Lembrando que a dublagem e trilha sonora do jogo s?o os pontos mais fortes. Holobunnies: Pause Caf¨¦ ¨¦ um t¨ªtulo despretensioso capaz de dar uma ideia de produto completo, divirta-se.

Rivais em Batalha  ¨¦ um jogo Multiplayer de tiro em terceira pessoa, que requer principalmente a coopera??o e trabalho em equipe. O jogo ¨¦ bem &quot;simpr?o&quot;, ¨¦ chegar, entrar na sala e meter bala nos enxergantes do oponente. Falando em oponente, voc¨º pode jogar com um rapos?o ou galinha de granja, acredito que mais Skins ir?o ser lan?adas, fica a dica para o desenvolvedor.  H¨¢ v¨¢rios modos de jogo, que podem ser disputados entre duas equipes de animais. O jogo apresenta, por hora, somente o modo Multiplayer, assim sendo necess¨¢rio uma certa quantidade de jogadores para animar as coisas. H¨¢ diferentes classes que voc¨º pode utilizar para combater seu inimigo, e outras que est?o indispon¨ªveis no momento.  O diferencial desse jogo ¨¦ que ele n?o tem as complexidades que outros games do mesmo g¨ºnero possui. Tamb¨¦m n?o poderia esquecer de comentar a dublagem PT/BR do jogo, deixa o jogo mais familiar, al¨¦m de ser engra?ado. S¨® lembro de ter visto dublagem semelhante no saudoso OUTLIVE, tamb¨¦m BR.  Entretanto ainda h¨¢ alguns bugs que precisam ser acertados, mas que n?o atrapalham a jogabilidade.

Na sua terra buc¨®lica de 8 Bits infiltrou-se o mal, e a popula??o foi incapaz de salvar-se. Nesta terra h¨¢ apenas algumas poucas pessoas para dar-lhe sugest?es e comandos do que fazer. Seus objetivos s?o derrotar um grupo de chefes, chegar a uma zona final, uma vez que voc¨º coletou todas as habilidades, e ao longo do caminho resolver os muitos, muitos quebra-cabe?as em seus 400 quartos interligados. ? muita coisa para se fazer em um game de 38.3 MB, n?o se engane!  Ent?o, at¨¦ agora esse jogo me pareceu um completo Metroidvania. Pois voc¨º re¨²ne habilidades, pode ser capaz de alcan?ar novas ¨¢reas anteriormente bloqueadas, e sempre/talvez expandir seu mapa. N?o ¨¦ a toa que fiquei perdido muito tempo, procurando estradas para seguir minhas ideias l¨®gicas dos jogos atuais.   Zoe tem uma espada m¨¢gica que serve para bater nos ossos dos inimigos. Mas com o tempo ela ganha a capacidade de criar um bloco verde - uma ferramenta usada de muitas maneiras para explorar melhor a ¨¢rea. Mais tarde, ela destranca a habilidade azul, amarelo e, por fim, a melhorias para as tr¨ºs. H¨¢ tamb¨¦m coisas misteriosas sobre o l¨ªquido azul e um frasco, que fornecem desafios b?nus para chegar a plataformas mais dif¨ªceis e ¨¢reas secretas. ? bom ir munido at¨¦ os dentes.  Uma grande frustra??o foi que Alwa's Awakening depende de pontos de salvamento. At¨¦ a¨ª tudo bem! mas voc¨º n?o conseguir¨¢ salvar itens que voc¨º conseguiu depois que de salvar pela ¨²ltima vez quando voc¨º respawn. E assim eu refiz meus percursos, for?adamente, at¨¦ conseguir passar pelas grandes dificuldades.  O resultado ¨¦ um exemplo realmente espl¨ºndido, com bastante id¨¦ias originais dentro do padr?o para torn¨¢-lo interessante. ? um jogo bom e s¨®lido, que ¨¤s vezes ¨¦ extremamente dif¨ªcil, mas n?o imposs¨ªvel. A arte pixel ¨¦ ador¨¢vel, os fundos s?o um pouco mon¨®tonos, mas as pequenas anima??es compensam isso. A velha guarda ir¨¢ se deliciar com a sua trilha sonora, aut¨ºntica para a era de 8 bits.

S¨® lembrando que erradicar todos os andantes ¨¦ praticamente imposs¨ªvel, mesmo com o limite de tempo que ¨¦ facilmente estendido.  Se voc¨º quiser atualizar seus ve¨ªculos para manter a competitividade em toda a carreira que voc¨º vai precisar localizar e recolher fichas de atualiza??o que est?o espalhados pelo mapa. E para aumentar a sua cole??o de ve¨ªculos, desbloqueando monstruosidades maiores e mais cru¨¦is, ¨¦ necess¨¢rio destruir qualquer um que se destaca em qualquer evento para reivindicar a posse.

Um presidi¨¢rio foi sentenciado a morar seus ¨²ltimos dias em uma esta??o espacial de propriedade de uma ag¨ºncia clandestina chamada Orbitek. O funcion¨¢rio, que ¨¦ voc¨º, deve realizar tarefas que foram enviadas pelos diretores da empresa. Voc¨º vai executar suas rotinas di¨¢rias e seguir as ordens de um diretor Orbitek dada atrav¨¦s de um intercomunicador, ou voc¨º vai desobedecer e buscar o seu pr¨®prio caminho para a liberdade? O jogo tem m¨²ltiplas termina??es e uma variedade de locais ex¨®ticos e furtivos.  Em primeiro lugar, ¨¦ recomend¨¢vel fazer um levantamento na nave espacial. Em seguida, comece a aceitar miss?es dadas pela Orbitek, no computador na ponte (com a grande janela onde voc¨º v¨º o planeta).  O jogo ¨¦ bastante misericordioso, se voc¨º n?o quer jogar a mesma miss?o ou fazer a mesma tarefa novamente, voc¨º pode cancel¨¢-lo a partir do computador principal. No entanto, se voc¨º fizer isso repetidamente, afetar¨¢ o seu desempenho de forma negativa aos olhos de Orbitek. Muitos n¨ªveis especiais de miss?o tem alguns elementos aleat¨®rios em cada jogo (voc¨º deve jogar o tempo suficiente para que a mesma miss?o especial ocorre duas vezes).  Algumas das tarefas consistem em simples manuten??o da nave no espa?o. De vez em quando, por¨¦m, voc¨º ¨¦ obrigado a realizar uma miss?o especial. Nestas, voc¨º ir¨¢ mergulhar no espa?o e em outra nave espacial, abandonada frequentemente para uma raz?es diversas.   Existem 18 diferentes miss?es, voc¨º n?o tem que esperar para que eles ocorrem aleatoriamente, pois isso levaria um tempo muito longo! Uma vez que voc¨º terminou o jogo 3 vezes (ou um fim espec¨ªfico), um bot?o especial no menu principal ir¨¢ desbloquear, o que lhe permite entrar em outras miss?es.  Sugest?es: Localiza??o em PT/BR Steam Trade Cards 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ramilos/recommended/347290,1,  Review powered by  Mamilos Club Group.    Rise  (a crian?a)  &amp; Shine  (a arma) s?o os protagonistas dessa hist¨®ria. Esse jogo ¨¦ um Run'n Gun, 2D nos moldes de Metal Slug que se passa em Gamearth, um planeta que j¨¢ foi colorido e cheio de vida, mas agora est¨¢ sendo invadido por seres malignos de outro planeta.  Seu aspecto audiovisual ¨¦ impec¨¢vel, pois cada leve, cada frame do jogo foi inteiramente desenhado a m?o. As anima??es suaves e coloridas s?o ador¨¢veis ??e de fundo de desktop digno, enquanto a trilha sonora ¨¦ melhor, com memor¨¢veis faixas orquestradas, ??incluindo vocais e piano. Avan?ar nesse jogo ¨¦ t?o prazeroso que voc¨º at¨¦ esquece que est¨¢ em um campo de batalha.  Al¨¦m disso ¨¦ um jogo lotado de refer¨ºncias ao mundo dos games, desde os mais antigos aos mais modernos.  Sua mec?nica ¨¦ incr¨ªvel, mistura a??o, plataforma e puzzles. Que requer jogabilidade r¨¢pida e precisa al¨¦m da sua capacidade de pensar. Com tr¨ºs op??es de disparo e v¨¢rios pare de tipos de bala emergentes do tambor de Shine, voc¨º precisar¨¢ aproveitar ao m¨¢ximo todas as op??es para completar os puzzles inteligentes que s?o encontrados no jogo, como exemplo, ¨¦ poss¨ªvel controlar a trajet¨®ria da bala, dar tiros de energia e at¨¦ lan?ar granadas juntamente com a bala.  Infelizmente o jogo ¨¦ muito curto, e esse ¨¦ o ¨²nico aspecto que ele deixa a desejar. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ramilos/recommended/390030,1,  Review powered by  Mamilos Club Group.   DESYNC ¨¦ um intenso jogo de a??o em primeira pessoa, e poder jogar ele ¨¦ como relembrar os antigos filmes futuristas da d¨¦cada de 90, cheio de raios Laser e m¨²sicas Disco, hoje podemos chamar isso de RETR?. Os primeiros minutos, ainda n?o sabia como inciar o jogo, os menus s?o integrados, ou seja, eles est?o dentro do jogo e voc¨º deve entender como eles funcionam. E para variar, FPS sempre me deixa ansioso, nervoso... e com medo de morrer para sempre.  Esse jogo faz tanta men??o as d¨¦cadas passadas que ao iniciar o jogo os gr¨¢ficos ficam oscilando, como se o monitor tivesse algum defeito... E se perceberem,  v¨¢rios jogos voltaram a este estilo est¨¦tico de nostalgia.  N?o h¨¢ nenhuma hist¨®ria por tr¨¢s de DESYNC, at¨¦ porqu¨º, nem todos os jogos precisam de uma narrativa. Em uma arena, apenas meta a bala em combos de rob?s inimigos para que consiga faz¨º-los em cacos de vidros espalhados pelo ch?o afim de obter uma excelente pontua??o e ter seu nome ranqueado no placar, e n?o esque?a do loot!  Voc¨º precisar¨¢ derrotar um Defensor de Zona para avan?ar para novas Zonas. Defensores de Zona empregam ataques que desafiam a sua compreens?o de sorte no azar.  No final de cada Zona, as informa??es de pontua??o s?o classificadas e alimentadas no sistema que identifica o seu estilo de jogo ao longo desse n¨ªvel, e qu?o eficaz e elegante voc¨º foi ao passar de n¨ªvel.  Infelizmente uma das defici¨ºncias de DESYNC ¨¦ que n?o h¨¢ nenhuma configura??o de dificuldade, ¨¦ apenas dif¨ªcil o tempo todo. Suporte a ideia de morrer v¨¢rias, v¨¢rias e v¨¢rias vezes e recome?ar de onde parou. A marreta vai lhe matar, fuja dela (Ir¨¢ lembrar disso ao jogar).  Se voc¨º joga bem, voc¨º e sua muni??o durar?o mais. Se voc¨º perder seus tiros ou estragar seus movimentos, suas armas se esgotar?o em segundos. Cada erro pode ser facilmente fatal.  DESYNC requer uma mistura especial de paci¨ºncia e precis?o, mostre ao mundo o melhor estilo de jogo, combina??o de armas e altas pontua??es.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/ramilos/recommended/324310,1,  Review powered by  Mamilos Club Group.   Sempre estamos procurando aprender coisas novas nos jogos, e t¨ªtulos com o nome simulador no meio as vezes pode ser complicado. O fato da quest?o ¨¦ que existem muito poucas experi¨ºncias de simula??o verdadeira. Simulador de cortar madeira, de demoli??o, de mec?nica de carros, todos esses jogos s?o vendidos com a ideia de lhe proporcionar uma experi¨ºncia da vida real. Voc¨º acha que Bus Simulator 16 atende aos requisitos?  Com Bus Simulator 16, voc¨º, o motorista de ?nibus ir¨¢ trabalhar na cidade de Sunny Springs! Dentro de um ?nibus MAN, projetado para Bus Simulator 16. Tanto no modo para um jogador quanto no modo multijogador, os jogadores n?o s¨® t¨ºm a chance de dirigir ?nibus p¨²blicos diferentes, mas tamb¨¦m podem criar e ajustar hor¨¢rios de ?nibus e gerenciar sua pr¨®pria empresa de transporte. Assim como na vida real, a pontualidade e a seguran?a dos passageiros ser?o, naturalmente, essenciais para o sucesso do jogador!  O sistema de reputa??o integrada tamb¨¦m leva em conta se o empres¨¢rio de ?nibus aspirante consegue dominar os controles dos ve¨ªculos, observa as regras de tr?nsito e toma a decis?o correta em in¨²meras situa??es di¨¢rias. Estas situa??es dos passageiros podem ser: demoram a chegar ao ponto de ?nibus, portas obstru¨ªdas ou locais de constru??o e engarrafamentos que devem ser evitados... Os jogadores tamb¨¦m estar?o vendendo bilhetes de passagem e no in¨ªcio isso foi bastante complicado, levei alguns minutos para entender como era o sistema de bilhete e de troco... o tutorial foi falho nesse quesito. Fora do ?nibus, tarefas de gerenciamento variadas, como a coordena??o de rotas de ?nibus, o planejamento eficiente de pessoal tamb¨¦m s?o parte essencial do neg¨®cio.  Algumas coisas s?o bem estranhas nesse jogo, por exemplo o dinheiro que se ganha em um dia inteiro de trabalho. O motorista leva cerca de 40 passageiros custando ¢ã 2,20 cada, de acordo com o jogo o total ¨¦ ¢ã 7.499, por¨¦m os meus c¨¢lculos mostram um valor bem modesto. A ideia de simulador ¨¦ proporcionar a experi¨ºncia da vida real! e neste ponto o jogo me deixa frustrado.  A f¨ªsica do jogo deveria ser melhorada... ¨¦ estranho dirigir um ?nibus lotado e n?o &quot;sentir&quot; ele pesado. Por outro lado devo destacar que os os ?nibus s?o possuem um painel com diversos bot?es e todos funcionais, isso deixa qualquer jogador feliz.  Talvez o jogo custa mais do que realmente vale... 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/GatlSantos/recommended/385800,1, I played this game sarcastically. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Alcohol_Fueled_Brewtality/recommended/378540,1, Pros:   - A return to Dark Souls 1-type of exploration. Relies less on connected smaller areas like Dark Souls 2 and 3 but instead you have a very large enviroment to explore in which you unlock shortcuts to make traversing it quicker as you go. I very much prefer this style, so it is a big plus.   - Enjoyable and meaty melee combat. I daresay it is even better than Dark Souls in some regards, especially when it comes to the bigger and heavier stuff which feel properly impactful and while still slow they flow a lot better than the Greatweapons of Dark Souls.   - Controls perfectly fine with mouse and keyboard. We all know how notoriously bad the Dark Souls-series is on this point, but The Surge definitely pulls it off flawlessly.   - Runs perfectly fine, even on my gaming laptop which is in the middle-ground between &quot;Minimum&quot; and &quot;Recommended&quot; specs.   - POISE! PRAISE THE SUN! The type of exo-skeleton rig you are wearing has stat akin to Poise in Dark Souls, only it actually matters - a lot! When you are wearing the lighter and more agile rigs, you are often sent flying into the air if you are unfortunate enough to get hit by an enemy with a heavy weapon. Wearing the beefiest rigs will not only reduce the damage taken, but keep your feet firmly planted on the ground!  Cons:   - No character creation whatsoever. Now this could be excused if the main character was written in such a way that his set of characteristics were central to the plot, but not as much. There is one spoilerific characteristic he has at the start of the game, but that could easily be given to anyone else. The role he plays could be filled by a myriad of different people.   - No online component whatsoever. Whether you loved it or hated it, the multiplayer aspect is a huge part of the Soulslike-experience and it is definitely noticable in it's absence.   - Retains the dumbest gimmick from Lords of The Fallen: You won't get the &quot;proper&quot; boss weapon unless you defeat the boss while meeting a specific condition. There is no way to know what that condition is in-game as you are fighting them,  forcing you to either spoil the game for yourself by Googling all the bosses and what to do or to miss out on the good version of their weapon. While there is NG+ to let you fight them again, the bosses can't be re-fought in your current NG.  Overall I'd still recommend the game because I feel the positives heavily, heaaavily outweights the negatives. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/806950,1, The game features three campaigns but two are initially locked. In addition, the first campaign contains a mandatory tutorial that cannot be skipped, even if it¡¯s not your first time playing. The campaign allows for free-form movement of fleets around the Pacific to achieve objectives but lacks a skirmish mode. Fleets can be instructed to attack, defend, move, recon, raid, or resupply. The game takes place in real-time and any conflicts can be skipped. ¡°War bonds¡± earned during missions can be used to purchase new ships, and experience points will unlock additional vessels. Tactical battles involve movement orders, speed adjustments, firing guns, and launching aircraft. Units will attack and maneuver automatically if issued general ¡°attack¡± commands, reducing micromanagement. Units can also be organized into squadrons that act as a single entity. Specific systems can be damaged during combat, and the AI provides decent opposition. Victory At Sea Pacific is a neat idea thanks to its persistent, non-linear campaign but lacks some ancillary features to fully round out the package.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQN4_Ec0QOI  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Alcohol_Fueled_Brewtality/recommended/816090,-1, It really pains me to leave a negative review on this. The art design and assets are top-notch and reeks W40K out of every orifice. Unfortunately the game itself isn't anywhere near as polished to the point of frustration.   - No dedicated servers. Matchmaker displays no ping or useful information whatsoever to tell you the quality of the host. Oh and if you disconnect, crash or the host leaves you lose all progress/rewards. Not a good combo.   - Class information is impossible to find unless you know exactly where to look. In fact there is only one screen that displays what the various class abilities actually do. What screen you ask? The in-game loadout. Yes, you actually have to start up a match if you want to read about the abilities! Furthermore this information is poorly displayed. You'd think you'd just see the class abilities and their icons and hover the mouse over them or something, right? No, they're hidden under some kind of awkward &quot;level up&quot; system.   - Rewards are given out in a Lootbox(TM) fashion. Of course, you don't have to buy them with money or anything but Lootboxes(TM) with a random reward for each level-up is a horrid way to hand out rewards even if you don't have to pay for it. I've not gotten a single useful thing for any of the classes I prefer. Woopee.   - No Single Player &quot;level replay system&quot;. The campaign features various collectibles and not being able to easily select and replay a beaten Chapter is asenine, quite frankly. You have to start the Campaign over entirely if you miss any of them since the game only has a few save slots and overwrites them with each new Chapter. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Alcohol_Fueled_Brewtality/recommended/649280,1, As of the patch on 24th of June the issues with the final boss has been resolved, and I can whole-heartedly recommend this DLC.   A love-letter to the old fans of the series it reintroduces the Helios Dreadnought, Premonition Carrier and Dreadnought-turned-Carrier Perun - the former two being available for purchase at Concordia HQ and the later being rewarded after beating the final boss of the reintroduced Bounty Hunting-mechanic. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ag00nY/recommended/452060,1,  Caveblazers ¨¦ um game rogue-like no estilo dungeon crawl , onde voc¨º ¨¦ um explorador em busca de... alguma coisa. Dizem as lendas que no final da caverna voc¨º encontrar¨¢ tudo que deseja, como todos os tipos de riquezas, j¨¢ outros dizem que n?o tem nada alem da morte. Nessa parte voc¨º entra para desvendar o que existe no final da dungeon e quais perigos e recompensas esperam voc¨º.  O plot do game ¨¦ basicamente isso, voc¨º ¨¦ mais um aventureiro em busca dos segredos da caverna, mas o que faz esse jogo ser diferente? Bom... O game tem muito conte¨²do se pararmos para analisar, mas todo esse conte¨²do ¨¦ liberado atrav¨¦s das suas v¨¢rias jogatinas, por que como todo rogue-like, voc¨º jogar¨¢ diversas vezes as mesmas runs para conseguir melhorias, que podem ser desbloqueadas no in¨ªcio do game, ou at¨¦ mesmo desbloquear outros modos de jogo.   Particularmente achei o game fant¨¢stico! Mas por que? Vamos aos pontos positivos e negativos e conversaremos melhor sobre eles...    Pr¨®s:    A fluidez da arte e das mec?nicas do jogo s?o excelentes, os comandos respondem com rapidez e precis?o, assim possibilitando jogadas delicadas e movimentos r¨¢pidos.    Bastante conte¨²do, muitas armas, inimigos, itens e possibilidades, divertid¨ªssimo!    O jogo lan?o tem um tempinho, mas ainda ¨¦ atualizado.    O game tem tudo que voc¨º precisa... Conquistas, Cartas, Suporte a controle, Multiplayer, e n?o ¨¦ caro.    Modos de jogos adicionais, como Arena e Daily Run.    O jogo ¨¦ desafiador, para quem n?o gosta de games f¨¢ceis, ¨¦ uma boa pedida.    Contras:    O Multiplayer citado acima ¨¦ apenas LOCAL, ent?o voc¨º precisa ter amigos ai na sua casa, e pelo menos um ou dois controles.    Alguns inimigos s?o meio apel?es de mais, mas voc¨º consegue counterar a maioria aprendendo seus padr?es.    N?o sei :v   Fiz um v¨ªdeo das minhas primeiras impress?es sobre o game, se caso algu¨¦m quiser ver alguma gameplay, ¨¦ nesse v¨ªdeo que voc¨º vai. Also... Recomendo pacas o game!

https://steamcommunity.com/id/jimraynor/recommended/351230,1, Counter Spell ist eine interessante und kurzweilige Mischung aus Egoshooter (FPS) und Rollenspiel (RPG) und ein Geheimtipp f¨¹r Fans von Indie-Spielen.  Vom Spielgef¨¹hl spielt sich das Spiel wie ein FPS, wird jedoch um diverse klassische Elemente eines RPG erg?nzt. Es gibt verschiedene Klassen mit unterschiedlichen F?higkeiten, Levelaufstiege, Skillpunkte und man sammelt immer bessere Ausr¨¹stung, die den Charakter noch st?rker macht. Vergleichbar ist das Spiel grob mit Hexen 2 und dem etwas neueren Dark Messiah of Might and Magic.  Counter Spell verf¨¹gt ¨¹ber diverse Spielmodi. Der Questmodus ist die typische Singleplayerkampagne, bei der man die ganze Welt nach und nach erkundet. Das Spiel ist Open World, sprich man ist lediglich durch die Gegnerst?rke in seinem Vorgehen limitiert. Die Story hierbei ist eher rudiment?r, jedoch kann man mehrere B¨¹cher in der Welt finden, die die Hintergrundgeschichte recht am¨¹sant etwas vertiefen und ausf¨¹hren. Man kann die Kampagne auch Coop mit Freunden spielen. Sie dient jedoch haupts?chlich dazu, mit der Welt, den Gegner und F?higkeiten seines Charakters vertraut zu werden und dauert etwa 5 Stunden.  Anschlie?end kann man entweder dort weiter bessere Items f¨¹r seinen Charakter farmen, einen h?heren Schwierigkeitsgrad versuchen (es gibt 3), die anderen Klassen ausprobieren oder sich in einem der anderen 9 Spielmodi mit Freunden austoben. Diese sind wahlweise auf einen Sektor der Welt begrenzt oder nutzen die gesamte Weltkarte. Man hat die Wahl zwischen klassischen PVP-Modi wie Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Kingslayer, die auch teilweise interessante Abweichungen und Variationen zu den bekannten Modi bieten oder mehreren Coop-Modi mit Freunden wie das klassische Survival. In den PvP-Modi k?nnen Itemvorteile auf Wunsch deaktiviert werden, um faire Matches zu garantieren. In den Coop-Modi kann man dagegen auch bessere Ausr¨¹stung f¨¹r seinen Charakter finden.  Das Spiel liefert auch einen umfangreichen Baumodus, bei dem man wie in Minecraft eigene Karten bauen kann. Wer sich gerne kreativ austobt, kann hier mehrere Stunden verbringen.  Besonders hervorzuheben ist die herausragende Pflege des Spiels durch den Entwickler. Es gibt regelm??ige Patches mit neuen Inhalten und Bugfixes und auf Fragen oder Vorschl?ge im Forum wird innerhalb weniger Stunden reagiert. Das Spiel wird also st?ndig weiterentwickelt und verbessert, wodurch man alle paar Monate wieder reingucken kann und interessante Neuerungen findet.  Solospielzeit: 5-20 Stunden Multiplayerspielzeit: 1-20 Stunden  + Abwechslungsreiche Klassen + Unverbrauchtes und neues Spielgef¨¹hl + Sehr aktiver Entwickler, h?ufige Updates und sehr schnelle Antworten und Reaktionen im Forum + Viele spa?ige Spielmodi  +/- Der Grafikstil ist sicherlich Geschmackssache, jedoch in sich sehr sch?n und absolut stimmig  - Wenig aktive Spieler, wer Multiplayermodi spielen m?chte, sollte ein paar Freunde mitbringen. Es gibt zwar regelm??¨ªge Multiplayertreffen im Forum organisiert, jedoch aus den USA, sodass sie in Deutschland nur Nachts zwischen 2-4 Uhr stattfinden - Rudiment?re Story, wer auf eine gute Story Wert legt, wird eher entt?uscht   Fazit: Wer Indie-Spiele sowie den Grafikstil mag und gerne etwas neues ausprobiert, sollte sich Counter Spell unbedingt anschauen. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ag00nY/recommended/440900,-1,  *Suspiro* Ta... Vamos l¨¢!   Vou comparar muita coisa aqui com ARK, porque ARK ¨¦ o game que mais joguei na minha steam at¨¦ ent?o, e acredito ser um bom concorrente para comparar, ambos s?o parecidos em muitos aspectos, g¨ºneros e afins...   O game tem a mesma pegada que outros games de survival meio MMO, com servidores grandes e muita gente. Mas aqui n?o tem muita gente, m¨¢ximo em servidores oficiais ¨¦ 40 pessoas, o que acho pouco pelo tamanho do mapa, n?o estou dizendo que o mapa ¨¦ grande, ele ¨¦ OK... Mas 40 pessoas ¨¦ pouco para esse tamanho, eu faria algo por volta de 60 pessoas. O game se passa no mundo de conan como o pr¨®prio nome do game diz, eu particularmente gostei da ambienta??o, contendo v¨¢rios biomas e talz, mas como n?o sou f? de desertos que ¨¦ o que mais tem, ainda achei meio m3rda. Mas claro, isso ¨¦ opini?o pr¨®pria. O game tamb¨¦m tem nudez total, n?o sei se vale a pena citar isso aqui, mas tem... da para ver peitos, pepecas e peroquitas balangando :P   No game voc¨º pode fazer tudo como em todo survival, como:  Construir sua base, comer, beber, frio, calor, upar de lv, aprender novas constru??es, distribuir pontos de stats, fazer armas e armaduras, lutar contra bosses, lutar contra outros players em pvp, ou n?o em pve, tribos, etc... etc...  Uma parada que gostei no game sobre os modos, ¨¦ o  PVE Conflict , que ¨¦ um PVP com limita??es, voc¨º pode atacar outros jogadores, mas n?o pode destruir suas constru??es se caso ele for um player ativo, isso acaba totalmente com aquela porcaria de problema que eu passei muitas vezes no ARK, onde voc¨º da sua vida pra construir uma base top, tamar dinos e afins, para ir dormir e no outro dia acordar, logar e estar tudo destru¨ªdo...   Bom vamos logo a uma listinha geral do que ¨¦ legal e do que ¨¦ n?o ¨¦.   ? O game ¨¦ legal?  Sim!... Mas garanto que poderia ser muito melhor.   ? Como s?o s?o os servidores?  Uma Droga, tem poucos servidores no SA, e todos eles mesmo dizendo l¨¢ 30ms de ping, s?o extremamente lagados, eu passaria longe dos PVP, voc¨º n?o vai conseguir uma combate decente, vai ser um combate de quem laga mais rsrs   ? Ele tem modo singleplayer?  Tem! E nesse n?o ¨¦ lagado, ¨¦ 100% liso, por ser local e n?o online, mas ¨¦ singleplayer, seu amigo n?o vai conseguir dar join, se voc¨º quer fazer um server para seu amigo, procure alguns tutoriais de como setar um server dedicado, mas acredito que n?o v¨¢ valer o esfor?o.   ? O game ¨¦ bem otimizado?  N?o sei bem como anda o ARK atualmente, por que eu jogava em 2015, e naquela ¨¦poca era um po?o de m¨¢ otimiza??o. Tamb¨¦m n?o direi que o Conan ¨¦ super bem otimizado, mas comparando com ARK, ¨¦ muito melhor.   ? O que voc¨º mais gostou do game?  Talvez o mundo de conan como foco, as criaturas e talz, achei bem legal esse tema. Gostei do modo PVE Conflict, n?o sei se existe um modo assim no ARK hoje em dia, mas ¨¦ algo que salva sanidades. Tem um sistema de NPC's que voc¨º pode ter para trabalharem para voc¨º, tamb¨¦m achei interessante. Escalar as paredes e algumas features de combate tamb¨¦m s?o legais, pena que o lag n?o deixa usar o sistema de combate direito.   ? O que voc¨º n?o gostou no game?  Todo o resto? kkkk Servidores super lagados, jogo tem MUITOS BUGS! MUUUUUUUITOS BUGS!!!! S¨¦rio, ¨¦ muito desanimador jogar um game que deveria estar em early acess, ainda parar pra ver o pre?o que cobram nisso, sabendo que existe ARK como concorrente que eu sei muito bem que ¨¦ 200x melhor! S¨¦rio, tudo no game desanima muito a quantidade de bugs e lag para tudo ¨¦ imensa, de verdade! NPC's voando, coisas sumindo ou aparecendo do nada, bichos deslizando e teleportando, game crashando e por ai vai...   ? Ent?o, vale a pena comprar? Recomenda?  N?o e n?o! N?o vale a pena comprar e muito menos recomendo, prefiro que voc¨ºs optem por ARK ou algum outro concorrente como RUST [eu nunca joguei rust, mas deve ser mais legal, sla kkk] Nem em uma promo??o! a menos que seja tipo... 10 reais kkkk E por que eu comprei o game ent?o? Eu n?o comprei, veio no Humble Mountly desse m¨ºs de Julho, ent?o eu n?o escolho XD   Eu esperava muito mais do game, mas me decepcionei feio =/ Eu s¨® continuo jogando, por que como falei acima, ¨¦ legal, mas isso por que estou em server FULL PVE, e mesmo assim me incomodo com muitos problemas do game, mas quero explorar ele mais, ver tudo que ele pode me oferecer, ver as futuras updates enquanto eu tiver no ?nimo do game, se caso eu come?ar a ver ele de outra forma, ou os devs melhorarem o game com futuras updates, eu posso mudar essa an¨¢lise, por agora ¨¦ isso...  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/703880,1, The game features a story-based campaign mode, online play, and custom games against the AI or a local opponent. The three factions provide a good mix of units and spells, or you can create a custom faction using any item combination. Gold (collected by workers from mines, or from blocks scattered around the map) is used to unlock and purchase new units and buildings, while mana (collected differently for each faction, but also in block form) is used to cast spells. Units automatically move across the map and attack, so the timing of unit production (making sure a mass of units arrive at the enemy base at the same time) and proper use of spells to support an attack determines the victor. The game is very approachable but still allows for strategic variety (which units to unlock, when to attack, save up or spend, focus on defensive structure or more units). Swords and Soldiers 2 Shawarmageddon, like the original game, widens the appeal of the real-time strategy game by offering a fast, action-packed title that¡¯s easy to learn.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfQ5E_54Q24  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ag00nY/recommended/588650,1,  Dead Cells ¨¦ sem d¨²vida um dos meus roguelikes favoritos!   O jogo 2d pixelizado de plataforma sem duvida surpreende em muita coisa!  O game contem uma abrangente de conte¨²do bem gorda, desde armas, equipamentos e magias, voc¨º passa por v¨¢rios biomas diferente podendo escolhe por onde voc¨º quer avan?ar primeiro, geralmente cada fase, te da escolha a dois caminhos, e cada caminho tem algo ¨²nico, como inimigos, formas de percorrer pelo mapa, secrets e at¨¦ habilidades passivas permanentes que voc¨º consegue coletar para seu personagem.  O jogo ¨¦ daqueles que quando voc¨º morre, renasce e perde tudo que conseguiu na sua jogatina anterior... bom, nem tudo. voc¨º coleta C¨¦lulas conforme vai jogando, e pode trocar essas c¨¦lulas em melhorias permanentes e principalmente desbloquear projetos de armas e habilidades que voc¨º encontra pelo jogo, cada inimigo, cada fase, cada peda?o do game, te dropa projetos diferentes, sendo assim voc¨º precisa explorar o game como um todo para desbloquear tudo que ele pode oferecer, e coloca muita coisa nisso, existem mesmo muitas coisas para desbloquear, cada uma com seus stats e passivos ¨²nicos, voc¨º pode adaptar uma forma de jogar diferente para cada jogatina, combinando armas e habilidades para fazer diferentes builds e encaixar melhor no seu plano de jogo.   O Game tem sua jogabilidade e gr¨¢ficos muito legais.  O estilo 2D dele pixelizado ¨¦ muito bem feito, cada detalhe, movimento ¨¦ tudo muito bem trabalhado, ¨¦ um estilo gr¨¢fico que sempre fui f?, e posso dizer que adorei a forma que Dead Cells foi feito. O mesmo vale para a jogabilidade... Se voc¨º ¨¦ um player que costuma jogar esse tipo de jogo de forma mais hardcore, ou rushando, vai adorar sua jogabilidade! Os comandos respondem r¨¢pido e com perfei??o, possibilitando voc¨º fazer v¨¢rias jogadas r¨¢pidas e ¨®timas esquivas sem ficar travando em coisas ou ver que o boneco parece que n?o quer fazer nada do que voc¨º clica. Jogabilidade nota 1000!   Falando sobre o pre?o...  N?o acho ele caro para o que ele te entrega, ¨¦ um game que foi muito bem feito em todos os aspectos, e inclusive foi atualizado recentemente(olhar data da an¨¢lise) Ent?o abandonado ¨¦ uma coisa que o game n?o esta. Com promo??o ou sem promo??o, o game vale cada centavo do que ele custa, voc¨º sem d¨²vida n?o vai se arrepender de ter gastado seu dinheiro nessa linda obra prima. Claro... se voc¨º for f? desse g¨ºnero de game.  Inclusive o game conta com coquistas (que s?o complicadas de pegar, at¨¦ por que o foco do game ¨¦ ser dif¨ªcil) Contem cartas steam e compatibilidade total com controle (que ¨¦ 100% necess¨¢rio para jogar esse game com maestria)   SUPER RECOMENDADO!  Ta aqui um v¨ªdeo que fiz do game, ¨¦ bem antigo e foi a primeira vez que eu joguei, ent?o mehh...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2wyc8cOyaI  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ag00nY/recommended/684410,1, Em Bridge Constructor Portal voc¨º ¨¦ um novo funcion¨¢rio da Aperture Science que deve seguir as ordens de GLaDOS para subir na carreira e n?o ser despedido.  Morto de forma horr¨ªvel    O game segue a mesma jogabilidade de tooooooooooda franquia de games &quot;Bridge Constructor&quot; Que para quem ainda desconhece, ¨¦ focado em puzzles onde seu objetivo principal ¨¦ construir pontes que ir?o possibilitar os carrinhos passarem de um lado ao outro do cen¨¢rio sem dar grandes problemas. ? um game super casual sem grande foco em hist¨®ria, mais em jogabilidade, ele tende a ser um game que voc¨º abre depois de um dia estressante para dar uma relaxa e n?o se incomodar com muitos problemas  (talvez)    O diferencial desse game da s¨¦rie Bridge Constructor, ¨¦ que ele une tudo que ah de bom em Bridge Constructor e tudo que ah de bom na saga Portal em um jogo s¨®.  A tematiza??o e as caracter¨ªsticas de ambos os games unidos ¨¦ PERFEITA!     Vamos aos pr¨®s e contras?    Pr¨®s: ? Muito fiel a Portal ? Jogabilidade cl¨¢ssica do bridge constructor, mas modificada ao estilo portal ? Bem otimizado ? Bonito ? PT-BR ? GlaDOS tem frases engra?adas, o game tem uma boa pitada c?mica ? Possui Conquistas ? Entrega tudo que promete ? Possui cartas   Contras ? ? o mais caro da franquia, mas tamb¨¦m ¨¦ o mais novo   O game tem toneladas de pontos positivos a mais do que qualquer ponto negativo!  Mas entendam que eu n?o estou dizendo que esse ¨¦ o game mais??????do ano, GOTY... n?o! Eu apenas estou dizendo que o game entrega tudo que ele promete, com perfei??o, o game entrega ao usu¨¢rio o que o game quer ser. Mas tamb¨¦m n?o estou dizendo que o game ¨¦ fraco, ¨¦ muito legal!   Para entender melhor, eu gravei um trecho da minha live stream e postei no youtube, quem quiser dar uma aprofundada:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuvspDINsSw&amp;t=456s    Recomendo fortemente para f?s de portal e da s¨¦rie de jogos bridge constructor!   EDIT   ? FOI ADICIONADO CARTAS DIA 16 DE ABRIL, PONTO POSITIVO! :)

Ent?o... Esse game aqui tentou embarcar no mesmo barco das modinhas, assim como saem 200 tipos de battleroyals por dia, ou na ¨¦poca que games de sobreviv¨ºncia eram famosos, como dayZ tmb saiam toneladas de games imita??es. Esse game aqui n?o deixa de ser a mesma coisa, s¨® que pior XD   Comparando com seus concorrentes, ele apenas ganha no quesito gr¨¢fico, e mesmo assim ainda peca nisso por ser muito mal otimizado.  O game n?o possui multiplayer online, n?o possui oficina Steam, n?o possui boa otimiza??o, a gravidade da bola ¨¦ muito ruim, parece que passaram sab?o em baixo da bolinha e por ai vai... Mesmo que ele tenha esse pre?o reduzido, eu n?o consigo recomendar ele, at¨¦ por que com um pouquinho a mais na carteira voc¨º j¨¢ compra um dos seus concorrentes que ¨¦ 100x melhor.  Acho que se eles querem tentar competir com alguma coisa que esta na moda, eles precisam criar algo diferente em cima da moda, dar uma diversificada para poder ter seu destaque, e n?o fazer o que foi feito nesse jogo.   Pelo menos o game ¨¦ legalzinho de jogar, voc¨º at¨¦ se diverte, mas infelizmente existe a concorr¨ºncia, e ela ganha em peso.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/jimraynor/recommended/290790,1, Grey Goo ist ein klassisches old-school Echtzeitstrategiespiel. Es orientiert sich haupts?chlich an den ersten Command &amp; Conquer-Teilen, der Entwickler Petroglyph besteht aus vielen ex-Westwood-Mitarbeitern, auch wenn es optisch eher an StarCraft erinnert. Es spielt sich jedoch deutlich langsamer als StarCraft und erfordert kaum Micromanagement (die Einheiten haben keine Spezialf?higkeiten) sondern konzentriert sich auf Macromanagement (Einheitenzahl und -zusammensetzung sowie Basisbau an sich).  In Grey Goo gibt es drei Fraktionen, die Menschen, Beta und Goo. W?hrend sich Menschen und Beta bei den Einheiten sehr ?hneln und fast gespiegelt sind, unterscheidet sich der Basisbau bei beiden grunds?tzlich. Die Goo sind v?llig einmalig, da sie weder ¨¹ber Basenbau verf¨¹gen und sich auch bei den Einheiten extrem unterscheiden.  Die Kampagne bietet pro Fraktion 5 Missionen und erz?hlt eine zusammenh?ngende Geschichte, in der man erst Beta, dann Menschen und abschlie?end Goo spielt. Die Geschichte wird durch herausragende CGI-Filme erz?hlt, die selbst Blizzard Konkurrenz machen, sowie kurzen Missionsbriefings mit animierten Charakteren und Meldungen in den Missionen. Durch den kostenpflichtigen DLC wird die Kampagne um 3 weitere Missionen erg?nzt, 1 f¨¹r die Menschen und 2 f¨¹r die Goo, und die Story des Hauptspiels erg?nzt. Trotz der herausragenden CGI-Filme gewinnt die Story zwar keinen Oscar, ist jedoch ordentlich und interessant umgesetzt, wenn auch etwas klischeebeladen. Man ben?tigt etwa 10-15 Stunden, um die Kampagne durchzuspielen.  Die Grafik von Grey Goo setzt keine neuen Meilensteine, ist aber sch?n und ansprechend umgesetzt, jedoch ?hneln sich die Einheiten teilweise zu sehr bzw. sind nur schwer zu unterscheiden, sodass man nicht immer alles auf den ersten Blick erkennt. Die musikalische Untermalung ist jedoch ¨¹ber jeden Zweifel erhaben und geh?rt mit zu dem Besten, was man im Strategiegenre zu h?ren bekommt. Komponist ist Frank Klepacki, der bereits den Soundtrack zu den ersten Command &amp; Conquers komponierte, wie dem Hell March.  Der Multiplayermodus bietet die bekannten Modi 1v1, 2v2 (jeweils ranked oder unranked), FFA oder Spiele gegen die KI. Die KI verf¨¹gt ¨¹ber mehrere Schwierigkeitsgrade (mit oder ohne cheaten) sowie Pers?nlichkeiten (Bunkern, Rushen, etc) und kann den pers?nlichen Vorlieben angepasst werden. Er ist jedoch leider auf 4 Spieler begrenzt, wodurch keine gr??eren Spiele m?glich sind. Die Fraktionen sind gr??tenteils ausbalanciert, man muss jedoch die Taktiken gegen die jeweiligen Fraktionen sowie f¨¹r einen guten Spieleinstieg kennen, um nicht v?llig unterzugehen. Grey Goo bietet jedoch die Option an, sich beliebige Replays angucken zu k?nnen, sodass man sich die Taktiken schnell und einfach von den Profis abgucken kann. Leider ist jedoch im Multiplayermodus nicht mehr allzuviel los. Haupts?chlich findet man 1v1-Ranked-Spiele, 2v2 wird kaum noch gespielt. Auf Grund der kleinen Spielerbasis findet man auch h?ufig die selben Gegner im 1v1, wodurch die Lernkurve am Anfang doch recht steil und frustrierend ist, wenn man sich keine Replays anguckt. Der Multiplayerpart wird jedoch weiterhin von den Entwicklern mit Turnieren am Leben gehalten und etwas gepushed sowie promoted, wodurch durchaus noch regelm??ig neue Spieler hinzukommen oder es kleinere Spitzen an Spielern gibt, jedoch auf einem vergleichsweise niedrigem Niveau.   Solospielzeit: etwa 10-15 Stunden Multiplayerspielzeit: 1-20 Stunden  + Klassisches Echtzeitstrategiespiel mit Basenbau + gute und abwechslungsreiche Kampagne + 3 Fraktionen mit unterschiedlicher Spielweise + Herausragende Zwischensequenzen + Hervorragender Soundtrack  +/- Einheitenauswahl ist etwas begrenzt, jedoch ausreichend  - Einheiten teilweise zu ?hnlich bzw. nur schwer unterscheidbar - Multiplayermatches auf 4 Spieler begrenzt und nur noch wenige Spieler    Fazit: Das Spiel richtet sich ganz klar an Fans der klassischen Echtzeitstrategiespiele, die mit einem Kauf nicht viel verkehrt machen k?nnen, wenn sie es prim?r f¨¹r den Singleplayerpart kaufen. Wer moderne Strategiespiele bevorzugt oder grundlegende Neuerungen im Genre erwartet, wird von Grey Goo eher entt?uscht werden. Die Erweiterung erg?nzt das Spiel um ein paar Missionen und f¨¹hrt es einem runden Ende zu.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ag00nY/recommended/657200,-1, Achei os comandos bem merdas. O game me irrita mais que uma partida perdida de 1 hora e meio no LoL XD  S¨¦rio, depois eu fa?o uma an¨¢lise melhor, ¨¦ que eu me irritei de mais por enquanto :3 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/600480,1, The game features a campaign mode with scenarios that include varied starting and victory conditions; also included is a flexible sandbox mode. The goal is to expand the aquarium by placing new tanks filled with fish and other aquatic creatures; each animal has different attributes and desires (such as water temperature, grass, or caves) that must be balanced in each ecosystem. Different machines, such as filters, skimmers, heaters, and lights, can be attached to tanks to achieve the levels required by its inhabitants. Staff members will automatically feed the fish, repair broken equipment, and keep the aquarium clean. Money is earned by having popular animals on display and by selling food, drinks, and souvenirs. Animals also provide research points used to unlock new animals and equipment. The game is very approachable while still requiring some careful balancing so animal needs don¡¯t interfere. While the game can get repetitive and there is some waiting for new things to finish researching, the variety of animals and freeform expansion options buoy interest. Megaquarium is a well-executed management game.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsvBdHzXduI  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ag00nY/recommended/718320,-1, FoxyLand ¨¦ um game de plataforma onde voc¨º precisa resgatar sua namorada, e para isso deve ir passar pelos variados desafios que cada um dos 27 cen¨¢rios te possibilita, coletando cerejas(dinheiro) e diamantes(chaves para o pr¨®ximo cen¨¢rio)  N?o tem muito o que falar do game, vamos direto ao que interessa ent?o...  Vale a pena?  A resposta ¨¦, se voc¨º ganhou de gra?a sim XD  Mesmo que o game seja  Barato,  n?o quer dizer que ¨¦ bom... Ele ¨¦ bem simples, tem nada de mais,  e na minha opini?o tem mais pontos negativos do que positivos,  e nem para ter cartas :c  Os comandos s?o zuados, a c?mera se meche de forma horr¨ªvel, e os pixels de colis?o n?o fazem sentido! Tem hora que voc¨º atravessa seu corpo por dentro do objetivo e n?o morre, e tem vezes q nem de encostar a pontinha do rabo e voc¨º j¨¢ esta morto...  As cerejas que citei acima, s?o dinheiro do game, elas servem para voc¨º comprar um passe livre para o pr¨®ximo cen¨¢rio, se caso n?o consegue passar o atual(inclusive achei caro) E tamb¨¦m para comprar cosm¨¦ticos na lojinha do game, que n?o servem para nada alem de mudar um pouco seu personagem.   Curiosidade Quando eu recebi o game da desenvolvedora para an¨¢lise, ele ainda estava em  early acess,  At¨¦ ai tudo bem... Mas eu andei testando ele recentemente, e percebi que os devs retiraram ele do early, no caso, j¨¢ passou da vers?o 1.0, inclusive est?o adicionando at¨¦ um modo novo multiplayer, really? Gente... antes de tirar um game da beta, e de come?ar a criar modos novos... TERMINEI o game base! Esta muito bugado pra estar deixando a base do game de lado, e para estar tirando de beta!  E tem algum  Ponto Positivo?  Tem... Alem do pre?o, mas mehh... A arte do game confesso que gostei muito, o estilo de pixel 2D dele eu particularmente achei muito fofo e bem feito, mas a programa??o... socorro!   Para entender melhor, eu gravei minha live onde testei o game, para quem quiser se aprofundar mais.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMPLx80JCyY&amp;t=1429s   Mas fielmente  n?o recomendo,  at¨¦ mesmo se estiver muito barato, pelo simples fato de n?o possuir cartas :P 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ag00nY/recommended/317400,1,  Caraca, se for para elogiar um mod, ¨¦ esse aqui! O game est¨¢ fant¨¢stico, at¨¦ convence f¨¢cil ser um novo game original do portal, algo feito pela valve, mas n?o ¨¦! XD  Portal Stories: MEL conta uma hist¨®ria paralela que deu a entender que se passa momentos antes do portal original. Existia at¨¦ outro robo chefe em vez da Glados, n?o entrarei em tantos detalhes por causa da spoiler, mas se caso falei alguma???????me corrijam ai nos comments :)  Achei o game mais d¨ªficil que os games portal originais, puzzles muito bons, para quem gosta sem d¨²vida recomendo fortemente dar uma olhada nesse mod. Cenariza??o super bem feita, game original com uma portal gun diferenciada, uma protagonista diferenciada, tudo diferenciado!!! Inclusive totalmente narrado, sem d¨²vida uma obra prima dos mods, paguei muito P@u para esse belezinha!  O game at¨¦ que ¨¦ longo se considerar que ¨¦ um mod, at¨¦ pelo fato dos puzzles serem mais complicadinhos. E... ? isso ai, n?o tem muito o que falar de um game como portal, o mais importante j¨¢ citei, e repito novamente... JOGUEM!   Super recomendado!    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbGOiXGfyB0

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ag00nY/recommended/471710,1,  Rec Room ¨¦ um game social com foco no gameplay casual, claro que... Se voc¨º quiser jogar ele de forma mais hardcore nos mini-jogos PVP voc¨º pode, mas certamente eu n?o recomendo, o neg¨®cio aqui ¨¦ se divertir e dar boas risadas.   Feito para VR, mas ainda assim podendo ser jogado em flat no seu pc com teclado e mouse(que tamb¨¦m recomendo, ¨¦ bem divertido)   Rec Room tem uma pegada mais como um  &quot;final de semana com amigos&quot;  onde o neg¨®cio ¨¦ se divertir, mas nem por isso ¨¦ um game relativamente f¨¢cil, ainda mais que boa fatia dos seus mini-games s?o PVP, mas n?o deixe a palavra &quot;PVP&quot; te assustar, a comunidade ¨¦ longe de ser t¨®xica.   Pelo menos eu nunca encontrei um cuz?o por l¨¢, talvez por que Am¨¦rica do sul n?o tenha VR t?o acess¨ªvel kkkkkk   O game consiste em v¨¢rios mini-games, desde coop com seus amigos jogando em barcos piratas e soltando magias em bichos malignos, como atirar com armas de lazer e paintball em todo mundo no modo versus... ah sim, eu falei do movo battle royal? Sim... tamb¨¦m tem um hehe :P Tamb¨¦m tem as salas de conversa, tipo um VR-Chat e algumas coisas focadas em esporte como dodgeball, boliche e golf. As possibolidades s?o muitas j¨¢ que voc¨º mesmo pode criar sua propria sala e seu &quot;mini-game&quot; com suas regras e ser avaliado por outros jogadores.  Eu inclusive passei esses dias numa sala customizada onde o cara fez um parque de divers?es, ficou muito legal, e tinha dois jogadores na entrada vestidos de gatinhos que cumprimentavam a galera que chegava, muito bacana!   O game infelizmente n?o possui uma comunidade muito vasta, o que ¨¦ uma pena por que o game ¨¦ ¨®timo, e tamb¨¦m te possibilita jogar mesmo SEM ter um VR junto com a galera que tem. Mas mesmo assim voc¨º sempre encontra pessoas jogando de tudo que ¨¦ tipo de mini-game, raramente voc¨º espera muito tempo para come?ar alguma partida, o matchmaking aqui presta haha  Os servidores mesmo sendo fora do Brasil ainda assim s?o ¨®timos, senti pouco incomodo do lag, nada que fosse me dar muita desvantagem ou algo similar, ainda mais por que como falei acima, ¨¦ casual!   Vamos agora a uma pequeno  FAQ  que possa ajudar voc¨ºs a decidirem sobre o game:    ? O Game ¨¦ legal?  R: Sem duvida sim, mas cada um tem seu gosto, mas acredito que voc¨º ir¨¢ gostar.   ? Pay to Win?  R: N?o, tudo no game ¨¦ cosm¨¦tico.   ? Pessoas de VR tem vantagem ou desvantagem sobre Teclado/Mouse?  R: N?o, por que tudo depende da sua habilidade em cada perif¨¦rico   ? ? Pesado de rodar?  R: N?o, meu notebook com uma GT 1030(Vulgo MX150) rodou sussegada?o, ele s¨® se torna um pouco mais pesado em VR j¨¢ que tem que ser renderizado duas vezes, mas qualquer GTX 1060 j¨¢ aguenta sem suar em VR.   ? ? legal jogar Solo?  R: N?o muito, tem open lobby para qualquer mini-game que voc¨º for jogar, mas n?o esque?a que praticamente 99% da comunidade ¨¦ gringa, mas recomendo ter amigos, alias ¨¦ o foco do game ser casual e social.  Bom, eu n?o sei mais o que escrever, se caso voc¨ºs tiverem uma d¨²vida do game, podem testa-lo a vontade, ¨¦ de gra?a! Mas podem perguntar aqui que eu irei responder suas d¨²vidas se caso ainda n?o foi convincente e n?o est?o afim de baixar sem ter certeza!  No mais... Super recomendado! :)  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jimraynor/recommended/50300,1, Spec Ops: The Line ist ein klassischer Deckungsshooter, bei dem man aus der Deckung heraus wiederholt Gegnergruppen bek?mpfen muss, um zum n?chsten Bereich vorr¨¹cken zu k?nnen. Hierbei wird man von zwei Begleitern unterst¨¹tzt, die sowohl selbstst?ndig k?mpfen als auch gezielte Befehle des Spielers umsetzen. Auf Grund seiner Story MUSS man dieses Spiel jedoch gespielt haben.  Das herausragende Alleinstellungsmerkmal von Spec Ops: The Line ist seine Story. Sie basiert auf dem Buch &quot;Herz der Finsternis&quot; sowie dessen Verfilmung &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. Sie kommt anfangs erst langsam in Fahrt, entfaltet sich jedoch ab der H?lfte des Spiels, um am Ende einen v?llig verdutzten Spieler zur¨¹ckzulassen. In 20 Jahren Videospiele hat es kein Spiel geschafft, mich mit seiner Story so extrem zu bewegen und tagelang zu besch?ftigen. Kein Spiel vermochte es bisher auch nur ansatzweise den Irrsinn eines Krieges so eindringlich zu vermitteln. F¨¹hle ich mich wie ein Held?  W?hrend der Kampagne wird man vor mehrere, teils moralische Entscheidungen gestellt, die jedoch nicht immer offensichtlich sind und keinen Einfluss auf das Ende haben. Es gibt zwar verschiedene Enden, die sich jedoch aus den Handlungen im letzten Kapitel ergeben. Oder doch nicht?  Grafisch ist das Spiel sehr sch?n und f¨¹hrt mit dem allgegenw?rtigen Sand in Dubai ein neues, unverbrauchtes Spieleelement ein, das der Spieler zu seinen Gunsten nutzen kann oder gegen welches er ank?mpfen muss. Die musikalische Untermalung ist gro?artig und schafft es mehreren Gefechten eine unglaublich epische und coole Atmosph?re zu verpassen.  Vom reinen Gameplay her hat Spec Ops: The Line leider kleinere Schw?chen. Das Deckungssystem sowie die Steuerung haben ihre T¨¹cken und enden manchmal in ungewollten Aktionen, die zum Tod f¨¹hren k?nnen. Die KI-Begleiter verhalten sich zwar gr??tenteils intelligent, preschen manchmal jedoch etwas zu kopflos vor, wodurch sie verletzt und innerhalb einer begrenzten Zeit verarztet werden m¨¹ssen, um nicht zu verlieren. Auch das Gameplay wird mit der Zeit relativ repetitiv und etwas langweilig.  Trotz dieser Schw?chen sollte man das Spiel jedoch unbedingt durchspielen, sie werden durch die Story mehr als ausgeglichen. Der Wiederspielwert ist zwar relativ gering, wenn man die Story und seine Wendungen kennt, beim wiederholten Durchspielen findet man jedoch unz?hlige Details, die einem am Anfang verborgen blieben, sodass trotzdem ein gewisser Wiederspielwert besteht.  Das Spiel verf¨¹gt noch ¨¹ber einen Multiplayermodus sowie mehrere von der Story unabh?ngige Coop-Missionen, die man mit einem Freund spielen kann. Beides ist jedoch nur bedingt in das Spiel integriert und wirkt mehr wie &quot;drangeklatscht&quot;. Dennoch kann man mit dem Multiplayermodus und den Coop-Missionen nochmal ein paar Stunden Spa? haben, der Fokus des Spiels liegt jedoch eindeutig auf seiner Kampagne.   Solospielzeit: 5-10 Stunden Multiplayerspielzeit: 1-10 Stunden  + Herausragende &amp; einmalige Story + Gro?artige Atmosph?re und musikalische Untermalung + Moralische Entscheidungen + Man hasst sich selbst nach dem Spiel  +/- Wiederspielwert begrenzt, nur wenn man Spa? an unz?hligen Details hat, die man erst beim zweiten Durchgang sehen und verstehen kann  - Steuerung, Deckungssystem und Begleiterverhalten haben ihre Schw?chen und T¨¹cken - Gameplay kann mit der Zeit etwas langweilig und repetitiv wirken   Fazit: Trotz mehrerer Schw?chen beim Gameplay muss man Spec Ops: The Line einfach wegen seiner Story gespielt haben. Es gibt kein vergleichbares Spiel. Unbedingt spielen!

We had a first look at Final Fantasy XIV (14).   I was just thrown in to an awesome adventure.  Cool characters and awesome creatures are waiting for you in this  MMORPG.   ? POSITIVES ? ? Deep and detailed storytelling.  ? Appealing graphics.  ? Lots of customization abilities.  ? Cross platforms (Players on Playstation can play online with PC players).  ? Play with a game pad or use mouse &amp; keyboard.   ? NEGATIVES ? ¡ñ Confusing map system. As a first timer you don't know where to go.  ¡ñ Sometimes there is no music.  ¡ñ Some times there are voice over to the cut scenes, some times there isn't.    http://www.square-enix.com/    ?

https://steamcommunity.com/id/jimraynor/recommended/351910,1, Valhalla Hills ist ein klassisches Aufbaustrategiespiel und kann am Besten als eine Mischung aus Siedler 2 sowie Cultures beschrieben werden, mit einem Fokus auf den Elementen von Siedler 2. Es ist von den Entwicklern von Cultures, dessen f¨¹hrende K?pfe auch hinter Siedler 2 sowie dessen Remake Siedler 2 ¨C Die n?chste Generation standen.  Das Spielziel von Valhalla Hills ist es f¨¹r seine Wikinger, die man mit Namen und Kleidung individualisieren kann, gen¨¹gend Ehre zu sammeln, um sie nach Valhalla schicken zu k?nnen. Hierf¨¹r baut man zu Beginn klassisch seine Siedlung mit bekannten Produktionsketten auf, z.B. Holzf?ller -&gt; S?gewerk, Farm -&gt; M¨¹hle -&gt; B?ckerei, und verbindet die Geb?ude mit einem Wegesystem um deren Einzugsradius zu maximieren. Es gibt hierbei jedoch kein Tr?gersystem wie in Siedler 2, sondern die Produktionsgeb?ude holen ihre ben?tigten Rohstoffe selbstst?ndig ab. Beim Bau der Siedlung muss man noch die beiden Bed¨¹rfnisse seiner Wikinger, Hunger und M¨¹digkeit, beachten, um eine m?glichst produktive Siedlung zu erhalten. Der M¨¹digkeit ist hierbei mit Wohnh?usern in der N?he noch relativ einfach beizukommen, zumal die Wikinger notfalls auch unter einem Baum schlafen, was jedoch weniger Erholsam ist und somit l?nger ben?tigt, w?hrend hungrige Wikinger erst wieder mit vollem Magen weiterarbeiten. Daher stellt die Bereitstellung von Nahrung in der ganzen Siedlung, z.B. mit Fischern, J?gern oder B?ckern, eine besondere Herausforderung dar, gerade bei gr??eren Siedlungen.  Neben dem Aufbaupart lauern auf der Karte jedoch viele Gefahren, wie wilde Tiere, Eisriesen oder Eiszwerge, sodass man fr¨¹her oder sp?ter sein Milit?r aufr¨¹sten muss. Dieses besteht aus Axtk?mpfern und Bogensch¨¹tzen, f¨¹r die Waffen gibt es verschiedene Qualit?tsstufen, die man mit Malzbier (Leben) und Gold (Schaden) weiter verbessern kann. Die Steuerung des Milit?rs erfolgt hierbei ebenfalls indirekt, man setzt einen Sammelpunkt in dessen Radius die Wikinger selbstst?ndig Feinde attackieren. Mit Hilfe seiner Wikinger kann man sich nun langsam den Weg zum Portal freik?mpfen, um eine Insel abschlie?en und zur n?chsten Insel ¨¹bersiedeln zu k?nnen. Nach ein paar Inseln gesellen sich noch die Zwerge zu den Gegnertypen, die nach einer gewissen Zeit durch Portale an die Oberfl?che durchbrechen und damit beginnen, die Insel ebenfalls zu besiedeln. Sie werden mit der Zeit immer st?rker und zahlreicher, um fr¨¹her oder sp?ter auch Angriffe auf die eigene Siedlung zu starten. Sie stellen hierbei eine besondere Herausforderung dar und man muss wohl¨¹berlegt gegen sie vorgehen. Da man mit K?mpfen jedoch mit Abstand die meiste Ehre sammelt, sollte man sich nicht nur auf die Portale konzentrieren, sondern aktiv den Kampf mit allen Gegnern auf einer Karte zu suchen. Wer jedoch ungerne in Aufbauspielen k?mpft, dann die Zwerge als Gegner auch abschalten, um sich mehr auf den Aufbaupart konzentrieren zu k?nnen.  Das Spiel wird hierbei entweder im sogennanten progressiven Modus gespielt, der auch gleichzeitig als Tutorial dient, bei dem Geb?ude nach und nach freigeschaltet werden und die Inseln immer gr??er und schwerer werden oder es wird direkt eine Insel in beliebiger Gr??e und ausgew?hltem Schwierigkeitsgrad gestartet. Die Inseln entstammen hierbei in beiden Modi immer einem Zufallsgenerator, der f¨¹r Abwechslung sorgt und immer spielbare Karten ausw¨¹rfelt, jedoch mit unterschiedlichen Gefahren bzw. Problemen. Eine Kampagne gibt es leider nicht.  Auch wenn mir das Spiel unglaublichen Spa? macht, erreicht leider Valhalla Hills jedoch nicht ganz die Tiefe, Komplexit?t und Perfektion seiner Vorbilder. Es gibt etwas weniger Auswahl bei den verschiedenen Geb?uden und gerade bei gr??eren Siedlungen st??t das Zufallstransportsystem gerne an seine Grenzen. Man w¨¹rde gerne seine Siedlung weiter optimieren, z.B. indem man bestimmte Routen und Abholstationen einrichten w¨¹rde, jedoch gibt es hierf¨¹r keine M?glichkeiten. Nach etwa 5 Stunden hat man im progressiven Modus alle Geb?ude freigeschalten, wodurch sich der Aufbaupart darauf konzentriert, immer effektiver im Bau seiner Siedlungen zu werden. Nach etwa 10 Stunden wird mit den Zwergen ein neuer Gegnertyp eingef¨¹hrt, der eine neue Herausforderung darstellt und den man nur besiegen kann, wenn man zuvor seine Aufbauk¨¹nste perfektioniert hat. Nach etwa 15-20 Stunden hat man jedoch auch hier den Dreh raus und das Gef¨¹hl eigentlich alles gesehen zu haben. Die Herausforderung konzentriert sich dann darauf, immer gr??ere Berge zu meistern, wobei gerade die gr??t m?gliche Insel im Winterszenario und im &quot;Hard-Mode&quot; eine enorme Herausforderung darstellt.  Der Grafikstil ist mit seiner Comicgrafik sehr stimmig und passend. Es macht einfach Spa? den Wikingern bei der Arbeit zuzuschauen. Der Wuselfaktor ist definitiv vorhanden und man erwischt sich immer wieder dabei, einfach mal dem Treiben f¨¹r ein paar Minuten zuzugucken. Die Musik ist am Anfang sehr sch?n, extrem passend und eing?ngig, besteht jedoch leider nur aus 2 Titeln (1 normale Melodie und 1 Kampfmelodie), sodass man sich nach 10-20 Stunden doch irgendwann etwas mehr Abwechslung w¨¹nschen w¨¹rde.  Solospielzeit: 15-50 Stunden Multiplayerspielzeit: nicht vorhanden, wird eventuell noch erg?nzt.  + Wuselfaktor + Siedler 2-Gef¨¹hl + Sch?ner und stimmiger Grafikstil + Weiterhin Patches, Verbesserungen und neue Features/Geb?ude  +/- Zwar sehr sch?ne Musik, jedoch nur 2 Titel +/- Langzeitmotivation nach 20-30 Stunden abnehmend, jedoch trotzdem sehr ordentliche Spielzeit  - Fehlende Optimierungs- und Detailsteuerrungsm?glichkeiten - Keine wirkliche Story und Kampagne - Kein Multiplayermodus (Coop oder VS)   Fazit: Das Spiel richtet sich klar an Fans von klassischer Aufbaustrategie im Stile eines Siedler 2 oder Cultures. Trotz der erw?hnten Schw?chen empfehle ich Valhalla Hills jedoch uneingeschr?nkt allen Fans solcher Aufbaustrategiespiele. Seit Siedler 2 hat es kein Spiel mehr geschafft, mir ein ?hnlich wohliges Aufbaufeeling zu geben, sodass die St?rken eindeutig die Schw?chen ¨¹berwiegen. Auch wenn vielleicht die Suchtspirale nach 20-30 Stunden anf?ngt nachzulassen, wird man f¨¹r diese Zeit wunderbar unterhalten und m?chte auch danach immer mal wieder einen Berg in Angriff nehmen. Daher ist das Spiel jeden Cent wert. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/677340,1, The game features two introductory missions, four without combat, and four with combat. You cannot skip missions and there are no randomized maps. Each scenario is designed to take a while to complete, as key resources are usually located on opposite sides of the map; this results in lots of monotonous waiting for resource transport, even at the maximum game speed. The crux of the game is the collection and distribution of resources, starting with the basics (food, logs, iron ore, clay) and working up the production chain to more sophisticated goods (bricks, books, bread, glass, arrows). Residences are used to produce energy consumed by every building, and structures can upgrade to produce higher-level goods. The buildable area can be expanded by placing watchtowers, and the combat-focused scenarios include hostile AI opponents. There is a lot of data contained in the game concerning resource input and output rates, and keeping resource delivery travel times low and making sure you are producing the correct quantity of goods is important for success. Most resources can be produced indefinitely once you find an underground mine (with a couple exceptions, like salt), but this still requires careful expansion and resource usage until you discover those key locations. There is a significant amount of waiting for resources to accumulate (especially if your network is inefficient, which it usually is due to the scripted resource locations); this results in dull, repetitive gameplay for about half of each scenario. While The Colonists has a satisfying core of resource production and distribution, the dull, drawn-out scenarios coupled with a lack of random maps restrict the enjoyment.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUztCi7zT4s

There is an ongoing mystery narrative brought in the game's story, and the dialogue between Henry and Delilah is a social, emotional, life-reflecting journey. The game has an extreme depth to it, human depth and the depth of the narrative and ways the game tells you the story. The game is beautiful, with details and nuances everywhere that you could miss so much in your playthrough, and pick up things maybe another player had not. A must play.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/905450,1, New features in this year¡¯s version start with a dirt touring series that includes eight tracks (and a dirt road course). The career mode (which starts out in the new dirt series) adds the ability to be an owner/driver, allowing the player to hire staff and choose racing cars to perform research on. Online multiplayer adds tournaments, while the new Charlotte ¡°roval¡± and Phoenix redesign are included. A racing line is provided to learn each track, but only in practice mode. Also, there are nine pre-made car setups for each track that range between ¡°tight,¡± ¡°balanced,¡± and ¡°loose.¡± The short racing challenges round out the features. As in previous versions, NASCAR Heat 3 handles somewhere between an arcade game and a simulation, which strikes the balance the developers are looking for in a console-driven release. The cars are relatively easy to drive, and the AI is very aggressive and less idiotic as in last year¡¯s game. The sound design is not great (the collision effect is especially weak) and the game still lacks game options during a race (like saving progress for later or seeing what the controls are). Still, NASCAR Heat 3 is an improvement over last year, and is slowly approaching a solid arcade-sim racing game overall.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvTit1Y5E7c

https://steamcommunity.com/id/jimraynor/recommended/412460,1, Villagers ist ein klassisches Aufbauspiel, welches im Mittelalter angesiedelt ist. Obwohl es auf den ersten Blick stark an &quot;Banished&quot; erinnert, setzt es jedoch seine eigenen Schwerpunkte, indem es sich eher an Anf?nger statt an Profis richtet und den Fokus auf die Kampagne statt dem Endlosspiel legt.  Die Kampagne erz?hlt ¨¹ber 6 Missionen eine zusammenh?ngende Geschichte, die f¨¹r ein Aufbauspiel ziemlich gut gelungen ist. Sie wird zwischen den Missionen in Textform, leider ohne Sprecher, mit herausragenden, stimmungsvollen Artworks und Zeichnungen erz?hlt. Die Kampagne dient auch gleichzeitig als Tutorial und f¨¹hrt den Spieler in alle Geb?ude und Produktionsketten ein. Die Missionen haben unterschiedliche Schwerpunkte und Herausforderungen, die es jeweils zu meistern gilt. Die Kampagne ist auch der H?hepunkt des Spiels, leider jedoch bereits nach 5-6 Stunden durchgespielt. Danach kann man sich noch auf verschiedenen Karten im Endlosspiel versuchen, leider sind diese jedoch alle eher sehr klein und gr??tenteils bereits aus der Kampagne bekannt. Es gibt aber noch 2-3 neue Karten, die eigene Herausforderungen bieten und zu 1-3 weiteren Runden mit allen Geb?uden einladen. Somit ist der Umfang des Spiels mit 5-10 Stunden eher sehr gering f¨¹r ein Aufbauspiel und der Hauptkritikpunkt.  Villagers ist hierbei ein reines Aufbauspiel, aktive K?mpfe gibt es keine. Es gibt zwar seltene Zufallsereignisse, wie den Angriff von wilden Tieren oder R?ubern, die jedoch automatisch von J?gern oder Dorfwachen abgewehrt werden, wenn man entsprechende Geb?ude gebaut und Bewohner als Arbeiter zugeteilt hat. Hauptaufgabe des Spiels liegt darin, eine florierende Siedlung zu bauen und mittels verschiedener Produktionsketten alle Bewohner mit Nahrung, Trinken und Wohnraum zu versorgen. Es gibt mehrere Rohstoffe und Nahrungsmittel, die durch jeweils eigene Geb?ude/Produktionsketten gef?rdert bzw. angebaut werden k?nnen. Den Geb?uden k?nnen Arbeiter zugeordnet werden, wobei es wichtig ist eine gute Balance zwischen den verschiedenen Geb?uden und den vorhandenen Arbeitskr?ften zu finden, um die perfekte Siedlung bauen zu k?nnen. Knappe Ressourcen k?nnen von regelm??ig auftauchenden H?ndlern gekauft werden, die im Gegenzug ¨¹bersch¨¹ssige Produktion mitnehmen ¨C meist gibt es auf der Karte ein oder mehrere knappe G¨¹ter, die man per H?ndler beziehen muss.  Der Anspruch richtet sich klar an Anf?nger oder Menschen, die Abends eher noch gem¨¹tlich ohne viel Kopfzerbrechen eine Siedlung aufbauen m?chten. Das Spiel spielt sich zwar nicht von alleine und man muss durchaus ¨¹berlegt handeln, es ist jedoch bei weiterem weniger komplex und unerbittlich als Banished.  Die Grafik ist zweckm??ig, es gibt viele Aufbauspiele die deutlich sch?ner aussehen, dennoch habe ich sie nicht als schlecht empfunden und gerade bei den Details kann man trotzdem eine sehr gro?e Detailverliebtheit erkennen. Der Soundtrack und die Zeichnungen/Artworks sind jedoch ¨¹ber jeden Zweifel erhaben und bewegen sich durchg?ngig auf einem sehr hohen Niveau und untermalen das Spiel hervorragend. Einzig der deutsche Sprecher, der manche Ereignisse im Spiel ank¨¹ndigt, ist eher mittelm??ig. Technisch ist das Spiel auf einem sehr guten Niveau, es gab zwar zu Release einige Bugs, diese wurden jedoch innerhalb k¨¹rzester Zeit gefixed. Mir pers?nlich sind keine Fehler mehr beim Spielen aufgefallen, daher gibt es von technischer Seite keine Einschr?nkungen oder Vorbehalte.   Solospielzeit: 5 - 10 Stunden Multiplayerspielzeit: nicht vorhanden  + Sch?ne, interessante Kampagne + Sehr guter, stimmungsvoller Soundtrack + Liebevolle, hervorragende Zeichnungen/Artwork zwischen den Kampagnenmissionen + Hohe Detailverliebtheit  +/- Spielgrafik gewinnt zwar keine Preise, ist jedoch ausreichend +/- Komplexit?t und Schwierigkeitsgrad richten sich eher an Einsteiger, Profis k?nnten sich unterfordert f¨¹hlen  - Relativ geringe Spielzeit mangels Langzeitmotivation nach der Kampagne - Spielbare Karten alle vergleichsweise klein  Fazit: Villagers ist das perfekte Spiel f¨¹r Genreeinsteiger oder Spieler, die auch bei Aufbauspielen mehr Wert auf eine Kampagne mit konkreten Missionen als das Endlosspiel legen. Beide Gruppen d¨¹rften von Villagers nicht entt?uscht werden, wenn sie sich der eher geringen Spielzeit bewusst sind. F¨¹r Anf?nger mit einem Faible f¨¹r Kampagnen/Story in Aufbauspielen eine klare Empfehlung. F¨¹r Profis oder Spieler, die eine Herausforderung wie bei Banished suchen, d¨¹rfte Villagers zu anspruchslos und zusammen mit der eher geringen Spielzeit eine Ent?uschung sein. Diese Gruppe d¨¹rfte mit Banished besser beraten sein.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/783210,1, The single player game features historical play around the Mediterranean or randomly generated maps with good customization options but potentially unbalanced starting positions. A scenario editor and mod support are also available. The interface could be improved; specifically, the strategic overview that lists on-map objects and the political maps desperately need the ability to zoom in. Resources are collected from the map: mines, wood, and farms near cities automatically add their bounty nationwide. Cities can only produce specific units, and adding a new unit to a city¡¯s production roster requires an investment of resources (on top of the cost of actually making the unit), leading to interesting strategic decisions and less unit spam. Buildings outside of cities (such as the blacksmith, temple, and stable) can buff resource production or allow for the recruitment of advanced units. Cities, buildings, and units can also be improved to increase stats. Units fall under the typical categories of settler, infantry, cavalry, and naval forces, but more sophisticated versions can be researched. Government type and state decisions can alter your approach. Diplomacy comes with a good number of options, but there is no feedback whether some options will be accepted (and why they were not). Luckily, trade deals can be open-ended: you can request a specific resource and the partner will come back with an appropriate counter offer. Due to the time period, combat is relatively common, and the AI does a good job producing troops, attacking vulnerable units, and working well as a trade partner and ally. While Aggressors: Ancient Rome is more simplified than some other 4X games, it does not lack significant strategic decisions and its faster, combat-oriented pace is appealing.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OTJm5bmi4w

https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrAPOD/recommended/403190,1,   ? A First Look At - Planetbase - video ?     POSITIVES:   I like the graphics and the feel to the game. Animations and sound works for me. I'm looking forward to actually learn the game.     NEGATIVES:    I experience the camera to be a bit stiff and limited. The built in tutorial left me with the feeling I got so much more to learn to actually be able to succeed. The speed phase of the tutorial is also very slow. It could be a lot faster. I also appreciate some good music to the games. The music here was very soft and relaxing. sometimes there was no music at all.   So, at a first look I like the game and I recommend others to try it.    ? A First Look At - Planetbase - video ?  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/601540,1, The game features a campaign on several maps with varied character customization and background options (town leader, merchant, mercenary, et cetera); the game world carries over after you die and start a new character. There is also a sandbox mode for more direct tweaking. Towns produce gold through taxation, consume food, and collect resources from nearby mines, farms, and quarries. These resources can be used to construct new buildings and raise troops. Quests can be undertaken from neutral villages, while other factions in the game can be traded with or fought. Combat involves giving orders to troops using cumbersome, non-intuitive controls that use keyboard buttons instead of interface icons. The game world is an effective setting, with other factions going about their business before you intervene. The beginning of each scenario can be slow as you wait for resources to accumulate and better units to unlock, but large battles between different factions await. Overall, Veil of Crows is very reminiscent of Mount &amp; Blade, except with RTS-style battles in place of third-person combat, and is a mostly successful pivot of that construct.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUfdBDDoNIM  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrAPOD/recommended/359480,1,  ? A First Look At - Final Fantasy XIV - video ?   I'm Probably NOT the best gamer in the world. But man I love gaming.  We had a first look at Final Fantasy XIV (14).   I was just thrown in to an awesome adventure.  Cool characters and awesome creatures are waiting for you in this  MMORPG.   ? POSITIVES ? ? Deep and detailed storytelling.  ? Appealing graphics.  ? Lots of customization abilities.  ? Cross platforms (Players on Playstation can play online with PC players).  ? Play with a game pad or use mouse &amp; keyboard.   ? NEGATIVES ? ¡ñ Confusing map system. As a first timer you don't know where to go.  ¡ñ Sometimes there is no music.  ¡ñ Some times there are voice over to the cut scenes, some times there isn't.    http://www.square-enix.com/    ?

https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrAPOD/recommended/394340,1,     ? First Look At - Valhalla Hills - video  ?      Today I found my viking roots in the game, Valhalla Hills.  It's a sweet strategy builder game from Funatics Software.   Odin, the ruler of Asgard, is in a bad temper and trough his son and vikings out of Asgard since they lack of honor.   Your mission is to protect and help the vikings to regain their honor so they can return to Asgard.   POSITIVES:  I found the graphics very appealing (except the water line) and the viking animations are quite smooth and nice.  I like the cartoonish style and the environment looks good to my eye.  I like the music but hope it will vary a bit more since I progress trough the game.   NEGATIVES:  The game play and tutorial is confusing to me, and I don't understand exactly what I'm doing. WHat's on auto, and what's not... I think it's not to bad as soon you get the point, sort of say. I need a few hours before I get it.   So, at a first look I like the game very much and I definitely recommend others to try it.   http://www.valhalla-hills.com/       ? First Look At - Valhalla Hills - video  ?

If, like me, these series of games was a huge part of your childhood/teens growing up in the earlier days of PC gaming, why then this is a wonderful game you simply cannot afford to miss out on. And if they weren't, look 'em up and see if that kind of Dungeons &amp; Dragons-esque approach to a role-playing video game might be something that appeals to you - it just might.   I must, unfortunately, voice my opinion on the price: the game is a bit on the expensive side - you definitely want both the base game and the expansion for the full experience both in terms of story and gameplay. The latter is for some unexplicable reason is split up into two purchases, each with a hefty pricetag attached. Paradox plz.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/1982041400/recommended/711560,1,  Stone Flower is a hardcore pixel platformer in a minimalist style.  According to the plot, a powerful artifact was stolen, which for centuries was guarded by monks alive in the mountains. But the attacker didn't know that this would cause the last guardian of the ancient artifact, whose only purpose is to return and protect him.  The graphics are presented in a pixel-style, very reminiscent of other famous platformers like VVVVVV and Super Meat Boy.  Gameplay is reminiscent of oldschool games. It is difficult but enthralling, and a lot of secrets make it all better to explore. From the part this is an action, because it will be possible to use several types of weapons.  Exellent for fans of oldschool games, as well as those who want to spend a few pleasant evenings.  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Alcohol_Fueled_Brewtality/recommended/527430,-1, TL;DR - I love the idea of the game, but it left Early Access far too early. It wasn't ready then, it isn't ready now. But it is getting there albeit slowly.  Really hurts me to leave a negative review because overall I like the game, but I can't lie.  Sadly, there currently is just so much left broken and non-functioning when it comes to things like skills, perks and Heroic Deeds (which are basically achievements in-game used to unlock various things such as more perks) that the game was clearly not ready to leave Early Access just yet.  Still, the devs are constantly working on improving and fixing the game so it will most likely all get fixed in the end (they haven't abandoned the game, far from it) and once they do, I'll be the first to change my negative review to a positive one.  I just cannot with a clear conscience recommend the game, at full price, in it's current state.

There is  a very impressive selection of guns that you get to use to fight the specimens off. The players also get to choose their class. The class system is great, because it allows teammates to specialise, what means that teamwork is encouraged greatly. Requires good tactics and has  great atmosphere. Every class has their own sets of priorities, each have their drawbacks and advantages.The sound effects are great, and the soundtracks made by Zynthetic are phenomenal. Overall Tripwire has truly put so much content and work into this game that it's a must  in your inventory. &lt;3 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/MilkyChews/recommended/105600,1, Addictive and fun. Can get lost in this game for hours.   Great for getting your mind off things.  There is always something to do, Build/Collect/Explore. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/MilkyChews/recommended/696790,1, A good call of duty. Its only a beta and I imagine the full game will have a lot of content. The move away from space rubbish is good. Cod gets a lot of hate because people aren't good at staying alive, that is part of the game. The better you get the less you die...  People who moan about the &quot;multiplayer&quot; having females and different skin colors are thick as. The campaign will be historically accurate. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/MilkyChews/recommended/487220,1, Not too hard but it takes focus.   5 Achievements to unlock. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/MilkyChews/recommended/346110,1, It has dinosaurs and they actually look good.  Since they fully released and actually optimised the game it runs pretty good. I really enjoy playing it. It's a lot better with friends tho.  This was too funny.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1082333586  
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198110406618/recommended/232090,-1, Killing Floor 2 is a sequel to the popular and successful Killing Floor 1. Keep in mind that Killing Floor 2 is in early access and has yet to receive a full release. Many players from the previous title may know that some of the new features of Killing Floor 2 included sprinting and crosshair, which may come as a disappointment. While I personally do not believe this should be an issue at all for both veteran and new players, it does remove the aspect of having your knife out to run quicker.  About the  graphics  - there is no doubt that there is a big improvement. The game has updated graphics and textures which look significantly better than they did before.   There are 10  waves  and on the 11th wave you have to fight against a boss (either the Patriarch or Hans Volter for now). By the end of your tenth wave the map you¡¯re surviving appears splattered in blood from each shot you make. It¡¯s a good feature and definitely adds atmosphere to the chaos.   The first Killing Floor provided a selection of 7  perks . Killing Floor 2¡¯s Early Access contains 9 perks for now - Berserker, Commando, Support, Field Medic, Demolitionist, Sharpshooter, Firebug, Gunslinger and the new perk Swat. Once the game reaches its full release it is rumoured that it will include 10 perks in total. Each perk has its own special skill which is unlocked at levels 5,10,15,20 and 25 and there are two options of which you can't choose your special skill.   The specimens  in Killing Floor 2 are a bit modified compared to Killing Floor 1. There are not many combos you can use for the insta - kill of the big zeds. I have seen one for the medic with his nades and I can't even call it a combo, more like a simple strategy and one for the firebug. So it is not very easy to kill Fleshpounds and Scrakes. The one thing I don't like is that if someone enrages the Scrake or the Fleshpound, they can attack anyone they want. So I find it really annoying to have them charging against me, without being prepared to kill them. Headshots here are essential, so try your best not to miss them.  I have a mixed feeling when it comes to  teamplay  . When the waves get harder in some of the cases everybody just runs around trying to save theirselves and it would be pure luck if you end the wave with your teammates being around you, because in some situations it is impossible to stay together. So it is best to count on yourself to finish the wave, alive.   There are not many  guns  added to this game, but hopefully new ones will be released soon.  More maps, weapons, game modes, removing classes imbalance, fixing teleporting zeds and concentrating on the game's development rather than adding cosmetics will definitely make more Killing Floor 2 players happy.   Overall I would not recommend  this game to other people for now, because Tripwire have turned it into  a casual game. You play 1-2 maps and everything is okay, but  after that it gets deadly boring ... If I have to compare it with KF1 - a BIG lack of content. Sure it is an early access, but there aren't any signs of progress.  In the end after playing around 400 hours I came to the following conslusion: Killing Floor 2 - a game where disscussing other player's performance it is more important than the game itself. Enjoy.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/MilkyChews/recommended/578080,1, Surprise attacking people is way too funny. Hiding somewhere after seeing people then massacring there whole team is too good. Getting to the top 5 can be really fun.  The combat is really well done. Good selection of guns and throwables. The game will only get better as it ages.  Everyone is pretty social on this game which is good since you need to communicate to survive...  Callum has a wee cry when there is no guns. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/MilkyChews/recommended/242760,1, The graphics are great and it runs well.   Multiplayer is pretty good, its fun building a base and exploring with others. The hunting is cool but I feel like the world still needs more animal types. The traps and build options add fun ways to kill the locals. It is also fun playing solo in a multiplayer lobby with the option of having others join. You make it private if you want to play alone, that way you can do either and not have to start again.  I have not even tried to rescue timmy :D so I have not played the story.  Cheaters on multiplayer are very annoying, I really don't see the point of it, It ruins the game. I make several saves just so if a hacker joins I can go back to before....I have a pretty long list of banned people. Everyone else is sound though. The more I have banned the less it happens so its ok. I see why people use console comands but its very annoying when you are just trying to play the game. I think its ok once you finish the game but no when joining other people's games.  Edit: Rescued timmy, I think the poor lad has seizures now after his ordeal  ;( wink wink.  I got every achievement :P

https://steamcommunity.com/id/FlauscheNathy/recommended/423810,1, Ein chaotisches Partyspiel, mit bis zu 6 Spielern. Es ist Online gegen fremde onder Freunde sowie lokal, zuhause spielbar.  Einen Einzelspieler gibt es leider nicht.  F¨¹r den Spa? zwischendurch ist es auf jeden Fall was :D  Man kann eine Menge neuer Charaktere und Gegenst?nde freischalten. Schaut euch doch mein Video dazu an:  Marooners Action  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/FlauscheNathy/recommended/374040,1,   Portal Knights - ich bin gespannt, was noch kommt   Ein sehr liebevoll gestaltetes Game ? Tolle Grafik ? Hab jetzt schon einige St¨¹ndchen gespielt und mir gef?llt es immer noch sehr gut. Egal ob allein, oder mit Freunden zusammen.  Die Story k?nnte allerdings noch etwas ausgeschm¨¹ckt werden. Ich bin gespannt wann und wie es weiter geht und freue mich auf kommende Updates des Spieles ?    Zur ersten Folge von Portal Knights  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/FlauscheNathy/recommended/376870,1, Die Umsetzung gef?llt mir wirklich gut ? Die Story ist auch gut gelungen.. Wenn man einmal anf?ngt, m?chte man am liebsten nicht mehr ausmachen ^^)  Leider vermisse ich die deutschen Untertitel...    Ein Abenteuer beginnt in Minecraft Story Mode - A Telltale Games Series  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/FlauscheNathy/recommended/252950,1, Ich wei? noch, wie ich damals diese eigentlich total sinnfreien Rennspiele geliebt habe.. Umso besser, dass es nun Rocket League gibt.  Ein Spiel zum abfeiern und gleichzeitig zum aufregen.. Ich bin auf weitere DLC?s gespannt ? 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/FlauscheNathy/recommended/227600,1, Wie man an meinen Spielstunden sieht, ist es ein recht kurzes Game. Dennoch ein sehr liebevoll gestaltetes Remake ?.  Fands toll f¨¹r die kurze Zeit nochmal an meine Kindheitstage erinnert zu werden. Jedoch hab ich es deutlich schwerer in Erinnerung gehabt ^^)    Auf zum Part 1   
https://steamcommunity.com/id/FlauscheNathy/recommended/359050,1, Wow... warum genau spiele ich dieses Spiel eigentlich ? Aber es macht Spa?. Die Musik im Game finde ich auch passend und animierend.. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/FlauscheNathy/recommended/275850,1, Bisher l?uft es ohne Probleme bei mir.. Keinen einzigen Absturz gehabt.  Raus und wieder Rein Tabben geht nur, wenn ihr das Spiel auf Fenstermodus stellt ! In den Einstellungen kann man die FPS Begrenzung auf 60 einstellen.   Ich w¨¹rde mir w¨¹nschen, dass es zumindest f¨¹r Freunde m?glich ist, sich zu treffen.. geschweigedenn ¨¹berhaupt zu sehen, wo diese sich in der Galaxie befinden..

https://steamcommunity.com/id/FlauscheNathy/recommended/293500,1,   Amazing World ist ein unglaublich knuddeliges, s¨¹?es Spiel.   Dieses Spiel ist f¨¹r Kinder.  Dementsprechend sind die Quests und R?tsel recht einfach gehalten. Es hat trotzdem sehr viel Spa? gemacht, es mit Freunden zusammen zu spielen.  Bis Level 10 ist es Free2Play, ab dann kostet es monatlich 3.99¢ã.  Ich habe dazu auch ein kleines Let?s Play gestartet:   Hier geht es zum ersten Video

https://steamcommunity.com/id/FlauscheNathy/recommended/428690,1, Das Spiel macht schon Spa? und ¨¹berzeugt mich mit seiner knuddel Grafik. Schade ist, dass sich viel wiederholt.. So muss man zB st?ndig auf Partys gehen, die zwar verschiedene Themen haben, aber im Grunde irgendwie das gleiche sind ^^) Man kann bisher nur die Let?s Play Karriere spielen. Ich hoffe dass bald die anderen Youtube Zweige freigeschaltet werden.    Hier gehts zu meinem ersten YoutubersLife Video

https://steamcommunity.com/id/manicado/recommended/579180,1,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_woRBknbp8M   Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana has you participate in the story of Adol and Dana, the two main characters, while being able to alternate between them and a multitude of other characters in order to unravel and experience a deep and memorable plot involving the fate of the world. The cursed Seiren Island is an open world environment you can roam while taking down various monsters and enemies. Players meet new friends along with exploring and collecting materials for use in crafting healing items and stronger weapons.  The game opens with you, as Adol, on-board a famous ship, the Lombardia, which sadly doesn¡¯t get to the destination he was headed for. The player crashes near an unknown island (called the Isle of Seiren), where they struggle to survive and unearth many mysteries while saving people scattered around different locations.     -- POSITIVES --    Dual story-lines and emotional journey The majority of the time you are in control of Adol, but there¡¯s a period of the story-line where you go travel through time in order to relive Dana¡¯s life that led to her becoming the Maiden of the Forest. This adds to the backstory and depth of the plot, making the world feel detailed and fleshed out as it allows you to play it rather than simply explain Dana's backstory through dialogue. Throughout the whole playthrough, the plot evoked many emotions that were flowing within me. Whether it would be happiness to the extreme or the contrary being extreme sadness. The story in this game provides you with a beautiful journey and emotional roller-coaster.   Endearing characters  You¡¯ll meet a wide range of characters, from ones you want to hug to others which you want to punch in the face. Normally, you¡¯d wish the annoying characters would not exist but Ys VIII does a great job of eventually making you attached to everyone, even the ones you dislike. You learn more about them as Adol includes more into the party from either his fellow castaways or residents of the island, and realize that each has something to contribute to exposition for the plot (such as Laxia, a noblewoman, providing information on Eternia).   Entrancing music The musical score in Ys VIII is simply outstanding and superb, the team at Falcom and Yukihiro Jindo (the composer) has produced music which has left a mark on me months after playing. I often find myself listening to the official soundtrack and humming Dana¡¯s theme to myself when I¡¯m working on various tasks. Each song and sound really enhances the experience during gameplay and provides a perfect complement for the fantasy nature of the world.   Areas, exploration and maps The Isle of Seiren doesn¡¯t skimp out with places to explore and different varieties of locations. There¡¯s one point where you can even go underwater thanks to a handy relic which takes it beyond just land-based combat. There¡¯s huge mountains, dense forests, dark caverns, boggy marshlands and so much more which really adds to the immersive nature of the open world genre. The variety of beautiful locations makes you awe in the design of it all, as well, as you can tell that the team at Falcom really wished to convey a sense of nature-meets-magic.   Longevity  Lacrimosa of Dana provides a real in-depth story and lasting narrative. Fortunately, at no point did the story feel like it was dragging on and it flows nicely through the course of 30 hours or so; yet, neither did it feel as if it was too short or left with any kind of cliffhanger. Ys VIII also provides a true ending for completing most of what the game has to offer, so it gives you more motivation to go through every nook and cranny of the Seiren Island.   Building up a base, surviving, and friend quests Upon crashing onto the Isle of Seiren, you¡¯re automatically plunged into a scenario which brings you back to having nothing. With the survivors, you can gather items and materials to build up the base and defenses as well as helping survivors with their quests and needs. This is a great amount of content that's been integrated into the Seiren Islands and gives the player lots to do to fill up gameplay. It wasn't too overdone and quests weren't repeated too much to make the game feel padded and instead felt organic as any hero adventurer traveling through a fantasy universe would since helping villagers and solving mysteries.    -- NEGATIVES --    Attention-seeking Raids  Every time I got engrossed and wanted to explore more, the little parrot would beep up and say ¡°Alert! Alert! Camp is under attack¡±. While I believe you don¡¯t have to do them, I didn¡¯t want to take any chances and found myself constantly teleporting back to a ¡®defend the base¡¯ type mini-game, which I¡¯m not really a fan of. That being said, if you enjoy 'defend the base' type missions, this may be a positive for you. This may seem like nitpicking but when something detracts away from my exploring to do a mundane task such as this then it has a negative impact on me.   Predictability of boss fights  Every single boss fight on Ys VIII is extremely predictable in terms of when they will show up. I found myself knowing and stocking up before each and every boss on the game. This took away from the element of surprise and made sure I was fully prepared for each and every encounter as there is no point at anytime that I was caught off guard. If there were more unexpected boss battles then it would add to a more challenging gameplay instead of ensuring I was always prepared. Many players may feel like this is a sort of hand-holding.   Customization is just a palette swap  When I unlocked the tailor I got extremely excited upon hearing of character customization. Excluding the DLC, the customization was a major let down as the different outfits were just color swaps of their regular uniforms. While I understand being limited on the physical side of character customization, I really wish that the outfits actually changed instead of being just a simple color change.   Accidental special usage  I found that when playing on PS4, to activate a special ability you need to press L1 and R1 together to activate it. The control scheme also has the dodge button on L1 and block on R1, which could cause the player to accidentally activate the special at times when it's not needed. This, during more action-packed fight sequences, was a bit frustrating due to the fact that special attacks took a while to build up and could also save you from potential death situations in a pinch.   PC Port Issues  While this is a more technical point to the review, many people who have played the PC ported version thus far are having issues with it being buggy, crashing, glitching, and not acting how it should. I¡¯m one of the fortunate few who¡¯ve encountered zero problems in either version of the title, however, I felt it was worth noting here -- for anyone considering to get it for PC -- that many have noticed this and that it's still unknown whether it has to do with the build of your computer or some other yet-unrealized software issue.    -- CONCLUSION --   It¡¯s not often you come across masterpieces, but Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is simply breathtaking and provided a voyage which has left a lifelong and emotional mark on me. There is minor annoyances to be mentioned for the game but none have seriously impacted my love for it as all the positives far outshine the negatives. From the wide range of characters to the scenery and an out-of-this-world musical score, I highly recommend this as a purchase to anyone who enjoys action RPGs that contain an in-depth story and fun gameplay.  Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is simply one of the best games that I¡¯ve ever encountered and played in my life. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/manicado/recommended/666020,-1, Shark Dating Simulator XL (SDSXL) has a lot of potential but ultimately falls short and we see SDSXL sink to the bottom of the reefs quite quickly. Uninstalled and forgotten.  Comedy is a skill which very few people grasp and doesnt just mean being random and putting random things in for the sake of it.  The skeleton of the story and general direction of it I enjoy, the actual content is mostly cringey and forced humour which tends to be either very hit or miss. Talking of content, there really isnt a lot of content to the game which was quite unfortunate as the store page reads as though there would be a multitude of routes and options thus leaving my excitement and hype for SDSXL very short lived.  Unfortunately, as with most Early Access games this has been released far too early. From all the delays and setbacks just for one part of the story which was twenty minutes, I'm very doubtful on the &quot;early 2018&quot; goal being hit. Hopefully with a few more updates this game will be set back on track and will be recommendable, but until then, I feel very short changed and let down.   That's quite surprising, considering SDSXL comes in at a very low price. Hopefully the initial wave of &quot;OMGBESTGAMEEVER&quot; and &quot;ILUVSHARKS&quot; will die down and SDSXL will get the valuable feedback it requires to be a good visual novel but until then, I can't quite possibly recommend it.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/manicado/recommended/658570,-1, Video review -   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXj4vueSgDQ   Building your indie game around an online experience with a high initial price is more often than not suicide. This game suffers the same fatal problem many other online based indie games face - A dead playerbase, even upon launch.  This pretty much turns this game into an expensive drift sandbox. I¡¯d rather recommend GRID series instead or any other game with drifting and single player. There is no real single player mode to this game, just a simple practice mode where you¡¯re alone doing drifts and to even include DLC is absolutely absurd. Yes it¡¯s only visual, but what is the point of that? The price is already through the roof as it is.   Without online all the game falls down to being is an offline sandbox of pointless non-objective based drifting. That being said, I could¡¯ve had miniscule fun drifting around pointlessly for a bit but sadly I couldn¡¯t even have that, as the game didn¡¯t even include controller support.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/manicado/recommended/605740,-1,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0RFp63ligU   The base is there for an amazing experience, sadly the game is not done enough. It's simply too early to be put on Early Access. This game is like pre-early access. I know people will hate me for this review, but there's not a lot of content at all. There are so many bugs and it's really a stretch to play it after 30 minutes. The price is extremely high for what it is too.  The developer should have maybe ran an open beta instead of trying to cash in already. I also dislike how the trailer makes the game seem even better than it actually is.   I really wanted to love this game, I really wanted it to be great but at this current moment in time, it's still WAY too early. That's not to say I won't be updating this review in 6-9 months time when there's some more content. I really just can't recommend this in the state it's currently in.   I understand it's all been made by a solo developer. It's a great achievement and I really hope Nils can push forward with the project and complete it.  Thank you very much.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/manicado/recommended/346110,-1, EDIT: I've played longer than 2 hours. I've played 48 hours on Xbox One. That brings a total of 50 hours. So before you comment &quot;you'only played 2 hours&quot; please think again and realise Steam is not the only way to play games. I also state I HAD A LOT OF FUN IN ARK.     By all means a fun game with lots to do.   However, I do not accept paid DLC when in Early Access. I do not accept unnecessary price hiking and I certainly do not accept greed and milking the consumers for every little cent they have.  We need to stand against this, being milked by dlc, season passes, pre order bonuses and suits who don't understand gaming from the consumer side of things. Suits that only have interest in figures and numbers.  I have not bought DLC for a long time now and only plan to support DLC when it's needed WELL AFTER release date. A good example would be Witcher 3. As for day 1 DLC...Pfft. Will never touch with a barge pole.  That being said, I love gaming, I grew up gaming and will be gaming till I die. I enjoyed triple-a titles only but all of the milking has turned me sour on AAA Games and I really don't enjoy them as much as indie games now.

Thanks for not cluttering our store with asset flips, scammers and dodgy developers. I totally feel safe reaching out to developers professionally.   Thanks for having wonderful genre filtering in the store. I'm super glad that Steam Direct was a huge success. I'm glad that removing trading cards got rid of all the fake games. I'm also glad to not see VR games in store section too when I've filtered them out!  2018 is amazing. &lt;3

The problem is, this URL is broken and doesnt work. From the rest of their site they just boast about working with clients like Robocraft and such.  What a huge upset. Was looking forward to this game. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/manicado/recommended/690090,-1, Game lasted almost as long as I did.... (not very long)  Short content and I didnt even stay for the plot. (It was too boring... normally I stay for the plot!)  The elf also has a weird breast. Not sure what's going on there.  For those interested seeing it:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iDbnvbIndk

https://steamcommunity.com/id/seph_au/recommended/631510,-1, Barebones port to say the least, makes me wonder why it took so long to arrive, perhaps capcom just needed the money. DMC &quot;HD&quot; uses original low resolution ps2 movies and same gigantic UI that isn't widescreen. Textures seem to be a complete cut-copy-paste from console with no visual upgrade whatsoever. Game runs at twice normal speed if using high refresh rate monitor, need to force cap 60fps otherwise it's completely broken. Resolution capped to 1080p..  If you can overlook these issues that should have been patched prior launch and don't really care about it truly being HD which it's not. Then by all means buy, cap to 60fps and enjoy. If never played series before (what's wrong with you?) it's well worth your time. Completed games and not super keen to replay? just wait for sales. Other then finally being released on PC and running at 60fps, it's really nothing special and borderline false advertising imo.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Eludium/recommended/265670,-1, From a somewhat decent little platformer,  Imagine Me  fell to a plain mediocre game. Back one year ago, this game had pre-defined levels that were fun to play just to pass time. Now it has some badly designed generated levels. I often found myself playing the same level and it gets boring very easily. I'd suggest the devs go back to the previous stage of the game and improve it.    Pros:  + The Challenge levels are pre-defined and were fun to play; it took me a short while to complete them all, but they weren't that bad;    Cons:  - Generated repetitive levels, gets boring in a short while; -Lacks initiative, there are only 2 types of enemies, 2 types of traps and 1 weapon; -Boss levels are random aswell, many people complained that they had to play dozens of stages to finally reach a boss area; -More soundtracks were welcome..    Conclusion:   I would recommend  Imagine Me  only if you really can't afford any other platformer out there. Even then, you would probably put it away soon. The gameplay lacks many features and I see no real reason to replay the game after you have finished it.  Personal rating: 30/100 - Awful 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Eludium/recommended/282140,1, Let me get this straight ahead and confirm that the wait for SOMA was, 100%, well-worth it. Frictional delivers yet another masterpiece. I even dare say they followed the saying: ''There's always room for more.'', after their fantastic Amnesia series. What we got from them here is one of those existential questioning games... combine that with horror, well-suited atmosphere,  incredible  sound effects and you get a memorable gem.  SOMA has less enemy encounters than Amnesia, but I say it's for a good cause. What it lacks in terms of monsters, it completely delivers with the story. I'd say they got the perfect balance between hiding and actual advancing through the events. More encounters would have made me forget about the plot and it would have gotten unimmersive. But when there is a monster showing around, expect it to be a challenging part. No more hiding in a corner and waiting for it to leave as in previous games, as SOMA's creatures are not just randomly going away after a while. They'll stay in your path and you have to carefully progress through the chambers and remember the map, in order to get away safe and sound.  I did mention this is more of an existentional questioning game. I can't dig deeper into details on this one as it would all lead to story-breaking spoilers. Heck, even the premise of it is a spoiler. All I can say is that it successfully made me question what it is to be a human and what distinguishes us from artificial intelligences --robots-- .  What I also loved about it was its length. 13 hours to finish an indie game is nothing short of amazing and I didn't even stay to read all notes and journals. I'll definitely give this game a second playthrough.  The inventory has been massively simplified since Amnesia and the sanity/health system is also changed. Looking at some monsters for too long will give away your position and health can be restored at healing places throughout the journey.  Technically speaking, the game suffers from a poor optimization. I was getting massive frame drops in some places. Visually it does not excel either. But I can get past these issues coming from a small company. On the other side, I haven't encountered many bugs nor grammatical errors and kudos to the developers for taking their time and patching up their game!  *End-game debate incoming (definitely spoilers ahead); please skip to next paragraph for general personal rating if you haven't completed the game yet.* The feeling that was following me up to the very end was one of d¨¦j¨¤ vu. There is another game out there that raised the exact same questioning:   The Talos Principle. Apocalypse, AI that would replace the mankind and would live through a new aeon? These two games are as if set in the same universe. If you put away the gameplay of them, you will notice that they both follow the same plot.  Is artificial intelligence capable of replacing the human brain? In SOMA, a group of scientists work in projecting it on digital chips. The Talos Principle follows a similar path, with one AI already constructed and left in sleep mode until it proves that it acts and  thinks  humanlike. In both games you are playing as a virtual mind placed into a carcass, in order to continue human legacy. Could these two games be set in the same world? The similarities between them are astonishing. Also, SOMA's concept of replicating someone's mind is extremely intriguing. Are you the first AI copy of Simon after his death? Like in the end of the game, where he is duplicated and a part of him remains alone for an eternity on a wasted planet, while the other rests forever in the ARK, on a digital island.. The main character could very well not be the first copy of his brain awoken.      Pros:   + Excellent plot and an overall amazing storyline. The journey that the player takes from the beginning to the end never ceased to amaze me. + Incredible sound effects. Not just one time have I thought some environment sounds are actually coming from my room.  + Perfect mix of horror and story telling. + Impressively long while still maintaining to not get boring. + Great puzzles that add to the core, just like in the Amnesia series. + The atmosphere perfectly blends in. + The voice acting is also well-crafted. + More types of monsters with different behaviors. They also have some great sound effects implemented, you will hear them if they're wandering on a nearby corridor or if they have detected you. + Overall balanced difficulty. Does not make the player replay the same area countless of times due to dying, but is also thought as to not be rushed through with ease. + Does continue Frictional's unique horror style.    Neutral:   +/- Different system of health and sanity, like shortly described above. Some players may welcome the changes with open arms, while others may dislike it compared to the old one from Amnesia: The Dark Descent. +/- Depending on everyone's tastes, I suppose the game suffers from a lack of replayability. +/- Enemy AI. They're not brainless, but nothing amazing about their thinking either.    Cons:   - Poor optimization... may encounter frame drops, stutter and even freezes in some areas, even while lowering the settings. - Infinite battery flashlight. A similar system to the one from older Frictional titles would also suit SOMA better in my opinion and would add to the difficulty. - Uhm... where's the enemy robots? I was disappointed to only encounter the big machines with flashlights 2 or 3 times and only in the first quarter of the game... They were some great enemies in my opinion and would have surely also suited some other areas. - Can get extremely frustrating to cope with the visual screen tearing while the monster is chasing you. Later on in the game, you're almost always getting caught by it if he sees you, anyway.  SOMA is a must for anyone that loved Frictional's other games. For the others, this is a great decision if you're looking for a thrilling story with scary elements and atmosphere. I definitely not regret pre-ordering this one and I want to thank the developers for bringing in another masterpiece to Steam.  Personal rating: 91/100 - Amazing 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Eludium/recommended/315430,1,  Polarity  is a fun little puzzle game, whether you are in for some achievement hunting or simply want to face some brain challenges. However, note that this game's stages are nowhere near the level of other puzzles games such as  Portal  or  The Talos Principle . Most of the levels in  Polarity  won't leave you thinking for more than 2 or 3 minutes, sometimes the solution is painfully obvious, making the completion of this game feel rushed, even though there are 20 levels attached to it.  The goal of the game is to reach the end chamber of each level (similar to the  Portal  series). In doing so, you have to make use of red and blue cubes in order to activate different mechanisms. In addition, you can change your player's &quot;polarity&quot; from red to blue and vice-versa. This is mainly useful because some walls only allow you to pass through them if you are in their specific polarity.  We are presented with a poor attempt at a story, which will not matter in the slightest throughout the game and only serves as a filler. However, this isn't anything important if you don't care much about a storyline.  Polarity  is, after all, a puzzle game.  The game looks pretty, visuals are nothing too impressive, but they're on point for its genre. Unfortunately, the game seems unpolished. There are glitches, some slightly unfinished areas, while the places which represent abyssal falls are literally... void, leaving the map in a lackluster state.  The music is pretty much alright. Fortunately, there's a couple of songs attached to it, so the same tune will not repeat through each level.  The store page of the game claims to feature a multiplayer factor. However, this is partly true. You can only play a local co-op campaign with your friend, on the same computer, using either a keyboard and a controller, or two controllers.    Summary:     Pros:   + Fun little game to kill time with and relax; + Overall a nice simplistic approach to games such as  Portal ; + Collectibles and achievements, as well as the co-op campaign, encourage replayability; + Ambient music that fits the game's setting;    Cons:   - Some people will find the experience lacking, due to the easy challenges and small amount of gameplay mechanics; in addition, this may lead to a fast completion of the game, maybe too fast for its price; - Unfinished, visually speaking; the pits that serve as obstacles are pitch black, as if parts of the map are just missing; - Even though a multiplayer feature is out of the question, since the player base is pretty much dead, a more advanced co-op feature would be appreciated, letting players play with their friends, each on their own system; - Occasional bugs here and there;    Personal rating:   62/100 - Decent

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Eludium/recommended/493530,1,  *Review of the main game can be found  here .   While certainly not sharing the glory of the main game,  Inheritance  is still a good DLC and totally worth the price.  The player returns to  Layers of Fear 's cursed house, this time taking control of the painter's daughter. She has returned to  put an end to the insanity that runs in her family . By visiting the chambers of the house, she will recall memories relevant to them. These memories consist the gameplay of the DLC, as you will control a young version of the main character and discover how she and her father were getting along. Your decisions will affect the ending of the story: you can decide whether to listen to your dad or not, and in one particular memory you will be asked to choose the mother's path or the father's path.   Inheritance  takes a different approach to the horror genre when compared to the base game. While still presenting a dark, mysterious atmosphere, the DLC does not make use (for the most part) of jumpscares, instead bringing terror to the player by the story line alone. At its turn, the story is not particularly brilliant, but the fact that you can choose your own path, which will lead to different outcomes, will keep you engaged.  The gameplay is the same one from  Layers of Fear . However, it introduces a flashlight to navigate the environment with, as the house is now abandoned and the lights are all dead. The game is not long, yet not shorter than it should be either. I finished it in about 2-3 hours. It's the right amount of content for a DLC of its price and for the story it presents.  While the soundtrack of the base game was thoroughly exceptional, I can't say the same about the one from  Inheritance . It is not bad in any way, though it does not excel either. When outside the childhood memories, it only plays one piece. There is an atmospheric melody inside one of the memories which I believe is the peak of the DLC's song line. However, the sound effects are still just as well-placed as the ones from the main game, massively contributing to the horror factor. The voice acting is decent and shouldn't have a negative impact on the immersion.  As you would probably expect,  Inheritance  uses the same graphical engine of the base game, thus revealing yet again a wonderful-looking final product. In spite of this, the field of view when playing as a child is frustrating and possibly even immersion-breaking.    Summary:     Pros:   + Dark, creepy atmosphere, further expanded by the story line; + Memories fueled by player decisions encourage replayability, in order to achieve all the possible outcomes; + The right amount of content, not too short nor too long; + Impressive visuals, just like in the main game; + Great sound system; even though the soundtrack does not reach the level of the one from  Layers of Fear , the sound effects are still on point; + Polished experience, bug-free and no crashes, graphical or performance issues;    Neutral:   +/- It's something different compared to the main game, in terms of horror;  Inheritance  focuses less on jump scares and more on a disturbing, twisted plot;    Cons:   - Annoying field of view when playing the childhood memories; - There is no challenge; dying does not affect the game and there is only a single memory featuring a real enemy;    Personal Rating:    76/100 - Good  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Eludium/recommended/57300,1, After spending days thinking about what to write in this review, I finally have come to the conclusion that mere words cannot summarize this gem of a game. I could write tremendously long essays describing what makes  Amnesia: The Dark Descent  an unique masterpiece, but it's to no avail. One would have to play the game in order to understand its beauty and its charm...   &quot;Wait a second, I thought this was a horror game? ...&quot;  . It is. It's a terrifying journey in its own rights, from start to the end. But I can't help it, the  atmosphere  of Amnesia is one of the most, if not the most refined one I have ever witnessed in a video game. The Brennenburg Castle is a truly memorable place. During the first half of the game, you will be exploring the highly architectural, yet haunting chambers, familiarizing yourself with the gameplay mechanics, the story of the main character and the lore. I'm not going to go into lots of detail about the second half, but I'll just summarize this part with a quote that I think fits it best: &quot;All good things come to an end.&quot;, as you will understand what the beautiful castle hides, buried deep within.  The story of  Amnesia: The Dark Descent  does not lack at all in quality, but nor is it the most intriguing or most interesting. However, you may have to give the game a second playthrough to fully understand the lore. You're playing as Daniel, an archaeologist. The plot spawns after Daniel retrieves a strange, mystical orb from a tomb in Algeria. From that moment on, he starts getting nightmares and the people he interacts with end up brutally killed sooner or later, by a strange force. He realizes he's being haunted by this orb and that, in the end, he will end up dead too, so he decides to follow the instructions from a strange letter he recieved, signed by Alexander, baron of Brennenburg. Most of the narrative will be brought to the player by finding notes and bits of Daniel's journal, scattered across the castle, but there are also occasional flashbacks, which will give you an insight into what happened in various places, throughout your journey. Story length's neither too small or big. Expect around 10-15 hours of playtime, if you also want to collect every journal fragment. It's worth noting, though, that this game suffers from the replay value factor. I don't see myself replaying it anytime soon as there's not any content to it besides the main story. Then, you may ask, why do so many people still play this game? The answer lies in the great implementation the devs added to the game: community made maps, aka  custom stories . These are (for the most part) completely new settings created by various people, with new stories and environments (they're made using Amnesia's original assets, so it goes without saying: don't expect something as fresh as a brand new game). There are hundreds upon hundreds of them, fairly easy to find on the Internet and there are also Steam Guides regarding which ones are worth your time, or even how to create your own one!  Let's move on and talk about the sound quality. This is another element where Amnesia shines brightly. Music is fitting and the sound effects are top-notch. The monster's growl will make your skin crawl and when he spots you, a ghastly music will commence. But all in all, when there is nothing dangerous nearby, you will be surrounded by a charming melody, one that immaculately fits the game's vista.  Graphics of this game are quite impressive for such a small team (at that time?). Of course, they cannot compete with big name's engines, but nonetheless Amnesia does look good and the visuals have never been an immersion-breaker. The optimization suffers in certain areas, notably places with many sources of light, where the framedrops tend to flutter. I do not have a beast of a rig, but my specs highly surpass the recommended ones on the store page. It's nothing of a big issue to me, though, and the FPS never dropped below 30.  The gameplay is interesting, to say the least. I don't see often horror titles blending puzzles in such a non-intrusive way, like Amnesia does. The puzzle element is on point here, you will run quite often into trouble, doors needing keys to be unlocked, machinery that needs more power, escaping from narrow areas etc. The monsters are here to give you a hard time and will do their best to stop you from advancing. Unfortunately, one thing I did not like is that, for the most part, the enemies will unrender after a while. Thus, you may find a good place to hide and wait for the beast to just go away... I wish they would patrol the area instead. However, the puzzles are intelligent and non-repetitive. Sometimes, the answer is not as obvious as it seems, or it requires the player to read some notes, advance some more in the story etc. Another unique element here is the &quot;sanity&quot; system. Basically, staying in the dark for too long, looking at the monster or witnessing unexpected events will drain your lucidity, giving Daniel headaches and ultimately hallucinations, collapsing on the ground, allerting the monsters, along with different screen distortions. Always conserve your lantern oil, as most of the game takes place in dark surroundings. An interesting trivia, when your sanity is dangerously low, some elements of the game will change, such as Alexander's portrait on the wall paintings or some corpses appearing in various locations.  The horror aspect is top-notch, rarely has any game made my heart beat this fast when being chased by the enemy. In Amnesia, you have no means of defending yourself. Darkness can be your foe, but also your best friend when it comes to hiding. The monsters are much faster than you, they can break down doors and detect you if you stare at them for too long. They're also very susceptible of sounds, so don't attempt to run past them without being seen. And under the worst circumstances, you have to make a run for the nearest chamber and lock yourself inside, alternatively using elements from the environment to block the monster from reaching you.    Summary:     Pros:   + Magnificent atmosphere, the Castle of Brennenburg is a spot that will stick with players for a long time; + Great and interesting puzzles, with original solutions; + Immersive music and sounds, mixing ambient noises with heart-pumping melody, accordingly; + Engaging storyline, may call for a 2nd playthrough in order to fully comprehend it; + Terrifying horror element, you are completely defenseless in front of the monsters, they can chase you down relatively quick and kill you in a small number of hits; + Unique system of Health+Sanity, in Amnesia you also have to take care of your brain status; witnessing unexpected events, staying in the darkness for too long will drag your sanity down and you will eventually collapse; + Difficulty is balanced, the game will not throw its most dangerous enemies at the player until he's prepared to face them; + Tons of user-made custom stories, that keep this game's player base alive and bring new, different concepts;    Neutral:   +/- The lantern runs out of oil pretty fast, which might prove to be a bother for new players, leaving them facing the darkness for a long time; +/- Dying has no real consequences; the game saves quite often and it will spawn you back in a safe chamber, along with the items you have retrieved;    Cons:   - No replay value; after you understood the storyline, there's no real point in coming back to it (besides the custom stories, of course); - Monsters disappear after a while, which massively takes away from the challenge factor; - Occasional bugs and glitches, aswell as sound stutterings;   Amnesia: The Dark Descent  is a king of horror genre and, by far, Frictional's peak game. Ultimately, we need more games like this.    Personal rating:   97/100 - Masterpiece 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Eludium/recommended/391720,1, The only regret I have after finishing  Layers of Fear  is that I won't be able to experience the game like the first time I played it, ever again. It was a memorable journey, which, even though admittedly short, was worth every cent.  You play as a painter who's gone insane over his obsession with perfection in his works of art. Through the story you'll recall memories that surrounded him and his family and how his profession completely changed his world, his attitude etc. While the narration is not particularly mind-blowing, it's the events which happen throughout player progression that mainly consolidate the story. The game is split in a prologue and six chapters, all of them happening around the spectrum of your  magnum opus , a new masterpiece you're working on. As you are progressing through the narrative you will understand how the plot takes a darker turn with each new chapter.  In regards to the genre, I can firmly say that  Layers of Fear  does a fantastic job at bringing suspense and fright to the player. There is no combat, and dying will not have you reload an older checkpoint (though it will lead to a different ending). Instead, most of the horror is brought to you by the uncertain and the jump scares. Indeed, the game is filled with them, but in my opinion they make the game a lot better. Sure, many people may disagree with me here. I am not a fan of cheap, clich¨¦-ish jump scares either, and that's exactly why I loved them in  Layers of Fear : they're different. It's difficult to explain exactly how they work without spoiling the game. In short, they're much more than random meshes thrown at you. It feels like they're building the story in their own way.  The gameplay is the standard one usually encountered in games of this sort: you walk/run across the rooms, interacting with the environment in order to progress or to uncover memories of the protagonist's past. You can not defend yourself from the enemy, but there's only a few encounters with them, all of which can be avoided as well.  The graphics are absolutely top-notch and a notable feat both from the development team and the Unity engine. Many times I stopped from advancing in the game only to stare at the paintings on the walls, or at the attention to detail in various scenarios. It is definitely a visual gem, which immensely adds to the immersion factor and overall to an even greater atmosphere.  The sound design is purely a masterpiece. Being an audiophile, I paid attention all the time to the background noises and music.   The sound effects are very well polished and in harmony with the pace of the game. The wind and the trees outside, the lights cutting out, whispers of the past etc. all make up for the horror ambiance.   The voice acting, while not distinctly catchy, is not half bad. Most of it will be heard when the player finds a memento, so it's not intrusive in any way.   The soundtrack is astounding and one of the main reasons I replayed the game multiple times. Immersive melodies accompanying the player, with changing themes depending on the scenario.   It is worth saying that  Layers of Fear  is an incredibly atmospheric game, mainly because of the aforementioned graphics and sound quality, but also thanks to the incredible level design set by the developers. It's a game playing with your brain, the rooms changing their appearance as you trigger certain events, returning to some places only to find them completely different etc. , delivering the player a taste of the painter's madness.    Summary:     Pros:   + Unique, memorable,  true  horror experience, amplified by a dark story line, breathtaking visuals and exceptional sound effects; + An atmosphere unseen before, with an interesting level design concept (interiors changing as the player looks back etc.), living up to its title of &quot;psychological horror&quot;; + Marvelous soundtrack and totally immersive audio effects; + Gorgeous graphics; + The story is mostly built by the world elements the players can interact with, never enforcing cutscenes; + In my 20 hours of playtime I don't recall encountering a single glitch, let alone game breaking bugs;    Cons:   - No replayability; I, for one, have finished the game multiple times in order to better understand the story (and to get the remaining achievements); - The fact that dying only affects the ending and has no real consequences during gameplay kills a certain amount of the tension;  - While not a big issue, I feel like the game could've been longer, as it took me roughly 5-6 hours to finish it on my first playthrough;    Personal rating:    91/100 - Amazing    *Review of the &quot;Inheritance&quot; DLC can be found  here .  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Eludium/recommended/284950,1, Pixel Puzzles is a fun little game to kill time with. There is a handful of puzzles and completing them will unlock greater difficulty ones, as well as a level increase to your profile (the ranking is only ''to be''; it won't affect your gameplay experience in any way). As you may guess from the title, this is a Japan-focused game in the ''Pixel Puzzles'' series. Thus, all puzzles are set in a japanese landscape. However, as simple and relaxing this game may sound, there is a very annoying bug when picking up puzzle pieces. It's usually never the piece you click on, but the one nearby. I don't consider this a game-breaking bug but it can be very frustrating at puzzzles with hundreds of pieces, where you can barely pick them up. Not to mention, there is no ''Save'' function. If you've embarked on a 300 pieces puzzle, you need to either stay there for an hour or two and finish it, or  remember  the pieces' position. This is because the screenshotting option is disabled in this game. The game only has one, repetitive song during puzzles. I ended up muting the game and playing my own music in the bakground, I recommend you do the same.    Pros:   + Fun and relaxing game, excellent to pass time with; + Puzzles with different difficulty levels which are unlocked as you complete easier ones; +the hint system is balanced, so players won't spam it;    Neutral:   +/- The ranking system is only there to fill the game with a new element; it doesn't do anything, but some players may like seeing the monk leveling up after completing puzzles;    Cons:   - Picking up the piece you want is a pain; they are always moving in the background and cursor will pick up another one; - Only one, repetitive soundtrack; -Missing save button;  Buy it while it's on sale if you're into the casual genre, you won't regret it.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116527414/recommended/405640,1, Deus ex machina? More like 'diabolus in machina'!  This game was a short, but very stimulating experience for me. I laughed, I was confused, I had to think hard about the puzzles, and in the end, I was left pondering over all the intertwined &quot;levels&quot; of meaning those highly gifted developers lead me through.   It becomes clear quite early, so I think I don't spoil anything by describing some of those levels: You, the player, are a real person sitting in front of your PC. You run this game. In the game, you play a protagonist using an arcade machine (coloured 3D graphics) - and you may or may not learn from flashbacks later in the game who &quot;you&quot; actually are. The arcade machine presents a game named &quot;Pony Island&quot;, a 2D-scroller with a character that is called a pony all the time, but looks like a unicorn (black and white retro graphics). It turns out that this game is not here to entertain you, but to punish you - you go through the hell of maliciously amateurish game-design, game-breaking bugs and crashes - and to steal your soul. In order to escape, you have to enter and manipulate the code of the arcade game (text and symbol based puzzles)... You see how many meta-levels are built around one another here, making you wonder what you put your heart and soul into as a passionate gamer.  My point is: Don't be fooled by screenshots of the arcade game! It might look like a cheap and boring indie production at first glance, but this is actually a deliberate design choice within a very intelligent, self-aware, self-ironic, even self-deconstructive game of unique charm. What they did with the third boss (and the fourth wall) was pure genius, a moment I will not forget as long as I am active on Steam.  I will say no more, except: 8.5/10! 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116527414/recommended/490100,1, This is one of those two-dimensional puzzle games you can find by the dozens here, a brain-teaser with neat abstract objects and increasing difficulty that keeps you busy for a few hours.  It has more features on the board than some of its competitors. Also, the whole presentation is aesthetically pleasing, and so I can give the game a thumbs-up.  I do have a small problem with the advertisement though: This is not &quot;the embodiment of relaxation&quot; or &quot;an unforgettable journey&quot;, in fact it is not special at all. There are just some meditation-related buzzwords like &quot;tranquility&quot; and &quot;zen&quot; as well as pseudo-literary texts (that are completely unrelated to the actual game) thrown in, and the very good sound design includes soothing background music. You can achieve the exact same effect by playing one of the many other similar logic games and run your favourite relaxation playlist in a separate app. Still, the ad tries to suggest to you that this game would be something unique, selling you a feeling instead of a product in a quite transparent and pretentious manner. This does not mean that Quell Zen was somehow worse - but it surely is not better than the others the way it claims to be. I felt that this needed to be said. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116527414/recommended/341000,1,  The idea  What a brilliant concept to offer gamers a simulation of the gaming industry, making sure that every player has a positive emotional connection to the virtual goods he deals with - games are fun! I know this one is not the first to use the idea, but it is an advantage nevertheless in comparison with other simulations that take you into a cookshop or a truck cabin. At least for me, it worked very well.    The game  Visuals and music do not show that this is an indie production at all - it is all well done, in the bright and cheerful spirit of Sims 3. You can even play dollhouse by choosing and positioning furniture until everything is perfect, but this is optional. Just like for many other things like repeated tasks, you can choose automation and grouping functions for that and avoid tedious micromanagement if you don't care for that. Like all tycoon games, this one gets repetitive anyway after a while because you just amass more and more money by doing similar things. However, this one is superior to others because of the historically accurate technological progress from 1980-2018 that gradually unlocks more and more features and increases complexity, until you can really feel the effort of years of development and cooperation of four or five different departments until a big AAA title can be released to the market - and receive its ratings.     My journey  Getting a perfect review, making a 100 % perfect game that gives my customers a good time, that was the lifetime dream I started with when I built my first little office next door to my garage. I studied new inventions, I struggled with my bank loans, I hired more and more staff (gamers and nerds like me whom I could very well have befriended in a real-life situation like that) - and together we grew bigger and more respected in the industry, until one day, I finally achieved my first 100 % score. It felt amazing! After that, game development lost a lot of its appeal, but I could choose a completely different path: I made money, as much as I could, by doing contract work for other companies and creating MMOs - my biggest title was online 20 years and earned me 12 billion dollars! And with those riches, I bought out all my competitors and made them produce games for my very own gaming console, making it market leader eventually - while I sat back, drank my coffee and watched the cash flow in. This was my journey in this game, and even though it lasted only 20 hours, I found this virtual life experience to be very memorable.   Verdict  The game is still in development (updated regularly), and it still has some little flaws. But in the end, they did not bother me that much. I am very satisfied and give Mad Games Tycoon a 7.5/10. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116527414/recommended/376870,-1, This product fails both as an interactive movie and as a Minecraft spin-off.   Minecraft?  I love the original Minecraft, I played it for more than 1,500 hours. What I love most there is the freedom of creativity, and for that, I was willing to accept the lack of refined graphics and roleplay in NPC dialogues. This so-called &quot;Story Mode&quot; keeps the blocky graphics (not in a game engine, that could have been spectacular - it is all drawn), but it takes away your freedom of movement and interaction with the environment completely, you folllow strictly limited corridors and obediently press buttons that are prompted to you on the screen or execute very obvious point-and-click set-ups. Building tasks are just recorded sequences that you go through by repeatedly hammering the same button a few times. Occasional puzzles and crafting tasks are so simple that a six-year-old could solve them with ease.    Story?  The dialogues are voice acted in decent quality. That said, they are slow, dumb and predictable, just like the story itself. Telltale is allegedly specialized on interactive movies like that, but they did not even get the technical basics right: The time to make your choice in a dialogue is limited, and the NPC keeps on talking while your time runs out, which means you have to listen to what he or she says, read what you could respond and think about which option would fit best with your character at the same time - really distracting! From time to time, the last word of the player character gets cut off; no idea wether this was bad audio editing or a performance issue. Anyway, neither the story itself nor the presentation made me happy. Is this supposed to be a cartoon for little children? That would explain a lot, but it was not advertised as such.  I will not get into that widely discussed issue with the final chapters of the story coming out as paid DLC - I could not even play beyond the second chapter (of eight in total) anyway because it was so painfully boring.   Verdict and recommendations  3.5/10 - not only is this not a good game, this is not a game at all. It is an overpriced and dull animated movie with Minecraft assets, constantly interrupted by short interactive sequences that are neither exciting nor fun. (For example, in more than one case you have to walk around 10 steps between two scripted scenes - this is not immersively interactive, this is just annoying.)  If you want a real Minecraft story mode, get one of those adventures written by modders, who set some parts of the environment as indestructible, but otherwise tell a story while still letting you play an actual game. If you are interested in the story that is told here, save your money and watch a walkthrough or LP online, but even if you won't: You do not miss out on much. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116527414/recommended/247020,1, Gordon Ramsay made me do it! - Seriously, I have played so many video games about killing people, killing animals, killing monsters, that it is nice to play a good game like this about sustaining life for a change.   Gameplay  The advertisement for this game focusses on it being a restaurant simulator. However, the business simulation part is a bit shallow: You can buy recipes and upgrade them, and after 20 days (and accomplishing some specific tasks), you get a new star for your restaurant. You can also spend money on cooking devices that unlock new recipes and other features that increase your time limits in the kitchen, or boost the &quot;buzz&quot;, effectively the number of customer orders. Yet, you never buy raw ingredients, you do not hire any staff (even in a five-star-restaurant, you still cook, clean and serve everything on your own), you do not buy any visible pieces of furniture and position them strategically... the background for the UI is always static. The developer focussed more on the cooking itself than on restaurant management simulation, and this makes it more of a skill game.  I call it a skill game because you win it by &quot;cooking&quot; fast and precisely. You can do it with your mouse, clicking on every ingredient and triggering phases of preparation all with your index finger; but in my experience, it is more efficient and ergonomical to learn the key-bindings by heart. You have to press a letter for each ingredient and other keys for certain acts of preparation, and if you can type those &quot;codes&quot; fluently (e.g. vegetarian lasagna: &quot;PSVCR PSVCR PSCR&quot;), using all your fingers and without even looking at the ingredient list on the screen, you have a massive advantage. Fortunately, there is the option to practice every dish with an &quot;official taste tester&quot; before you put the item on your active menu and present it to real customers, and I recommend making extensive use of that option.  Now, isn't cooking and keeping the restaurant clean like work? Yes, it is. This game actually feels like work. BUT it is rewarding work: The voice-acted reactions of your customers when you serve a perfect meal (&quot;M-hm! Hey-ey-ey!&quot;), the balloons falling under loud applause when you receive a new star, or the successful participation in contests like the Iron Cook Challenges or in the dating programme Cook4Luv provide many opportunities to get acknowledgement for your hard efforts, and this makes Cook, Serve, Delicous! so addictive. Also, the successes and failures are always your own: If you do everything right, the customer will be happy. If you make a mistake, the customer will always notice. It is very fair, and after a bad day, you are motivated to train more and get better. The difficulty increases not so much with the upgrades of the restaurant (with the familiar five-star-system), but with the upgrades for the dishes, that become more and more complex, while simple items (like beer) always stay that way; that means that you can always adapt your own difficulty by choosing a more or less demanding selection of items on your menu of the day.   Presentation  The graphics and sound effects are simple, but somehow still appetizing. I focussed on Italian and American cuisine, and after every two hours or so, I had to take a break because I became hungry...   The music on the other hand was not to my liking: The title song with the repeated &quot;Cook!&quot;, &quot;Serve!&quot;, &quot;Delicious!&quot; in different overacted voices was almost annoying, and the repetitive background music is played in a modernistic style I did not enjoy - I switched the music off completely after a short while. I would have preferred if you could have chosen a type of restaurant (Italian food, Mexican food, sea food), and got the corresponding backgrounds and music. I consider this a missed opportunity on the developer's part.   Value for money  It takes around 10-15 hours to complete the game once. You can add replayability by specializing in different kinds of food, choosing higher difficulty settings and even engaging in a competitive multiplayer mode called Battle Kitchen- which I have not tried yet. All in all, there is a lot to do, and the game is worth its price.   Verdict  The presentation of the game can make you underestimate it: It has a very intense gameplay and can give you massive feeling of accomplishment. Also, it trains you mentally to stay calm while multitasking under pressure, a very useful ability. 7.5/10. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116527414/recommended/200710,1, Every once in a while, I love to smash everything and everyone in sight - then I turn to a something like Torchlight II. Hack &amp; Slay is the name of the game, and it feels just as satisfying as the rich booty from those battles. The enemies and surroundings are diverse enough, and some bosses look relatively awesome. I say &quot;relatively&quot; because overall, the graphics have not aged well. On the other hand, the music is still excellent. Dialogues are short and do not involve any important decisions or moral dilemmas, which is an advantage because the voice acting is mostly sub-par.   Grim Dawn is superior in this regard and managed to create a lot more depth of atmosphere (e.g. the Steampunk setting with fireweapons side by side with swords and maces is more plausible in a post-apocalyptic scenario - Torchlight does not bother with giving you that kind of background). Also, it is four years younger and has better graphics. If in doubt which one you should play, I would prefer Grim Dawn.   Nevertheless, Torchlight II is well done, it offers consistently engaging gameplay and character progression as well as several options for you to keep on playing after finishing the main story. The feature that you can use your pet as a connection to town markets is not realistic, but innovative and conveniently saves your hero some annoyingly repetitive errands, which is why I make this honorary mention here.   I recommend this game to fans of the genre and give it a 7/10 in this comparison group. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116527414/recommended/364470,1, Legends is the new free-to-play collectible card game in the Fantasy universe of The Elder Scrolls by Zenimax/Bethesda, produced by the experienced strategy card game developer Dire Wolf Digital.   Gameplay  Instead of explaining the rules systematically in their entirety, which you can read about elsewhere, I will point out some differences to the model archetype of the genre, Magic: The Gathering, which I used to play both with real cards and online in the past.   In general, deck building and duels are the major aspects of the game in both cases. Also, both ESL and MTG Online offer the alternatives of casual and tournament battles against real players or a competent AI. However, ESL adds stories that form the framework of series of AI battles, one of which comes with the base game and one (?Dark Brotherhood¡°) can be obtained with real or ingame currency. I did not find the stories incredibly interesting, they give you good bonus cards though. Additionally, you can choose a profile picture from a lore-friendly selection, connected with a certain voice and way to express yourself during a battle. You receive rewards and card upgrades from ?levelling up¡° by collecting game experience, and your chosen race determines what kinds of creatures you are likely to receive this way - a nice touch for all those RPG fans who flock to ESL coming from Skyrim or The Elder Scrolls Online. So far, ESL offers slightly more than the genre dinosaur.   With regard to deck building, I have to mention that in ESL, there is no free card market like in MTGO, where I spent quite some time and real money to get the rare cards I needed for a competitive deck, and that was full of ugly bots as well. Instead, you can break down cards to receive gems, that can be used to buy cards, a simple and clean process and the reason why it is to be labelled as a collectible card game rather than a trading card game.  The developers of ESL also prevented abuse and spam by replacing the formerly common free ingame chat (as you can use in MTGO) with a selection of eight verbal expressions, like ?Hello¡° or ?Good game¡°, which are voice acted according to your chosen profile character (see above). Even though this is somehow restrictive, I think it is an intelligent solution to a common problem in all multiplayer games. I found these ?verbal emoticons¡° to be quite sufficient to have basic and polite human interaction. You can still invite your friends from real life or from Steam if they tell you their Bethesda account name in order to play with them, which of course means you can use other chat channels for a nice conversation while you play ESL in a small window.  The most welcome feature in ESL that makes it impossible for me to enjoy MTGO ever again is the rune mechanic: As you lose health, ?runes¡° are broken one after the other, which lets you draw additional cards and in some cases (?prophecies¡°) even play them instantly and without spending magicka. This creates a balancing effect to the benefit of a losing player and makes the game dynamic more interesting. It also makes the attacker think twice before dealing minor damage to his opponent that just might give him a tactical option that could turn the game in his favour.  In ESL, the ?battlefield¡° is limited in space, usually to eight creatures in total. In MTG, there is no such restriction, and more than once, I have been beaten by insane combos giving the opponent opportunity to summon infinite numbers of weak creatures who then overwhelmed my forces, which I did not enjoy. In fact, I quit MTG because of such auto-win combo decks, which made the whole game kind of pointless: Either they got it and won instantly, or they did not and lost, my own efforts did not really matter; not so here.  The magical resource that lets you summon troops and perform other actions is obtained in completely different ways. In MTG, you have to play land cards that give you mana every turn. This necessity means that approximately half your deck consists of land cards, most of which are quite bland and boring. In ESL, magicka is gained every turn without such lands, and your magicka pool is increased automatically. This has two effects: One, deck building is more interesting without such bland basic cards. Two, the battle escalates more dynamically, you cannot get stuck with good cards, but no resource to use them because you had bad luck with the distribution of land cards.  You have almost complete freedom in how to build your deck, however, focussing on a certain race of Tamriel has advantages, as you can gain buffs specific cards can give each other. Each race implicates its own playstyle: Imperials rely on collective buffs and numbers, Redguards mostly benefit from weapon and armor item cards, Argonians increase their magicka pool more quickly... Those playstyles and the free combinations of tactical choices guarantee a good variety of gameplay.   Until now, I have not become bored with regard to the outcome of the duels either. Even after making a lot of efforts to optimize my deck, I win three out of five games in average. Either the different common deck builds are that well balanced, or the player matchmaking process has been improved since the early reviews that complained about this aspect.    Presentation  The graphics and the voice acting are of the same high quality as TES V. They even reused some of the voice actors (e.g. General Tullius' voice for the card ?Scouting Patrol¡°; the voice for the card ?General Tullius¡° proper is female, which slightly confused me until I remembered Legate Rikke who might give orders in the general's name ¨C just one example of how true this game is to the Elder Scrolls lore).  As you would expect, graphical and sound effects are designed to make you become addicted to the game. That's OK with me, as I am a gaming addict anyway, and it is done competently.  The stories are told in largely static images, which is not what I would wish for, but I understand that a free-to-play product can only use a limited budget for such a secondary part of the game.    Value for money  The game is completely free. You can use real money to buy card packs and a storyline expansion, but even that is not necessary. You get random cards from winning duels, which you can exchange for those you need at a rate between 10:1 (common cards) and 4:1 (legendary cards), and the Dark Brotherhood story can be bought with ingame gold ¨C which I achieved within three weeks of casual activity. I have not spent a dime on ESL, and I got a lot of fun out of it.   Verdict  This game is a very nice addition to this legendary franchise. Building my Imperial deck inspired me to play Skyrim's Civil War questline once again. Apart from that, it can hold its head high among competitors of the same genre. According to my bias in favour of the Elder Scrolls universe, I call it an 8/10.     EDIT: Pay to win?  With &quot;Heroes of Skyrim&quot; out, rumours have spread that ESL would be pay-to-win now, which is complete nonsense:  1. Those cards were distributed for free on expansion release, a 50 cards pack for everyone and then, for a whole week, you could get HoS cards for free via daily quests, 18 per day. You didn't have to pay, you didn't even have to win, just attack opponents 30 times over an unlimited number of duels. Basically, HoS was given away. 2. If you got into the game later, you can still buy HoS packs with ingame gold, and single cards with regular gems, without any money involved. If you want to use dragons and shouts, just - get them and play. 3. HoS is not as overpowered as some sore losers want to make it seem. You can beat those decks with pre-expansion builds if your synergies are optimized. I do not see a p2w situation at this point.  The game continues to be fun for a completely free account such as mine, therefore the update does not change my rating.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116527414/recommended/403950,1, I like the game, but I am not excited about it.    Presentation  The graphics are pretty basic for a game of 2016 and the fourth instalment in a series. The two-dimensional top-down views both on the map and in battle are functional and consistent, but as unimpressive as the 20 years old Civilization 2 after playing Civ6. No cutscenes, no character portraits, no animations at all. Sound effects are sparse as well. The background music is nice though.   Gameplay  The gameplay is accessible and easy to understand: Conquer resources, levy troops and hire commanders, defeat enemies - repeat. The depth of strategy is based on the procedurally generated maps and the bandwidth of different factions you can play, and that latter one is indeed a big plus. A baron with his knights and crossbowmen actually plays differently from a druid who uses the powers of nature. I don't mind little flaws - e.g. I did not understand how a single wild deer could prevent a whole village from yielding taxes until you conquer it a second time. I do mind that the AI does very stupid things occasionally, but I have yet to see a strategy game where this is not the case, so this is forgivable.  A big minus, however, is the fact that you do not get to command your troops in battle. This feature, or rather lack of features, was the biggest disappointment for me. It all plays out automatically, with a step-by-step battle report on the side (which impairs my immersion, because it is stat-related and technical). You cannot even give basic commands like &quot;retreat&quot; or &quot;defensive stance&quot;. Neither can you influence the battle formation, and in large armies, that can lead to archers being useless because your own ranks in front of them prevent enemies from getting into shooting range. Maybe, the developer wanted to spare the player too much micromanagement, but this could have easily been solved by making such interventions optional. Also, I do not understand why castles and watchtowers are all represented exactly the same. At least, you don't have to watch every skirmish play out, but can increase speed or skip to the final result, which I ended up doing regularly after an hour.   Verdict  This quite decent retro indie game does not actually offer a lot of production value, but it manages to stimulate your imagination to make up narratives while you experience a minimalistic strategy game with an exceptional variety of different units. 6.5/10. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/corvusblack/recommended/20900,1, The first game of an awesome franchise.  Sadly, this is the game most players overlooked, mostly due to combat system. Yes it is weird, it is not practical. It is like a rhythm game to be honest. However if you bear with it at get used to the game, it shines like a diamond.   The story is mostly stand alone, not that much related to second and third games. But that doesn't mean that is should be overlooked. It is a game of politics and human nature.  Let me talk about combat system. As I have said, it is like a rhythm game. Click to attack an enemy and click again when game tells you to chain up your attacks and perform combos. Parrying is automatic, performed according to your skills. You have two swords, steel one for humans and &quot;normal&quot; beasts (such as dogs, wolves) and silver one for all kinds of monsters (vampires, necrophages, etc.). And you have three styles for each sword (strong, fast and group styles). Strong style deals heavy damage is used for slow, heavily armored opponents. Strong style also have a chance to cause bleeding that gradually decreases health, much like a poison. Fast style is used for fast enemies and have a chance to cause pain status effect which is like a stun. Group style is the situational one. It causes less damage than the other two, but critical hit chance increases as you fight 3 or more enemies. With certain skills, group style causes knockdown which makes enemies incredibly vulnerable to instant kills.  You can craft bombs, potions and blade oils by alchemy system to have an edge at the combat. There are potions that increase health regen, increase endurance regen (that is used to cast signs, more on that later), increase damage you deal at the cost of making dodge and parry impossible, etc. The downside of the potions is that all potions have a toxicity level. High toxicity level causes adverse effects, such as health damage.  Blade oils, when applied to a blade (duh), causes the blade to deal more damage, according to the oil used. You can craft oils that are effective against specific types of enemies such as vampires, spectres, necrophages and you can craft oils that are situational, causing status effects like bleeding and pain.   You can also craft bombs to help you in combat. There are various types of bombs that causes fire damage, blinding, stunning, poisoning. They are useful, but they are not absolutely necessary to beat the game.  There are also signs, spells that you can cast on the go to have and advantage on the battle. You have aard (think of force push from Star Wars) that causes stun and knockback, igni which causes damage and delivers incineration status effect to enemies, quen which forms a protective shield around you that blocks damage, axi which hexes enemies, stunning them or even converting to your side, and finally yrden which places a trap on the ground that damages enemies and delivers status effects.    Now, I beat the game on hard difficulty and here are my experiences:  -Axi and yrden signs are useless. I never used them. Quen is situational. It can give you time you need to throw a bomb or drink a potion. Mostly throughout the game you will use aard and igni.  -Blade oils are essential in hard difficulty. Be sure to have several different kinds in your inventory to cover all enemies you encounter.  -Bombs are cool, but they are not absolutely necessary.   -You'll have lots of potions to drink, but mostly you'll use swallow (health regen), tawny owl (endurance regen)  and cat (see in darkness - you'll encounter many caves/crypts). Be warned that swallow is not a regular health potion, it just increases the regeneration rate so it can be useless against enemies that deal lots of damage in short time. If you want instant health, you'll need white raffard's decoction, but take care drinking it because it is highly toxic.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/seph_au/recommended/680390,1,  https://youtu.be/bXIMkQAOKpo  Excellent action rpg thus far. Triple audio with decent voicework and subtitles (english/chinese/japanese), 4k/60fps. Interesting story and characters which are split between chapters that end with a boss fight. New weapons and collectables are spread throughout levels for some replay value. Killing enemies and opening hidden chests also drop orbs that are get used to upgrade skillsets. Tight controls and very approachable combo system which caters to both beginners and veterans, unfortunately controls cannot be remapped so I would suggest using a gamepad. Easy recommendation to fans of games like Strider or action platformer/metroidvania fans in general. Cheers. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/corvusblack/recommended/234650,1, This game was a suprise for me. I did not now about Shadowrun universe before, and i was kind of dumbstruck about the setting. Think DnD with cyberpunk. This alone made me buy this game, and this beauty did not disappoint me.   Combat is like the X-COM Enemy Within. Not detailed as much but still, enjoyable. The campaign is interesting (though not as much as dragonfall) and you can download more campaigns through steam workshop. There are many campaigns there and some of them are very, very good. Have I mentioned the setting is ????ing awesome?  This is an awesome game and it deserves it's pricetag. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/seph_au/recommended/552520,-1, Billion dollar company forces 2bit malware (easyanticheat) for noncompetitive singleplayer/coop game. Thought they would have learnt something after adding to watchdogs 2 and getting yelled at by the community who forced them to introduce a method of play that didn't require it. Unfortunately Ubisoft is still lacking any common sense, -eac_launcher does not work for Far Cry 5 and game just spits the dummy removing files. Suggestion, if your friends cheat and it bothers you, get new friends. Can you please stop forcing me to install backdoor trojans to play another overpriced reskin. ty kindly. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116527414/recommended/72850,1, This is my favourite fantasy RPG, despite all of its little flaws - the freedom of movement, quest choices and role-play options is unmatched by any of its competitors as far as I know. The variety of activities as well as the depth of lore is simply inspiring. Some people wrote that the predecessor Oblivion was a better RPG - I played both, and I disagree. The good things of Oblivion are included in Skyrim, but the graphics and gameplay have been improved greatly.  I literally spent weeks of my lifetime in Skyrim with several playthroughs: I was - a Cyrodiilic vagabond who got caught by border patrol and almost executed on suspicion of treason, but miraculously saved and personally impressed by a Nord officer in the ranks of the Imperial army. I enlisted as a recruit, took part in the civil war in the province and went from a lightly armed ranger to a distinguished officer in priceless heavy plate, a one-man-army roaming the land and destroying anyone and anything that threatens the peaceful subjects of the Emperor in defiance of His laws - all while entertaining a passionate interest in Dwarven ruins and artifacts. - a Reachman from Markarth who got himself into a conflict with organised crime, had to flee from the city and learn how to survive in the wilderness, became a werewolf and follower of Hircine, the Daedric Prince of the Hunt. Hunting animals, highwaymen and soldiers of the Imperial and Thalmor occupation force proved to be the mere training phase for the real &quot;game&quot;: giants, legendary dragons and vampire lords became my prey and worthy sacrifices for my Daedric Master. - a Dark Elf from Morrowind who wandered to the ruins of Winterhold to study at the famous college there, become a master of alchemy and destruction magic, compare strength with ancient and powerful dragonpriests and collect souls for his mistress Azura. - an Argonian worker from Windhelm who had enough of discrimination and daily humiliation by the Nords, made his way to Riften and became a member of the Thieves guild, was then abducted by the Dark Brotherhood and forced into their service - which they regretted when facing their utter destruction. Yet, I felt my soul had been corrupted by the thought of gaining power exploiting others even down to their lives, and given the choice, I became a vampire and terrorized the land with my growing abilities, amassing incredible wealth.  These are only a few examples of the stories that I invented and experienced playing this game, and for giving me the material to incite my imagination in this intensity, I am grateful to Bethesda and forgive them all the bugs that occasionally occurred.  I give this game a heartfelt 9,9/10. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/shak69/recommended/272350,1, Great game, amazing tree style guns and percs like cod, a bit slower at combat and have coldowns for atacks after running etc. still a pretty good game 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116527414/recommended/33580,1,   Compatibility  First of all, I ran this remake on a Win10 PC with a NVIDIA GTX 745, and neither did I have problems starting the game nor did it crash once during my 2 hours (short) playthrough.   Remake nostalgia  I enjoyed it very much. During the late 80s, I played the original Vermeer on my Schneider CPC6128. I was pleasantly surprised  about this rejuvenated version, its neat graphics, the nicely executed intro and the stylish background music (one for each city you can travel to). Everyone who shares my aforementioned experience with the original should have a fresh look. Gamers who do not have this predisposition for nostalgia might find the game a little simplistic, but it feels quite relaxing nevertheless.   Gameplay  The goal is to collect famous paintings to please your wealthy uncle, competing with some of your relatives (AI or hotseat multiplayer) for his inheritance. Most of those pieces of art are bought in auction houses all over Europe and the USA, and in order to do that, you need to earn money as a planter in Asia, Africa and the Americas, grow five different crops (tea, coffee, cacao, tobacco as well as silk) and sell them on commodity markets in London and New York. Forward contracts with higher profits, stock exchange, special events and expeditions to exotic places spice up this routine between simple economic simulation and educational collect quest. During the short game, it did not become boring. I am not sure how it would feel to play the long version in one session though.   I did not encounter any bugs. It seemed a little confusing at first when the amount of my available funds was automatically increased or decreased (when I ran into debt, the game decided for me that I needed to take a higher bank loan), and the rules what you can and cannot buy when your cash runs out are a little arbitrary (crop transfer yes, plantation upgrades no, worker wages yes, expeditions no...) - coming from the original game where you could not even buy a train ticket without a positive cash balance, I understand that the developers of the remake wanted to avoid the (formerly common) situation that the player got stuck in the middle of nowhere, waiting for a random money gift from your uncle for travel expenses.  I cannot write this review without mentioning the beautiful replicas of the paintings and their informative descriptions you can read by inspecting them. I love it when a game has some real-life educational value in addition to the good entertainment.   Verdict  The original classic has been modernized and presented in a very appealing way. The game is stable, and it is not expensive. I give it a 7.5/10 and recommend it to Vermeer veterans, friends of the simulation genre who want to try something not too complicated, and to culture vultures who appreciate the art theme. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116527414/recommended/328760,-1, As a millenial, I was astonished about the detailed pictures you can get out of ASCII symbols. The music is not bad either.  Those positive things said, this game does not feel good to me. As you do not see any moving sprites, it is naturally very much focussed on text and numbers, which means reading all the time (of course without voice acting). The omnipresence of stat numbers makes the combat and world exploration quite abstract and static. As this kind of technology cannot possibly win you over on a visual level, the writing could have been the means to create some kind of atmosphere. Unfortunately, the creators missed this opportunity, making an attempt on a weird surrealistic humour that did not make me laugh once (Pony Island was much cleverer in my opinion). Even worse, it destroys the immersion again and again, and you should not do that in an RPG unless you are really talented in writing self-ironic and fourth-wall-breaking scripts.  It is interesting to try out new and old concepts as alternatives to the modern mainstream, but there is a reason why ASCII-interfaces are not used anymore. Sorry - 3/10 from me.
