https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/234330/,1, Second update based on R78 build (Season 16 timeframe).  The updates since R74 have resolved the PvP portion of the game.  PvP match-ups are now working quite a bit better.  The PvE portion of the game has also improved by giving better opportunities for mid-tier heroes (i.e. not maxed out) to be successful in the overall standings.  I have also noticed the max lives has increased to 10 (from 5).  I'm not sure if that is temporary or not, but that change enables someone to play extended gaming sessions without having to wait to get more lives which should enable new folks to enjoy the game more as they develop their characters. ----- Previously posted negative update: Update based on R74 build (Season 13 timeframe).  The recent changes to the game have made the pvp portion of the game impossible for anyone that does not have a maxed out team.  Previously, the match-ups were based on the number of points you had in the event and you could spend some good gaming time in each event.  Now, after 1-2 battles, your team will face maxed or nearly maxed teams making pvp impossible for players that have not maxed their heroes out (i.e. pay to improve them).  This was a very unfortuante design change that will likely kill off participation in this game. ----- Previously posted positive review: Review based on R55 build (Season 3-4 timeframe).  Marvel Puzzel Quest is fun, casual game similar to the other Puzzle Quest &quot;match-3&quot; type of games with characters from the Marvel Universe.  Like the earlier Puzzle Quest games, there is an added element of strategy on the matches you make based on the strengths of your team of 3 heroes and the strengths of the opposing team.  Although it seems simple in concept, this game is just as addicting as the previous versions of Puzzle Quest.   On the negative side for folks just starting out is the &quot;countdown&quot; timer for your characters to &quot;heal.&quot;  This isn't as big of a deal later on when you have more characters or if you play the game in short periods of time (~30 minutes).    A common question on the Free-to-Play games is whether or not they are Pay-to-Win.  Puzzle Quest can be done without paying anything if you follow a couple of guidelines.    First, you have to accept being limited to a smaller number of characters (known as covers).  If you want more covers early, then an in-game purchase is likely needed ($5-$20 depending on how many characters you want).  Second, if you are new to the game, you are not going to finish high in the rankings on the special events (Lightning Round, Simulator, Seasons).  That will take time to level up your characters or some in-game purchases to level up faster.   Third, be patient.  If you spend all your &quot;healing&quot; and want to keep playing, an in-game purchase is needed.  If you are patient, then the characters eventually get back to full strength an no purchase is necessary.  Bottom line is that this is a fun game that can be played for free.  In my opinion based, the game does provide enough entertainment and gameplay to justify an in-game purchase or two ($5-$20). 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/465650/,1, OOTP18 is the latest version of a great baseball simulator.  I noticed two significant changes from OOTP16 (last version that I owned).  First, the 3D view of the game.  Pervious versions that I played was basically text-only with minimal graphical reflections of the action.  This addition is a very nice touch and aligns with the play-by-play text that is presented.  Since I tend to play all the games (not sim), I have enjoyed this feature much  more than I would have thought.  Another little nuance that I thought was great is after a completed game, there is a nice recap of the game along with player &quot;quotes&quot; and a probability of winning line as the game progressed.  The other significant change that I found is the new &quot;challenge mode.&quot;  Although this does not fundamentally change the game, you can now compare your results to the other OOTP18 players out there.  Challenge mode restricts a couple things in the game (e.g. player editor, long-term simulation), but does enable your score to be recorded against other players.  These two changes were worth getting OOTP18.    For those that are unfamiliar with the series, OOTP18 is a baseball game for all of the armchair GMs and Managers that are out there.  This is the third iteration that I have played (OOTP16 and OOTP10) and the game continues to evolve very well.  As with the pervious couple of versions, OOTP has the MLB and Player's Association license.  As a sports fan, you always wonder about how you would remake your favorite team into a dynasty and now is your chance.  You start with the ability to manage a MLB team today or any year from 1871.  You may also choose one of several International Leagues that are available.  From day one, you can delegate authority to the AI or control everything.  From the GM perspective, this includes player and staff contracts, free agent signings, major/minor league roster moves, drafts, trades, and organizational budget allocations.  From the manager perspective, you set your pitching rotations and lineups.  At that point, you can dive into playing each baseball game or sim through the days.  All the statistics from MLB history is available and its fun starting from scratch in 1871 to learn about the early pioneers in baseball.  The other great thing about the OOTP series is the ability to create your own fictional leagues, uniforms, and designs with the large user-mod community.  The bottom line is that this game is a must have for people who love baseball. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/208400/,1, This is a game for those who want to experience the nostalgic turn-base RPG.  For those familiar with Ultima IV (1985 release), Avernum will bring back those fond memories.  In Escape from the Pit, you control up to four party members who have been banished from the Empire.  From that seed, the storyline will grow.  Since this is a relaunch of the Avernum series, the graphics are kept simple, but effective and plays efficiently on much older systems.  Combat is turn-base with turns accomplished sequentially by intitiative and party order.  The story is interesting with plenty of side quests and dungeons/caves to crawl around and explore.  There is plenty of content since as of this review, I'm over 12 hours in and have covered around 1/3 of the map.  Bottom line is that this is a fun turn-base RPG.  It's a must for the fans of Ultima IV. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/259060/,1, My impressions of Dominions 4 (~15 hours) is that Illwinter has come up with another winner.  Be warned though, this is a game for folks who really enjoy turn-based strategy games (TBS), especially multi-player TBS (Disclaimer:  I have not tried Dominions 4 MP yet, but Dominions 3 MP was tremendous).  But if you are looking for high-end graphics, a gentle learning curve, hand-holding tutorials or a casual strategy gaming experience, you may want to look elsewhere.   However, if you are a fan of TBS games, Dominions 4 has tremendous depth, content and attention to detail.  From the ability to customize your god to each race with unique abilities, there are many variables to make each game unique.  Gameplay can be a bit daunting initially, but rewards players who carefully plan and execute those strategies.  My only negative at this time regarding Dominions 4 is it appears to be a bit too similar to Dominions 3 which I played heavily in the pre-Steam days.  I¡¯ll update this review after additional playtime with other factions and MP to highlight some of the changes from Dominions 3.  
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/214340/,1, If you enjoy classic point and click adventure games, this is a must.  The art style is great with quirky/odd music and  well done.  Both fit the game world well. The story line is humorous with a strange &quot;love story&quot; with a couple of twists thrown in.  Puzzles and mini-games were east to moderate difficulty, although some combinations were a bit on the strange side.   Completing the game for experienced adventurers would be around 10-12 hours for the first run through.  For achievement seekers, the last one needs to be done with the sound turned off or you will go insane!  The last achievement is a bit of a challenge if you try it, but easier if you just finished the game and have a good memory.  Bottom line is that this was a fun, short adventure that I am looking forward to playing the sequels. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/265890/,1, This is a nice little puzzle game.  It will remind you a bit of the classic minesweeper game on Windows with some additional ways to calculate moves.  Overall, it was a short, fun diversion that you can complete within a few hours. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/289070/,1, It's always interesting to observe the changes in the Sid Meier's Civilization series and Civ VI is no exception. I've always enjoyed the empire building throughout the eras and this version continues my enjoyment of this series.  This review includes updates through the Rise and Fall DLC.  As with the more recent entries, the DLC makes a significant impact on the game and I expect future DLC will continue to strengthen the gameplay.   For newcomer to the series, Civ is a turn-based strategy game.  In the beginning, you must start building your empire from scratch, gathering resources to build, expand, and protect your empire.  As you explore the world, you'll find new resources while your technology improves to allow new structures and new military units and even great wonders of the world.  You will meet other cultures and leaders.  The question is whether you can build a civilization that the stand the test of time.  For veterans of the series, Civ VI biggest change from previous versions was how the cities are built.  In Civ VI, each new building, zone or improvement has to go on a specific tile. This changes some of the city building stratgy that leads to a more focused build for the cities which even impacts the type of Wonders you may want at a particular location. This sort of decision making is what makes Civ VI amazing.  But as with new changes, it has caused a bit of a drawback.  At this point, the AI doesn't do well with this added dimension.  Even at the Deity leve (most difficult), the AI is still overmatched. However, the patches and DLCs continue to improve the game and the AI and I believe by the end, Civ VI will be even greater than the final version of Civ V. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/8930/,1, As an experienced Civ series player, Civ V had a rough start initially and was inferior to the expanded version of Civ IV.  However, just as Civ IV progressed, so did Civ V through the years.  This review reflects Civ V with the 2 expansions (Gods and Kings and Brave New World).  Once again, we face the &quot;Just one more turn&quot; syndrome that this game has always provided.  This 4x turn-based strategy game continues to evolve by enhancing the multiple victory conditions for the game.  Many scenarios are available and the Steam Workshop for Civ now creates easily assessible mods for the game to increase replayability.  The AI still makes strategic mistakes, but evens out a bit at the higher difficulty levels due to AI bonuses/player penalties,  The end-game has greatly improved over previous iterations of the series due to the enhancements to diplomatic and cultural victory conditions.  The replayability and replayability of Civ V is so good, that I will nitpick on a couple of areas for improvement (and mods are out that resovle this too).  Those improvement areas are to make the different cultures even more unique (more unique looks between the cultures) and speeding up the preformance on huge maps.  Otherwise, this Civ V with the DLCs is an excellent game that will take up just one more turn. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/333820/,1, OOTP16 is the baseball game for all of the armchair GMs/Managers out there.  There have been quite a few improvements to OOTP since my last purchase (OOTP10) and the obvious change is the MLB license.  For those unfamiliar with the series, this is a TEXT based game with visuals to generally represent the action.  Once you are hired by your team, you control almost everything (after your budget allocation from the owner).  As the GM, you can directly control (or delegate to the AI) player and staff contracts, FA signing, roster promotions/demotions, trades and even ticket prices.   Then as the manager, you set your pitching rotation and lineups and play ball.  From there, it¡¯s up to you if you want to play the game days or simulate through them and just be the GM.  Finally, there is a ton of flexibility with historical years and statistics of the entire MLB history from 1871.  Pick a season to start and alter history.  Or you can create a completely fictional league to play.  A large user community already exists with entire fictional leagues, uniforms and players that are ready to download and import if you are interested.  Who would like this game: Folks who want to be the GM of their favorite team and enjoy baseball¡¯s rich statistics.    Who would NOT like this game: Folks who want high end graphics and real-time in-game action (stick to the very good console baseball games).

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/25800/,1, You'll understand the grandness of this EU3 when you start out by being able to choose 1 of 250 historical nations between 1453-1789.  From that point, you can lead that country through various historical moments over 3 centuries.  Can you take the role of the Aztecs and dominate Central America and fend off the European invaders?  Or perhaps go to Japan and become Shogun.  Or unite Africa.  Or take a European nation and rule Western Europe.  All those options and more.  The tutorial will give you the basics of the interface, but depending on your country, there are so many more things to learn.   If you decide to try another country in your campagin, you can even save the game and choose a different country.  This is a massive grand strategy game for all war game fans. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/238930/,1, This is a game for those who enjoy complex board games.  In 7 Grand Steps, you lead your family name through multiple generations and ages of history.  You can discover new inventions or try to climb the social ladder.  The dynamics seem simple, but decisions you make affect not only your current situation, but could impact you for multiple generations.  The game will give you the Civilization &quot;one more turn&quot; feel until you realize that the day has slipped away. 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/236850/,1, EU4 continues the greatness of the EU series, this time with the updated engine seen in CK2.  If you own both games and have the CK2-EU4 converter, you can now lead your empire for almost a millennium!  Back in EU4, you can once again choose from hundreds of historical nations around the world.  From the start, you will work to lead your country through history.  You can begin in the New World and try to fight off the European invaders, try to unite Japan or keep the Ottoman empire from falling apart.  This grand strategy game is a must if you enjoy trying to change the course of history.  
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/221640/,1, If you like a challenge, this &quot;simple&quot; game is quite addicting and FAST.  Beware, the levels are hard, harder and hardest before you unlock more levels (which I haven't gotten to yet).    The music is perfect for this game, but soon the voices will keep repeating in your head that say, &quot;BEGIN.  GAME OVER.  BEGIN.  GAME OVER.  BEGIN.  GAME OVER.  BEGIN.  GAME OVER.  BEGIN.  GAME OVER.  BEGIN.  GAME OVER.  BEGIN.  GAME OVER.  BEGIN.  GAME OVER.  BEGIN.  GAME OVER.  BEGIN.  GAME OVER.  BEGIN.  GAME OVER.  BEGIN.  GAME OVER.  BEGIN.  GAME OVER.  BEGIN.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007833990/recommended/72200/,1, This is a nice simulator that gives you the chance to put the universe in your own little sandbox where you have control over every aspect of your creation.  You can examine what happens to our solar system as mass is added to the sun or watch the Death Star orbiting Endor.  If you want to start from scratch, the tools are there to customize whatever system you would like to design.  Bottom line is this is a great game for those who enjoy simulations.
