1,1,postal was a cult and controversial game released in the 90ies . the controversy spins around the fact that in the game you play the role of a mad man
-1,-1,do not buy this {?} it 's not even a true game . the dev just want to make money with trading cards
1,1,simply a masterpiece : the art
1,-1,boring . repetative gameplay . paper thin storyline . awkward controls . i tried hard to like this game .
1,1,a lot better tahn the 2k games in a lot of ways ....
1,1,welcome to the great blue ocean
1,1,very enjoyable vr game . only issue i would say that i had with the game was that you were unable to save progress (in coop not sure if same solo )
1,1,bittersweet . epic tactical level space combat
1,1,1
1,1,this is a fun puzzle game . i found the description confusing but tried it anyway
1,1,awesome retro game !!!
1,1,the devs are amazing
1,1,already shows incredible promise and great potential to be one of the few absolute standout success in the quickly overcrowding genre of survival games . great structure in place for progression
1,1,with sitting back and waiting for stuff to happen ; its actually fun . with the thought of not knowing whats going to happen next !
1,1,it 's great .
1,-1,you know the drill . farm cards
1,-1,hot garbage . this game 's clunky
1,1,issa gud game but it still needs work .

1,1,i like it
1,1,including saints row 3 in my review
1,1,this game is amazing i reccomend it to anyone who loves fast action games
1,1,hell
1,1,i 'm playing this little gem i discovered some years ago and it looks like as incredible as i played long ago . i discovered an indie studio
1,1,great addicting game
1,1,i understand why people could find this game frustrating
1,1,10/10 would cry again
1,1,damnnnn ! i had actualy no idea that chuck norris is an alien !
1,1,so much more than just a terraria clone with multiple planets
1,1,rise of the tomb raider offers more action than the first game this time we have a more prepared lara but still has a lot to learn . +graphics +gameplay +the atmosphere and the new location +action +lara croft 8/10 it is a good game that deserves to be played
1,-1,all these indie games make no sense . can 't you give at least a little more information toward understanding your story at all {?} all this game feels like it is patronizing the player . " oh ! you didn 't see that branch there ? trip and die !" " oh ? you didn 't notice i took away the railing ? splat !" " oh ! you didn 't notice there 's a door to close ? get wrecked
1,1,i am honestly surprised that there are people that still don 't own this . the game is out
1,1,great game dudes . the graphics are pretty good for this type of game and the fps fits just right . its runs smoothly and i very rarely have problems . the only problem i seem to face is that there isnt that many people playing online . other than that
1,1,took me a little bit to get used to it but i enjoyed it a lot
1,1,tremendo juego ! buenos graficos exelente trama es simplemente genial me encato ...
1,1,un clasico :)

1,1,this is the game i 've been waiting for my entire life . it 's fine out of the box
1,-1,joined my second match . started driving to objective . some team member flipped my tank . i had to suicide . couldn 't play until 8 minute timer was completed . uninstalled . 10/10 would uninstall again .
1,1,left 4 dead 2 is a good co-op multiplayer game
1,1,is cool dis game !
1,1,i probably spent 4 hours learning and tweaking this game . if you are not interested in installing mods and changing settings in root folders then i 'd look elsewhere at the moment . if you don 't mind then this game is absolutley incredible . i was scared to get into it when i started because i could sense how deep this game was . i have experience with fallout and fallout 2 but none of the 1st person fallouts . i 'm 18 hours into it and my least favorite part of the game has become my favorite . i was not keen to the idea of colony building when i started but now i 'm building a cha colony fiend and i love it . i have played through one whole controller charge and then some more today . i 'm stopping due to exhaustion . yes it 's not perfect
1,1,i highly recommend this game to anyone who likes playing quick
1,1,this was my first visual novel ever
1,1,tac reloa- tac rel- tac reload !
1,1,i only played 1 game so far
1,1,a pretty short game that you can 100% it in probably 2-3 hours (it took longer waiting for all the trading cards to drop ) but i had a fair bit of fun considering that i 'm not usually into shoot them up games . the positive reviews as well as the affordable price on sale ($0.70 for me ) plus the very achievable achievements (though some i wasn 't sure what was required so i googled ) drew me in . i also appreciate that the developers are on the ball and they get back pretty quickly to queries on the forums as well as working on bugs . it seems that over time they 've added more achievements and levels (for free
1,1,nominated this for " just 5 more minutes " award . i shouldn 't be playing a game with no plot this much and even though most of the game is played " idling " (you can let it run in the background )
1,1,this is the new black
1,1,a very diverse 2d sandbox game full of building
1,1,papa bless !! {?}
1,-1,don 't buy this game . it 's long been abandoned by the developer . it was fun initially and held great promise
1,1,great one !!!
1,1,imagine a neon-colored

1,1,brothers is a game where you play 2 brothers who have set out on a journey to find a magical tree to cure their father who has become ill . brothers has a very unique control scheme where you use a gamepad controller 's 2 analog sticks to control each brother indivdually and each the 2 triggers for them to interact
1,-1,i could never get into it
1,1,not bad for a simple game
1,1,the cave has hilarious narration and is all around a fun game to sit down and play for a few hours . my only issues are that i would recommend using a controller

1,1,i think the game at this point is alright ... but i think it needs to add something to spice up the hit effects
1,-1,tell me lies
1,1,a very interesting little story game freaky but interesting i liked the ending was surprising for me
1,1,have you ever tried to put together a jigsaw puzzle
1,1,incredible game that has a vast selection of steam workshop mods that really add depth and hours of enjoyment . highly recommend this game !
1,1,the puzzles and atmosphere are amazing . it 's a philosophy game
1,1,great game with a great unlock system that encourages players to replay the game in order to unlock new items
1,1,marcus is scrooge and it is absolutely priceless .
1,-1,do i recommend this dlc ? hell no this is the most tedious piece of dlc in existance
1,1,this is a really fun game
1,-1,hard to tell what is happening
1,1,this is definitely a good game but it 's also definitely unfinished . if you like building and space then this is a game for you . if you are looking for some more adventuring and exploration elements
1,1,played btd for almost half my life
1,-1,i like the puzzles but the inner voice actor is annoying and the horror as well as gameplay is utterly boring ....
1,1,a high quality rpg maker game . there are plenty of dull ones out there
1,1,this game is f +ck/ n awesome ! just buy it ! no regrets =)
1,-1,sweatshop is probably one of the worst clicker games i 've ever played ! the game is crashing so often and if you are unlucky you will lose game progress through this . achievements are not unlocking at the right time in the game
1,1,fap simulator 2018
1,-1,me and my room-mate bought it as it gave a good idea of extremly fun multiplayer

1,1,<3
1,1,after playing the game since june 2017
1,1,{?}
1,1,this is an incredible sweet and wonderful adventure game . it 's fairly easy but the game is not without it 's problems . in some aspects it 's similar to kirby . it has a lovely atmosphere with great music . the artstyle and animation is simple and adorable . the story is straight forward and easy to follow . gameplay is a mixture of platforming
1,1,grand theft loading screen simulator v
1,1,a neat 1-2 hour cyberpunk-ish exploration game . there are no enemies and no combat
1,1,mister torgue needs to cameo more often in future games
1,1,form was a blast . although it 's really short
1,1,you know the expansion pass is worth it 's value when it just makes the last years great rpgs cry in the corner in shame .
1,1,its ok
1,1,insurgency is one of the best army themed team shooters you can pick up . it combines some of the best modes seen in battlefield
1,1,i cannot stop playing . simple concept
1,1,the best game ever !!
1,1,yeah ...
1,-1,they make a " free weekend " event to try out the game
1,1,its a good game keeps you busy and all around going for hours upon end
1,1,best game lel
1,1,amazing point-and-click adventure game presented from an overhead
1,1,a great game . the only downside it the tediousness of it . great charecters
1,-1,by the numbers rts game . not impressed .
1,1,an awesome
1,-1,it 's like dynasty warriors except the combat is really clunky . the game gets really stale after the first 2 hours honestly .
1,-1,i can 't recommend this game . reasons : 1. the waiting time vs playing time is like 50% . in other words
1,1,this is a lot like saki : achiga-hen ... ...lots of complicated scoring

1,-1,what the
1,1,this is a fun multiplayer game of the brawler variety . throwing bricks at one another and stealing each others children are the order of the delay . best played with a group of friends with incredibly dark humour as kidnapping jokes are shared amongst the odd brick to the face
1,-1,what happens now ? funding after $2.5m will go into polishing the features and content we 've already committed to . after that
1,1,very easy to mod and fun to play online with friends
1,1,this has poise .
1,1,never played a visual novel until this game and when i played it ... boy
1,1,good
1,1,this is another great game from artifex mundi playing this game make my brain work harder think and think
1,1,this game is very very fun but underrated would love to see it with more people its also very nice to play it with friends 10/10
1,-1,can 't launch the game since the dlc is released :/ (ctd after loading )
1,1,when i first saw this game it reminded me of " turrican " from back in the snes days . this game is a bit different but still has some good visuals

1,1,fantastic + beautiful graphics + fun gameplay + challenging
1,1,a real banger 2d hotline miami-esqe game with a cool theme and one of the best game soundtracks ive ever heard
1,1,distraint has a great story and atmosphere
1,1,play this game with headphones ! {?} {?} {?} {?} {?} {?} {?} s ? s {?} " hearing " has a simple premise to it
1,1,for the 15 $ they 're offering since downfall
1,1,one of the best fast action fps on the market
1,-1,level design is somewhere between bad and plain {?} -ish
1,-1,swim around in what looks like layers of contaminated poo and search for small balls that you will never ever find because there is no radar or clue on where to go . all this while listening to some monotone bass string instrument that plays the same tone over and over until it feels like it 's burned into your head forever . this game is a frustrating piece of {?} total opposite of a zen game
1,1,this is my only true experience of an addictive game . it is very cleverly designed so that you just have to keep playing . can 't want for the third one to come out in a few weeks . 10/10. the game does not spoon feed you
1,1,a game very similar to farcry 3 (without uplay of course c : ) and red faction : guerilla
1,1,after playing newer titles from telltale this doesn 't look as good as other but it 's still ok and playable :)
1,-1,this game is not worth it . i received it because i already owned the original along with the dlc which i 've played two times to completion for all the achievements . don 't get me wrong
1,1,hey ! what are you doing here ?! reading reviews ?! disregard all reviews ! this is half-life ! this is the reason that steam exists in the first place !
1,1,ermagerd ! had no idea being a goat involves so much rampage . highly recommended to take part in the hidden world of goats !
1,1,very good game love it :d
1,1,love it . one of the best whodunnit vn and one of the best danganronpa games .
1,1,the game has changed so much since the founder edition launched . but with each beta release it got better and better . if you love space 4x games you won 't be disappointed .
1,1,lie down ... try not to cry ... cry a lot .... what a wonderful game . great story
1,1,i don 't know exactly why
1,1,a fun shooting game with a cast of memorable characters (with japanese voice-acting ) and a reasonable amount of challenge . gameplay uses a shields-mechanic rather than a single-hit to kill you . it 's fairly long for a shooting game with 12 stages . story is pretty long and incomprehensible unless you stop to read the long exposition .
1,1,this feels like work . why can 't i stop playing ?
1,1,preety cool
1,1,best game evar ! :3
1,1,it 's big tahm !! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! !!

1,1,blackwell epiphany concludes one of the best point and click adventure series in years . it 's amazing how the series developed for all this time . each game in the series kept getting better and better . and this applies to every aspect of the games - the puzzles
1,1,i don 't think i 've ever experienced a game quite like heart &slash. a fusion of devil may cry-esque 3d action brawling and binding of isaac-style random generation
1,1,tekken more like sexxen
1,1,afrika is the main scenario on this war . good game to take a co-op walkthrough with a friend and play a stealth and infiltration style !! sniper elite iii is set around three years prior to the events of v2
1,1,gameplay feels clunky
1,1,ooh boy
1,1,if you like 80 's cheesy action
1,1,this game is fun with vr and friends
1,1,i have played it in coop mod only with my friend and it was really good :d
1,1,it 's alright
1,1,a classic platformer . no need to explain why .
1,1,easy fun game relaxing mobile game that is child freindly . i my self used it as an introduction to teach greek history and mythology to my young children . would recccomend as a pick up for cheap child freindly game .

1,1,the first time i played the game
1,1,10/10
1,1,2
1,1,it 's a bare bones game where the main hook is 80s midi music and you drive for as long as possible . the soundtrack is amazing . i learned about artists that i didn 't knew existed before this game . however
1,-1,lags my pc with (16 gb ) of ram for some reason its not working for me . tried different settings and wallpapers still choppy .

1,-1,it 's a fun concept with some fun design
1,1,brilliant fun .
1,1,bought game played with 2 friends hated it refunded 274 monthes later ... mmmmm delicious birthday money bought game again to give another try found steel shovel murdered all survived horde night with only a shovel died by crawler cried 11/7 would cry again
1,1,i was intimidated upon hearing about the premise of this game ... it sounds like one of those games that are only fun to people with very specialized knowledge and tastes . but actually the developers have succeeded in making a very approachable and fast game about economy
1,1,absolutely spiffing .
1,-1,i 'm not too proud to give credit to a developer when it 's due
1,-1,does it make for a good mental debate ? well yeah i 'd say it does . is it objectively fun to play ? no
1,1,nice simple physics based time waster - its just balancing bars what more can you say
1,1,it 's neat and cool but we need ng +++
1,1,this game was a suprise for me . i did not now about shadowrun universe before
1,1,kind of like csgo (just a bit ) with quite alot of fun elements . i recommend this game if you 're to poor for csgo .
1,1,step 1 : find a tank step 2 : get to the tank step 3 : find a german step 4 : drive over the german 9/11 would play again
1,1,the dark souls of casual relaxing games .
1,1,it is all the reviews says
1,1,all four of the games in this collection are great fun . if you like megaman
1,1,i can say that a gem is lying there . go and grab it . the twists of the story will break your heart . between orders and being human you will lose one part of your soul . unless you lose it totally at the end
1,1,a quality pc port of (what is quite possibly ) my favorite game of all time . no other game in the series has quite managed to capture the same magic that the original has . if you can stomach the first few hours that is infamously unforgiving for new players

1,1,awesome ! ive spent over 10 hours on this game !
1,1,when i was young i played a game called ecco the dolphin on sega megadrive / genesis . it scared the hell out of me because it was pretty intense trying to survive against the great white sharks and angry crabs which inhabited the ocean . ever since those days i 've been unsettled by underwater gameplay . i find it difficult to play any kind of shark infested water scenario and usually end up asking whoever i 'm with to take over . i had the bright idea of picking this game up because i like base building and survival
1,-1,decent game
1,-1,i would love to love this game
1,-1,this game started out as a good roguelike should : many types of weapons
1,1,this game is neat and cool
1,1,revolver is a nice addition to a great game .
1,1,it 's hard to find a game that scratches the same itch that final fantasy tactics gave me so long ago

1,1,introduction : tom clancy 's the division is an third person open world action adventure mmo set in manhattan in the year 2030 after a deadly virus burned through the state of new york . the president issued directive 51 and put the state into martial law . you are an agent of the jtf and the division fighting the result of the virus - deadly gangs
1,1,the best part of this game is the 1 v 1 mode so you wouldn 't need to strugle with an ultra autist in your team .
1,1,do you like the {?} ing nerd do you like mega man or castlevania then this is the game for you it mixes the action of mega man and the difficultly of castlevania but it also has the nerd and everyone else you see in his videos and if you ask me to sum this up in one word awsome (also this game is very hard so if you want to through your controller into the screen you are not the only one )
1,1,the single player game features historical play around the mediterranean or randomly generated maps with good customization options but potentially unbalanced starting positions . a scenario editor and mod support are also available . the interface could be improved ; specifically
-1,1,i really enjoy the story to the point i didn 't want to take screen shots of the last cgs to ruin it for other people (even with spoiler tag ). do feel for 13 $ it is a bit on the short side of a story no real character development . for a vn if your looking for choices there is none it 's a linear story but at the end i had mix feelings . it 's a type of title would want to give a in between . i enjoy the music and writing i just don 't feel there was enough of it . would reccomend it to anyone if on a sale . since i wrote this review they did change the price of the game to $8.99 so would definatly reccomend to anyone who likes vn
1,1,they released it ? dejm son played it 1 - 2 years back when servers were full for a whole week but now ? you can play on server 2 - 3 days and its empty . game is good they 're updating it every week . and the price after the release ? awful
1,1,if yoo love to rage at hackers
1,1,scared me a year ago
1,1,good game
1,1,hexcells infinite *this review will not cover everything stated in my previous reviews about how it works etc . the focus will be on changes to the series and what has stayed the same . for basic information about the game check my first " hexcells " review or the videos and pictures to get the idea . learning from the 2 previous installments of the series " hexcells infinite " brings the probably popular request of a puzzle generator giving a " near " infinite amount of randomly generated puzzles that can be played . i will still say though that the quality of these levels feel a lot lower than the standard levels . as its most recent predecessor " hexcells plus " the game features 36 standard levels which increase in difficulty the further you go as more concepts are added and the complexity increases . you can not play the levels any order you like as you have to complete levels to unlock more . the system works by dividing the 36 levels into 6 worlds and awarding you a certain amount of " tiles " depending on level and how many mistakes you do . once a world is unlocked you can play any of the six levels of that world in any order you like . the game has 7 achievements 5 for unlocking worlds 2-6 and the sixth for completing every level without mistakes (not in a row )
1,1,this game made me so nostalgic about that good old games like vietcong 1 and vietcong 2 from illusion softworks and i feel its like vietcong 3. mah dream came true . thanks .
1,1,the legend of heroes isn 't action packed
1,-1,this is a great game
1,1,great use of minimal yet versitile controls

1,1,you 'll understand the grandness of this eu3 when you start out by being able to choose 1 of 250 historical nations between 1453-1789. from that point
1,-1,very pretty and atmospheric
-1,-1,due to what the devs plan on doing and have done . i can not recommend this despite being a huge fan of nightmare on elm street . i am also tempted to leave a bad review for the game itself due to what they are doing with the game . the devs seem dead set on destroying what they have created and doing so bit by bit . they plan on nerfing freddy based on numbers they know are skewed since he just came out . ( and everyone is going to play him ) as well as the lowest level of players . ( rank20 ) you do not balance a game just off of the weakest players unless you want to kill off your game quickly . they just admitted to be doing so in the latest stream as of this review . ( among other issues ) the funny thing is based on their own stats and how they talk they should be massively buffing one of the best killers in the game . ( the nurse
1,1,it 's basically a more polished version of mega cities from ios / android . not a bad thing though . good city-building card-based puzzler . fun for all . worth the money .
1,1,i played this years ago anyways was this supposed to be a horror game or a reminder i won 't get a life
1,1,it 's technically a harder version of sudoku . i think that the overall experience is gud . the controls could be improved though . otherwise
1,1,you 'll never be so frustrated keeping someone alive in your alive . really well put together little game- a few of the achivements are head scratchingly annoying as you attempt to balance moods
1,1,a really good survival game . the feeling over taking control of the environment is extremely rewarding . although the host sequence freaked me out . highly recommended .
1,1,there is no reason to read reviews for this game . sure
1,1,great free game
1,1,very nice game . when i saw the price i thought that there wouldnt be much to offer
1,1,this game is very nice if you liked the old 'rock n ' roll racing ' if you have a vr
1,-1,no
1,1,? a first look at - planetbase - video ? positives : i like the graphics and the feel to the game . animations and sound works for me . i 'm looking forward to actually learn the game . negatives : i experience the camera to be a bit stiff and limited . the built in tutorial left me with the feeling i got so much more to learn to actually be able to succeed . the speed phase of the tutorial is also very slow . it could be a lot faster . i also appreciate some good music to the games . the music here was very soft and relaxing . sometimes there was no music at all . so
1,1,masterpiece .
1,1,great game for a true fps lover ! pros : -great class system with custom skills -unique and spot on graphics -combat arms players will feel at home -easy to learn controls and navagateable ui -will have you coming back for more -fans of the show and movies will appreciate -guns are very customizable cons : -only 4 levels at the moment -occasional lag spikes and disconection -aiming system is hard to get use to (at least for me ) -still in early access / not many lobbies -limited customization (as of now we will see what the future holds ) verdict : -8.5- an all around
1,-1,has a major bug where your battery doesn 't recharge properly if you select traditional augs and then change prison jumpsuits .
1,1,xaxaxa
1,-1,this game is honestly not ready for primetime . i wanted to like it : a classic platformer built around picking up and throwing objects (like super mario bros 2 !)
1,1,it 's been two years of non-stop football action in the only ever football game that feels even remotely like playing football in real life . the physics aspect of it gives it a much stronger 'feel' of football than any of the more 'realistic' rivals .
1,1,to all of the people who say this game can get too boring too fast : from the beginning of the game
1,1,fun sidescrolling shooter . you need to think about a level before you can complete it because you only have a limited amount of resources .
1,1,fabulous engineering and automation posibilities with the limit of your production and your imagination . whether your goal is to build a nuclear bomb or launch yourself into space
1,1,pretty awesome short movies .people who are making these
1,-1,123123123
1,1,back to the 90 's! had a great time with that game . stunning soundtrack and always up for surprises . more please !
1,1,a chill
1,-1,video review - <url> building your indie game around an online experience with a high initial price is more often than not suicide . this game suffers the same fatal problem many other online based indie games face - a dead playerbase
1,1,deus vult
1,1,adorable living bullets .
1,-1,one step above a mobile game . if you get it for free or a buck it is worth playing . otherwise just pass .
1,1,this game is really good . i 've never been into shmups but i keep coming backto steredenn trying to get those last achievements . every playthrough is a bit different with randomized enemies and upgrades and environmental hazards . local co-op is a good addition but the shared health bar prevents me from getting very far with anybody i know .
1,1,a fantastic game from squire enix & dontnod !! 1.graphics is just awesome .color combination used here is just perfect and capture the true american theme ...what is more
1,-1,this game doesn 't really explain well what it 's expecting from the player . might be because of early access .
1,1,this game is amazing . the characters are everything you 'd imagine a real gangster / mobster would be . the main characters
1,-1,a fun little game to play with friends . the crashing gets so bad you cant even start the game
1,-1,poorly designed
1,1,one of my favourite adaptations of the cult-classic : " the four horsemen of the apocalypse "
1,1,this game has 100 + hours of entertainment easily . has that binding of isaac / spelunky replaybility . the combat is fun and when i die
1,1,solid game !!:) better than ice cream
1,1,much recommend
1,1,it 's in space . it 's a rouge-like . you can target enemy subsystems and send boarding parties . it 's in pause-time . there 's a race of telepathic space slugs . it 's almost frustratingly hard . why haven 't you bought this game yet ?
1,1,it 's {?} ing awesome !!!! {?} me right at the {?} !!!!!
1,1,nice and short casual " click to upgrade " game
1,1,just 5 more minutes . labor of love .
1,1,mom get out of my room
1,1,i like the sexy calculator
1,1,much better than i expected
1,1,the best game magazine in the world and now on steam ! stunning new format that fully turn over your notion about magazines and also stunning hat in tf2 that you get after buying episode # 1. welcome ! glad to meet you ! web site : <url> group : <url> <url>
1,1,legalzinho
1,1,this game is not a bad game
1,1,there are basically two things you should know about this game : first
1,-1,....
1,1,great game to play
1,1,is fun
1,1,caillou has truly ascended
1,1,the shades
1,1,contract with the devil is a low-priced hidden object game from a ukrainian developer with well animated visuals and interesting puzzles offering a promising storyline . unfortunately the game doesn 't know whether it should concentrate on the horror or the cuteness factor (the 2 are kind of mutually exclusive ) and there are some bugs present . the game is still good
1,1,absolutely amazing software
1,1," how to survive " can be a pretty intense game on the harder difficulties
1,1,very nice sequel and for the most part on par with the previous game . the gameplay is defenitely more challenging than the first game due to level design
1,1,great game
1,1,so
1,-1,always the same facebook games . you start playing a tutorial with the same story (your base is under attack or you found a enemy base and need to recover it )
1,-1,wish i had read the first reviews 8 neg 9/15
1,1,one simply does not get this for the fact it 's a revamp with tails being unlockable . one would get this because the game is considered a legend of the early 90s
1,1,calling all lvl up junkies this is where its at .
1,1,the best
1,1,omg wtf bruce wayne is batman {?}
1,1,i wish i could rewind time aswell
1,1,low budget-oblivion but it satisfies mostly . my only pet peeve is maybe the late game which is kinda lacking in story
1,1,imagine an fps like doom
1,1,es realista
1,1,great controls
1,-1,note : the multiplayer is broken as of this review . it was tough to decide whether to recommend this version of mortal kombat x
1,-1,should have stayed on ios . too basic for pc . every level can be played the same . endless just too easy .
1,1,ok this game is awesome and extremely addictive
1,1,gorgeous art
1,1,a pretty good
1,1,2/3 of the game is {?} but hey
1,1,it 's a mixture between a game and a tv show . excellent story and characters . great graphics and effects . extremely high production quality .
1,1,calming and beautiful scenes and environments with best soundtrack to give you all the feels .
1,1," don 't stop me now " " <url> tonight i 'm gonna have myself a real good time i feel alive and the world it 's turning inside out yeah ! i 'm floating around in ecstasy so don 't stop me now don 't stop me 'cause i 'm having a good time having a good time i 'm a shooting star leaping through the skies like a tiger defying the laws of gravity i 'm a racing car passing by like lady godiva i 'm gonna go go go there 's no stopping me i 'm burning through the sky yeah ! two hundred degrees that 's why they call me mister fahrenheit i 'm trav 'ling at the speed of light i wanna make a supersonic man out of you don 't stop me now i 'm having such a good time i 'm having a ball don 't stop me now if you wanna have a good time just give me a call don 't stop me now ('cause i 'm having a good time ) don 't stop me now (yes i 'm having a good time ) i don 't want to stop at all ... yeah ! i 'm a rocket ship on my way to mars on a collision course i am a satellite i 'm out of control i am a sex machine ready to reload like an atom bomb about to oh oh oh oh oh explode i 'm burning through the sky yeah ! two hundred degrees that 's why they call me mister fahrenheit i 'm trav 'ling at the speed of light i wanna make a supersonic woman of you don 't stop me don 't stop me don 't stop me hey hey hey ! don 't stop me don 't stop me ooh ooh ooh (i like it ) don 't stop me don 't stop me have a good time
1,-1,not what i was expecting
1,1,one of the best fps 's i 've ever played
1,1,you remember the train mission in gta san andreas ? yeah
1,1,very easy but fun . worth the money . don 't use cheat engine for money . you don 't need . it . ruins the experience . skip easy and just do normal during first play . worth it .
1,1,i love this game so much
1,1,i cite this as my favourite game . look at my library . 470 something games . this is the best .
1,1,i rarely say this but . my money was well spent . and i really meen that . so lets break it down real simply
1,-1,the megaman series require the controls to feel absolutely on point . they are often unforgiving
1,1,great game !
1,-1,garbage this remastered version doesnt work on modern pc there is no support for new graphics card do you get it ? remastered version doesnt support modern pc !!! " remastered " while old version works fine this is how you dont remaster game
1,1,wonderful art and music for this short story about a priest and his dog that are looking for his daughter kidnapped by pinestripe
1,1,hideously addictive
1,1,<url> the fragility of the units in the early game can ruin runs and drive away players before they can be hooked by the variety this game has to offer .
1,1,bring together the sounds and make your way with your own music . wonderful imagination and creatie universe . this game is a great piece of art . you 'll both enjoy and amaze the atmosphere .
1,1,this game is insanely good . graphics are top-down minimalistic and don 't distract from gameplay . story is provided through bite-sized nuggets of optional interaction as you progress through the game . it 's difficult but rewarding
1,1,>potato pc >can run insurgency fairly well >figure indie game piece of cake >buy game >download and go to load up >put settings on low >all is good for the most part >first game >send assault squad to charge >gg get f *cked pal activates >game stutters >no big deal pc is potato / used to it >go to use hose >ubroughtthisuponyourself.jpg >computer starts spazzing out >ungodly stuttering noise begins >screen looks like a broken gameboy >stuttering gets worse it sounds like like skrillex meets wall-e fan fict >computer dies >load back up >angrily take it out on npcs >10/10
1,1,5 years old in this game and still counting
1,1,game of the year
1,1,yeah
1,1,good luck getting skilled teammates that can speak english ...
1,1,rain will never be the same for me again .
1,-1,if you like rng
1,1,if perfection were a thing this would be that thing .
1,1,i really like this . lots of fun challenging at times while still having a great story and excellent dialogue .
1,1,it cool
1,1,as someone who beat just cause 1 and 2 i can say that the third installment is the best game of the series so far . not only the controls feel much better
1,1,disappointing start to the series with the first watch dogs
1,1,great game to chill while listening to music .
1,-1,built a shelter
1,-1,a more simple basic version of vegas pro thats decides to change how to work certain ways of editing videos . depending on how long you 've been using vegas pro
1,1,90% modding 10% actual gameplay (wish i was kidding xd lmao )
1,1,really enjoy my time with this game have unlock all the endings but 5. in my opinion is a lot better story then heileen 1 and really don 't have to play 1 unless you want more background on some of the characters . my favorite character has to be black . he 's a cat that accompanies heileen in most of the journey . the endings are mostly good some are extremely close to another but all of them by right feels different . going to try get the rest of the endings still enjoying the story it 's a nice pick up but wouldn 't reccomend the first one unless like i said you want a start but i feel didn 't add really anything to the second part
1,1,great game and its free !
1,1,amazing game !!!
1,1,a great conclusion to a great video game series ! jk
1,1,great upgrade from kf1. however i have some minor complaints ..but as this is early access don 't take this review as a review for the full release . -new clot camera spinning is annoying as hell ...when your focusing on a big zed and all of a sudden the camera turns to a clot grabbing on to you is just bad game design . kf1 had it right where you could still focus on different enemies and not be forced to deal with 1. - don 't use crosshairs for your own sake - some audio issues ..i found when having a large crowd engage you and your team mates the audio would fritz and just sound like a mess . -performance wise
1,1,introduction gaben has finally finished and is about to launch
1,-1,the only thing bad on my pc is my gpu and in ark i get around 40 fps everything low
1,1,this game is relentlessly low-key hilarious . it 's absurd and silly
1,1,i have not played much of it
1,1,love it
1,1,the look of this game makes people think it 's simple or childish
1,1,friggin ' awesome ! better than mario kart !
1,-1,why is this even on steam ?
1,1,excelent experience ! recomend to all ! should use a controller for a better experience ! as for art and music i don 't have to say that only makes the experience of this game
1,1,my simple review is that it runs great on my system
1,1,the total idea is good . but they couldn 't put most of them in reality . the best thing about this game is the story . for 2007 game it was (and also still ) really good and captivating . but for the rest of the mechanics the best thing i 'd say is " mediocre " . 6/10
1,1,when i brought this game i 'm not clear that the game 's audio is not suitable for macos
1,-1,3/10 - meh - me
1,1,retro city rampage ? dx is a very decent example of how nostalgia is done . the game 's plot is nice and clean along with many references which make the game better and better . there are many items and customizations to buy with your in-game money . there are power-ups
1,-1,honestly
1,1,at first i was somewhat excited to hear that sega was going to port one of the best sonic games out there on pc . finally
1,1,i thought it was gonna be a cute little game but it 's the most hardcore {?} ing {?} i 've ever played . only buy this game if you are skilled and are ok with dying a lot
1,1,it 's a fun game
1,1,fun but its hard to play with a keyboard and the ai are wayyy over aggressive
1,-1,i
1,1,yo
1,1,this is a lovely little sequel to a great little free jam game
1,1,short and simple but effective kinetic novel . depressing as hell end .
1,1,can 't get enough of that diddy
1,-1,what 's the point of this dlc ? you can already cheat in the base game by putting in codes
1,-1,i am sorry i kickstarted this .
1,1,great game ! greatly improved after it 's intial release
1,1,short . hand drawn animation style that reminds me of reading rainbow . easy
1,1,casual shmup meets waifu fantasy
1,1,the grimmest of dawns . pretty much titan quest
1,1,you can duel wield shotguns whilst doing a front-flip . it 's fun and replayable . 9/10 (unpopulated multiplayer servers ).
1,1,it 's portal
1,-1,darksiders is a novel idea that has too many glaring bugs and glitches that weigh it down . the " black throne elevator glitch " is a more immediate example that comes to mind in regards to how the game can force you to completely restart due to a glitch the community has known about for years . indeed
1,1,a truly good and fresh fps
1,1,just completed the game and played with sound cancelling head phones the entire way . the most intense
1,1,(often played offline
1,1,the lovechild of sonic the hedgehog and outrun .
1,-1,nah
1,1,a timeless classic with gameplay
1,1,fun game if you play with friends that ain 't going full competitive but still try to win while still having fun otherwise {?} game
1,-1,{?} lol
1,-1,this game is a silly cash grap that do not work that well on pc
1,-1,do not buy until take-two fixes their {?}
1,1,the art and the well-thought-through presentation make the long dark an excellent survival game . the cold
1,1,fast
1,1,great gameee living for ages <3
1,-1,the game graphics is good but you get shot and you die to fast the game crash to much and take for ever load the game and to many fps drop the server suck bad na server never work only eu server work for me and the game only have 2.000 players only all the time the game is like dead for $28 not recommend
1,1,fun puzzle game
1,1,very fun puzzle game with some great concepts . it was a little bit short and could 've done with some harder puzzles . i didn 't come across any glitches in my playthrough like others did so maybe they have fixed some since then . i recommend it on sale for a few dollars if you get bored one day . it could 've been a much better game if some extra time was spent designing the stages .
1,-1,i love puzzle based games and i want to have fun
1,1,shantae : risky 's revenge is a cute
1,1,great stealth game . you can pick the style of play : fast and deadly or silent and undetected or anywhere in between .
1,1,it 's pretty good . gameloading offers a broader look at a wider cross-section of the independent games scene
1,1,skull and bones hype yall
1,-1,one of the most overrated games of all time . this game has some of the most boring level design
1,1,this gayme is duh bast but its super {?} laggy
1,1,the developers of this game are amazing . they 're constantly putting their game at 75% off and keep having the base game for free . pros : you play as clowns amazing developers ( {?} you starbreeze ) a lot of fun content for the game even better w / friends cons : some heists get repetitive after a while friendly bots don 't help overall : this game is {?} ing amazing
1,1,i love the humour
1,1,shovel knight is
1,1,even today oblivion is still great to play
1,1,sanic 4 girlz
1,1,a lot better than the xbox 360 version ...this pc version gives you a lot more control over the battlefield . surprising large file size and cpu requirements . * you have many options to turn that down though * battle system like the old " saga " games ...keep your battle rank low unless you want bosses to one-shot you . if you have the time and space to download this title and enjoy challenging rpg 's...do give this a try !!
1,1,great game however would like to see more building options such as multiple floors and more quick build optoions .
1,1,scary
1,-1,broken achievements . the dev promised at the end of october to fix them within a week . a few days ago he give us an update ... they will not be fixed before spring 2019. don 't start this game if you care about getting 100% .
1,1,best game of the world

1,1,a game that intially challenged me in ways i hadn 't thought possible
1,-1,this game is overprice
1,1,my impressions of dominions 4 (~15 hours ) is that illwinter has come up with another winner . be warned though
1,1,the graphics are a delight to look at ( especially considered the first game was made in 2005 ! )
1,1,kung tangkilikin mo ang automating redstone devices sa minecraft
1,1,gives playing steam games a whole new experience . the unfortunate thing is that it doesn 't go well with some games
1,1,this is a very fun game but in the words of yoda " the pay-to-wins are strong with this one "
1,1,i put a little birdy to spy on them !
1,1,i love this game trust me i have 2
1,-1,after playing for a few months now and nearly 2000 hours
1,1,edit
1,1,nice game
1,1,this is such an epic game thanks to it 's motivated and dedicated developers & community . game has developed even further this summer with asus family partnership and much more stuff like intel i9 cpus- .. what this game does : ? let 's you get familiar with most updated pc parts ? teaches you how to build a pc in real life ? asus rog family is now partnered (they read my e-mails ? ) ? custom water cooling ? and soon new career mode ! i appreciate the active discord group where you can directly report bugs you encounter in- game and even talk about real life stuff
1,1,as far as i can tell
1,-1,the game itself : sorta fun . double-jump is w and up arrow together . hit boxes are unclear and poorly defined . character iceskates before and after movement
1,1,i love this game
1,1,i love hte black and white gameplay . an absolute must have in every collection .
1,1,classic ?
1,1,i remember having this game from a steam reduction earned while crafting a badge
1,1,hell yeah pinball ! if you enjoy playing pinball machines
1,1,its been like five minutes and i need addiction rehab xd
1,1,one of the very few games i go back to play over and over again . it punishes you for being bad and rewards you for taking risks and challenging yourself .
1,1,i laek it lol but seriously th best in the series here
1,1,if you love dlc you will love this game . never ending sale .
1,1,when it works
1,1," send your spy to be your enemy 's king " is best way to win
1,1,one of my best childhood memories was playing this game and then discussing the characters and the plot with my friends during our spare time . so many plot twists to discuss
1,1,if a duck says its good clearly this is a good game .
1,1,a pretty good shmup without going overboard on bullet hell elements . the multiple ships help for adapting to your playstyle for the randomized runs . as with most roguelites you 're bound to have lucky and unlucky runs
1,1,{?} {?} {?} {?} {?} {?} ? {?} {?} {?} {?} {?} {?} {?} {?} .
1,-1,short version : makes you do important choices with consequences based on very little
1,1,for fans of stardew valley this game is an interesting prosition ; similar gameplay but a more directive plot and narrative . the lack of handholding in figuring out how best to manage your resources is one of the joys (or pains ) of the game . this game is certainly a timesink with some frustrating grinding elements but i loved the humour and the various 'quests' i was given by an array of interesting characters . while i loved it i 'd check out other reviews ; i didn 't find any bugs though it has been patched extensively since release and a lot of people were put off by the amount of grinding involved in finishing the game .
1,1,such a classic
1,1,rockman 11 is pretty rock solid
1,1,one of the best roguelikes in my opinion . doesn 't get old like gungeon did to me . fast-paced and skill-based ; luck is less of a factor in success in a given run .
1,1,how to learn russian in 5 minutes
1,1,this game is cool and funny but it need more improvement

1,1,i really don 't know why this game isn 't more known than it actually is . it 's a great roguelite
1,-1,after playing for more than an hour i got frustrated with this game . the controls are extremely primitive and the collision with the spikes just makes you want to smash the keyboard . seems to be rushed by the developer . avoid this game .
1,1,spicy meme gud yeees
1,1,really damn good game
1,1,this game shows promise
1,1,this game is amazing . i absolutely love it . i didn 't care for the first game all that much because it was too slow
1,1,the disciples series is one of the most beautiful underrated franchise in gaming strategy . it is the same genre as the classic heroes of might and magic
1,1,this ... this is a good game . you should buy it and come play with us online . + cute art + excellent music + friendly online community + amusing writing in campaigns + you can accelerate the game speed to match your attention span + it involves deck building

1,1,this here is an underrated gem in the co-op
1,1,verical drop heroes really caught me off guard and exceeded my expectations !!! at first let me share with you the best part of it i personally loved :it's a mix of some of the greatest and most beloved indie games out there !the platform mechanics and gameplay as well as the facial fun expressions are insired by battleblock theater !see for yourself ;) <url> <url> so let us continue and talk about gameplay !so gameplay is really uniqua and actually a lot relaxing !you can even set attack to auto and jumt move throught the map .pretty simple huh ?you also have two special attacks one range based (bow
1,1,fantastic expansion that adds significant depth and replayability . this dlc makes the game feel brand new . the chosen really give you a run for your money and add a unique unexpected challenge to missions that is really refreshing . one of the best dlcs money can buy .
1,1,absolutely amazing !! the detail is superb with new voice acting for npc - additional content ( like - more rooms to explore and side content ). the music is awesome - the perfect gift for half-life lovers .

1,-1,mindcubes is a cheap game made with unity . by cheap i mean not the price only but execution and the way it feels overall . it isn 't the worst game out there
1,1,while terraria does speak for itself
1,1,very good story . great artwork but a bit short . i would have love if the game continued after cinders becomes queen (or anything else ). the game is high quality but the length is too short to justify a 20 $ price tag .
1,1,good game
1,-1,for me bad
1,1,an amazing story driven rpg with over 100 hours of content . also a very well polished game by yours truly cd projekt red . pick it up if you want an amazing game for very little money
1,1,the tightest controls to the most wonderfully frantic combat you ever did play with a delightfully 80 's soundtrack to boot . punch a grenade back at the fool who threw it at you ! throw meat to summon saber-tooth hamsters ! deflect bullets with your head ! die to bullets in your butt .
1,1,why don 't you already own this ?
1,1,just a quick note to say
1,1,are you telling me you don 't own this game ?
1,1,if you 'd like to create an awesome ant farm where the ants have the possiblilty to kill or break out of thier farm this is the game for you . managing prisoners is fun

1,1,a very good suspenseful indie game . pixel art is used very good in the art style of the game and the story is rich and full of content . the soundtrack is also amazing . i just wish there was a season 3

1,1,#beaten (switch) 4 hours - pc 50 hours - switch stuffed with goodness hollow knight is one of the best gated platformers / " metroidvania " games ever made . a game that draws from the formentioned gated platformers and also from other places . dark souls is another one i liken it to in terms of death and experience / money loss and understanding the enemies by trial and error . pros : - wonderful hand drawn art and animation - fantastic world building - great use of npcs to tell story and develop character - tons of optional areas
1,1,think of all the pain you have had from dying in a game . think about all the times bad luck searched you out in order to mess you up . this is the game that glorifies that feeling . you will die
1,1,it 's an amazing game ! first of all
1,1,this is good game
1,1,maybe the best puzzle game on steam .
1,1,one of the few survival open world games that i enjoy . nominated this for " the labor of love " as the game still gets updates .
1,1,yessss !!!!
1,1,this is the best game i have ever played or experienced .
1,1,slain ! is an action
1,1,made airpline simulation game called it 9/11 simulator got great rating best game ever

1,1,great game
1,1,this is the true fps game :d
1,1,probably the hardest one handed game i 'll ever get to play . one of those dimes coming out of nowhere . get it if you 're much into pure challenge .
1,-1,the game has some flaws
1,1,love this game . it actually for me felt like a genuine game that held true to the awesome anime it represents .
1,1,i haven 't played a wwe game since wwe '12. i hated it . but i found this game to be enjoyable . the controls are almost perfect for a wrestling game and it has a good amount of wrestlers
1,1,a fun survival game to play on your own or with friends
1,1,dead cells embraces all tropes of the million rougelites out there and sends it out of the park . combat is intense
1,-1,update : if you want cancer
1,1,i would recommend this game at the very least due to genre draught . there aren 't a lot of squad tactics games available
1,1,with many fun laughs to be had
1,1,a challanging puzzle game . an interesting and fun game !
1,1,delightfully devilish .
1,1,very old school game
1,1,awesome game !
1,-1,as others have said
1,1,.....
1,-1,this game could be awesome with one or two patches . mandatory would be a change to torch duration . i have spent 95% of my points improving torch duration and fuel . sadly every round is still lost due to running out of light . the skill system could be developed further (more skills
1,1,for a couple of bucks this game is still alright i guess . the racing itself is still entertaining
1,-1,boring puzzles and terrible controls
1,1,assassin 's creed rogue is the definition of exploration and adventure ! i really like both black flag and rogue because of the sea / ocean exploration with a ship . now for rogue : story : interesting ! i also like the fact that it fills the gaps of (inside animus of course ) ac 3 's story . you understand the origins of certain characters from from ac 3
1,1,i like this game . it angers me but i take that anger out on my wife so it 's all good .
1,1,all of the crabs .
1,1,sweetest ganking experience everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr !!!!
1,1,great game you get to be a mobster assassin .
1,1,i 'd say this is one of the finest games of its genre but ...it doesn 't really have a specific genre . it 's like talisman
1,-1,you messed up my desktop icon configuration by defaulting your aspect ratio to one which most monitors can not handle . eff you
1,1,edit : changing my review to positive already after the first patch . they fixed some of the glaring problems
1,-1,it is more or less the first game with some updated graphics and implementing a class system . and just like the first game there are a lot of server issues . i liked the first game and this one is fun as well . due to the reboot being too easy so far and all the issues actually getting to play the game
1,1,this game is so coooool man i rlly recomand it !!!
1,1,close your door
1,1,after first game being rather weird and not really fun
1,1,skullgirls is a hella fun game
1,-1,after 0.8 hours of intensive yet adrenaline pumping gameplay i dont approve this game . -too much glitch -bug -poor optimized -another glitch -oh
1,-1,it more dead them mwr . when i got this game i was really hoping to have fun but after bad patches and bad patches the game slowly die . now there like 4-16 player online which make finding a game so hard now .
1,-1,terrible optimisation
1,1,gg
1,1,pretty good game
1,-1,just got killed by a chinese hacker after the 5th anti-cheat update
1,1,early review - 27 hours / level 25 / ~ 33 % completion if you liked the original shadow of war
1,1,a very fun and in-depth gameplay with awesome graphics and awesome music . i still play this game over and over .
1,1,all i think i need to say is that i have 149 hours on this game and that 's considered a tiny amount in this game 's community . i also had played it for months before i bought it (didn't have money at the time
1,1,cool !
1,1,this game has ghosts in it . they can talk to you . the protagonist can be poked . 13/10 keep up the good work spooky doorway !
1,1,such an underrated little gem and for the price it is defiantly worth a play .
1,-1,extremely buggy
1,1,i rather enjoyed playing whispering willows . it is a side scrolling adventure game with an interesting ghost story and good atmosphere . gameplay is light to be sure
1,1,this game takes you for an emotional rollercoaster that i was not prepared for at all . crikey . honestly
1,1,good
1,1,beautiful artwork
1,1,game is good . but not my cup of tee .
1,1,fantastic game
1,1,still one of the best games to play when your bored
1,1,best card game ever !
1,1,a very addicting game . it shows a lot of potential to become really great . the game has a lot of well fleshed out gamemacanics and feels really unique
1,1,when playing this game
1,1,great game but takes a long time to get good !
1,1,i love this game
1,1,i waited for so long for this to come to pc . i have this for ps2 in standard and limited editions
1,1,this is best gaem u should gat oit
1,1,most beautiful (and exaggeratedly challenging ) boss fight simulator ever made .
1,1,definitely different than new lands . would recommend nl over classic
1,1,recommend with some caveats
1,1,nice game
1,1,nice game and a lot of achievements .
1,1,an amazing fps with a focus on quick and seamless slaughtering of demons . its a very satisfying game with an amazing soundtrack to get you into the mood of slaying your demons cause when aren 't you in the mood for slaying demons ? its also very well optimised ..i get framerates between 150-200 (gtx 1070 ) on average ..with 200 being the limit . its smooth and definitely a pc game you should consider picking up as it goes on sale regularly for 15-20 euro . if your thinking of a good single player campaign game ..this game is definitely for you ..although there is multiplayer ..this game is definitely more focused on delivering a good single player experience and it does whole heartedly . if you are still are not convinced
1,1,well made !!
1,-1,ok i finished the game twice and most important think i got this game for free from a giveaway i dont rly think it worth 5 $ cause the gameplay isn 't longer than 30 mins
1,1,early impressions ; graphically it seems the same as my modded skyrim
1,1,i can 't tell if you 're beautiful because i love you too much
1,-1,dead on arrival
1,1,a very nice indie ghosts 'n'goblins/ ghouls 'n'ghosts reinstallment that manages to solve some of their original shortcomings while introducing a fresh and unique setting . overall
1,1,good remake
1,1,intense realistic fps . this game is still action packed however . rounds go quick and there is not a ton of commands to fool with
1,1,(writing this with over 10 hours on non-steam version .) this game is a great little time killer and has a rather large replay variety due to the 18 stages and three different characters . all the stages are different and it really tests and (for me personally ) helps build things like twitch reflexes and timing because
1,1,story
1,1,its a nice game . only problem i have with it is those dream stages that are massive and the movement speed is pretty slow .
1,1,dispite a few minor flaws
1,1,best board game i have ever played .
1,1,please see my curator page for more games that are worth your time info game : this is a hack & slash adventure game . you start every level with a new prisoner with who you can choose new stats . those stats you 'll improve during a dungeon
1,1,hey bezerk studios i cant play this game bcuz i accidentally changed the resuloution can you make the hit boxes bigger ? like very bigger i accidentally changed to 640x100 or something now i cant change resolution . im crying . please
1,1,fun
1,1,i dreamed about such a game since i was seven
1,1,i like it
1,1,an ok short vn
1,1,it 's good
1,1,fun fps / roguelike game . several hours of gameplay .
1,1,it 's melee for furries
1,1,this is probably one of my personal games that qualify for my personal goty . incredibly rewarding
1,1,finally i managed to survive but with my story . only 1 guy survived but it was satisfactor in the end . :) great story / point of view
1,1,i played with the pa system 's heart and got him to nut on me with vhs tapes and got an achievement for it . this mod will give you everything valve wouldn 't.
1,1,flimflang
1,1,change the fate of the known world and rule europe with your pagan family from mali !
1,1,omg
1,1,how do i hide this game from my profile
1,1,one of the best puzzle games i have played . all of the puzzles are unique and challenging .
1,1,it 's life
1,1,for a point and click it 's extremely entertaining . knowing the choice is up to you to find those responsible in a timely manner all without leaking unwanted info .
1,1,beautiful
1,1,the good + the game looked fantastic back when it came out and it still looks great ! + well optimised : runs at 4k with full aniso filter
1,1,a fun little three-part adventure series with a lot of grim
1,1,this is a fun little game . " someone " started playing and thought the aim was to kill the people hanging and promptly let fly as many arrows as they could into the hanging " targets " . " someone " . the actual aim of the game is to target the ropes hanging the victims and set them free from a horrible death and stains in their shorts from being hanged till dead . good as a short pass time but may be more at home on mobile than pc .
1,1,gets boring pretty quick . but so far
1,-1,no spoilers here . if you were raised in an environment of logic
1,1,pretty good . great gameplay
1,1,its a nice game but the reload time it takes so long in some tanks or a type of barrel or something like that stuff but is a nice game
-1,1,for the record i typed this entire review on my phone . this review is gonna be short simple and straight to the point . rocksmith 2014 is like guitar hero and rock band except you have to use a real guitar or bass . this game comes packed with video lessons and exercise from the developers to teach anyone from beginnings to advanced players how to play the very basic 's such as how to hold your guitar how to strum your guitar all the way to to how to do the tapping technique and how to do legato and sweep picking . rocksmith 2014 also includes mini-games that help memorize chords and string skipping techniques etc . you can play any song you want on rocksmith 2014 and on non stop play you just play the song and practice with the riff repeater if you want . the riff repeater is a practicing tool is to practice a song in any way you want such as have the song loop from 0 :56 seconds to 1 :10 so u can work on that specific riff you been trying to learn . score attack is the same thing except if you miss to many notes or chords you will get strikes and on the third strike the song will stop and it will say you failed the song . you get scored on everything you do on rocksmith except session mode and non stop play and can beat your high score or compete on the leaderboards . session mode is where you can customize a jam session to your liking and jam and rocksmith will play along with you at your tempo in the key you choose and more . pro 's -uses real guitars -you can play any song you want . -great tool for beginners and even advanced people that wanna brush up on things they might be having trouble on . -very dynamic game -leaderboards . -great graphics . -con 's none unless you want to get really deep into it . rating - 10/10 amazing amazing amazing game i highly recommend it to any musicians out there or aspiring musicians .
1,1,this may not look like much
1,-1,dont buy it until all episodes are released . shows dont make one episode a time and release them 2 months in between . also
1,1,if tomorrow the end of humanity comes
1,1,single player co-op
1,-1,the best thing about this game was the refund button :). please do not waste your time with this piece of {?} game
1,1,in short : once again
1,1,horror games have trained me well .
1,1,+ good story line . + good graphic (even though this game quite old ) + very fun multiplayer . - should add the fov slider to adjest fov
1,1,gran juego que me hace pasar tiempo .
1,1,keep talking and nobody explodes is a hilarious co-op game about diffusing bombs . one person has the manual
1,1,{?} on ya timeline
1,1,- an intriguing and sometimes dark storyline - music - dialogs - a few challenging puzzles
1,1,supreb game eazy 100% achievements (1700+)!! there is some secret achievements bt super easy to get !! the expected time to complete the game less then 1-2hours !! nice new levels !! you will totally love it !! hope you all enjoy <3 can 't wait for zup ! 4 :p
1,-1,abandoned junk . developer doesnt care about it neither should you . shows up when he " feels " like it
1,-1,rip login servers . you can 't even play the game .
1,1,have to grind small fish to do anything . jokes on you
1,1,ratatat tat
1,1,10/10 it 's peaceful
1,1,great game
1,1,one of the games i really enjoyed playing . interesting story
1,1,really good f2p game !!! addictiv / confusing / 100% agents vs hackers
1,1,it 's epic .
1,1,... creates appetite for more . :)
1,1,years of waiting certainly did pay off . this game
1,1,it 's better than diablo and its free .
1,1,great game for multiplayers . hilarious moments
1,1,best game-cheap-would buy for my entire friends list :)
1,1,very good
1,1,i cried hard asf at the end . good game
1,1,this {?} ing game is by far the best game i have ever play .
1,1,my favourite pixelshit game
1,1,this game is absolutley fantastic . this is a company that i have never been disapointed with . probably because they are not some out of touch developers sitting in a corporate office that have to kiss the feet of some board execs . they get that gamers want to be immersed sometimes
1,1,so this is old school creature-based magic the gathering
1,1,game had its flaws for sure . i realised after that the story is what pulled me through it
1,-1,if you want a neat vr experience
1,1,great game severs are a little bit unstable sometimes .
1,-1,even after all these years of development there is not much to do in the game . after 7 ingame days for example you 've pretty much seen the meat of the game 's mechanics and it becomes very repetitive . the game plays like an application with context menu 's
1,1,fun crafting game .
1,-1,don 't buy is not full game . the game is not full it ends with a cliff hanger and there is no sequel . it was a good game and there is quite a bit to it . however one of the comments posted a response from a dev saying they ran out of money and never finished the game or made a sequel .
1,-1,<url> the base is there for an amazing experience
1,1,a very tiny game
1,1,the graphics are amazing
1,1,it awesome
1,1,very fun game and lots of content 9/10
1,1,good game to waste time
1,-1,don 't buy it . i was sold on this being a souls-like for multi-player by a friend that has the first game . what it is
1,1,this one was a real manly pixel bloodbath and i enjoyed every second of it . highly recommended for people who want a good sidescrolling beat them up with some nice wrestling moves to go along . game has a somewhat messy start and earlier levels are some of the hardest ones imo so don 't judge this book too soo . it gets so much better later on .
1,-1,idk
1,1,bewertung der early-access-version . kurz und knapp : siedler2-cultures-mix im wikingerstil mit zuf ?llig-generierten karten . bedauerlicherweise gibt es kein siedelndes 'feindvolk'
1,-1,some say it 's still out there .... the once great potential this game had ... many have given up and journeyed on .... i really like this game . maybe not what it is now but it 's like an ex that you can 't figure out why the relationship failed and you keep trying but you realize it 's not you ... they changed and maybe they 'll never be what you need again . maybe you can even argue they changed for the objectively worse ... but late at night
1,1,one of the most intimidating games that i played so far . dark souls is an interesting game that its praised for its difficulty
1,1,i 'm no fan of pixel art in modern games and i don 't like rouge like games
1,1,i was looking for some similar game to no man 's sky and what i found in empyrion worth every second of search . despite being in alpha
1,1,it 's true what they say you know ... gregg really does rule and tbh so does everything else about this game
1,1,gr8 serene game
1,1,more like a rogue-like fighting game than a metroidvania style game
1,-1,from eu
1,1,survive this dark world with you 'r friends
1,1,this game is worth $20
1,1,solid mmorpg experience
1,-1,{?} 8 {?} {?} 8 {?} {?} {?} (bug) {?} {?} {?} npc {?} {?} {?}
1,1,i have gotten this game for free . don 't know how
1,1,havent had this much fun cleaning up junk since st13
1,1,worth playing
1,1,awesome game
1,1,really nice visuals and good fun for a couple of hours .
1,1,patch 7.20 so much problems about any bug or game plays <url> <url> <url>
1,-1,terrible . literally worse than a mobile facebook game . avoid .
1,1,great fun . insane action and 80 's and 90 's action heroes . great online and offline .
1,1,i like this game .
1,1,the last decent farcry game in the series
1,1,episode 1 : hella good episode 2 : even better episode 3 : incredible
1,1,steep is a game i found out about quite by chance on steam store . its an ubisoft game so you will be running uplay and steam together unless you buy it elsewhere and use key activation . steep is a mountain sports game . i play it with a controller - i have a wired xbox one controller for pc . you start off with a tutorial which i wont go into
1,1,such a visually appealing and yet eerie game . i played it from start to finish in one sitting
1,1,blee
1,1,+++
1,-1,how to remove all the fun of the game in one update ?
1,1,everything a fnaf lover could ask for . ^-^
1,1,really fun for short pvp sessions .
1,1,poise remastered also why is dsfix $40?
1,1,it 's fun
1,1,i love avoiding social interaction in a game about social interaction
1,-1,the most uncasual br game ever .
1,1,if cyberpunk is currently your thing and half-life 's source engine has always been your thing : then i think you are probably going to find e .y.e. divine cybermancy to be a very interesting game . if a cyberpunk
1,1,pro : saved about $50 on psychology services by talking with milton . con (?): am now a robot .
1,1,it 's not pocket tanks
1,1,i can 't really express it with words how much i love this game . it is very well done
1,1,this game is the bomb ! short but i love the 80 's style aspect and you get to fight dragons with lasers whats not to love !
1,-1,this game sucks no movement keys (wsap)
1,1,just like witcher 3
1,-1,giving this game away is an insult to good free games everywhere .
1,1,jogo insanamente bem feito
1,-1,while i haven 't played a mm game in a while
1,1,i love insomniacs games and playing sunset overdrive again on pc is awesome is runs like butter
1,1,this is the game where you actually understand how hard it is to use a jetpack .
1,1,{?} 1 {?} {?} 1-2-3 {?}
1,1,fun game
1,1,lovely little game . the art is great and matches the screenshots . nice music . menu 's suck . no way to play in 4k
1,1,could it even get better than this ? even more maids new you can {?} even more nekos it 's neko maids !!!! i wish my cat could be like them ...
1,-1,servers are crap
1,1,pros : + totally crazy epic buggy + lots of new items + harder gameplay + tons of side quests cons : - very anti-climatic ending - mediocre story with short duration - many generic side quests - a bit pricey dying light : the following have amazing gameplay . but if you 're looking for the story like
1,1,really neat 2d action scroller
1,1,a nice
1,1,there aren 't that many battle royal games they said ... it 's not that over saturated they said ... at least it 's got snowboarding ?
1,1,probably the best platformer game ever . seriously though
1,1,i love neko girl
1,1,this game feels poorly made at the best of times
1,-1,i regret buying it because i expected more from it and it took so long to set up i couldnt get a refund .
1,1,veri nais
1,-1,no players = unplayable
1,1,i have played the game before while game sharing with a old friend and i loved it ! its fun to play with others too and consitering the sale thats going on buy the game for your self and a friend !
1,1,this game is the spiritual successor to transport tycoon
1,1,great game !
1,1,kathy rain is a witty
1,-1,motion sickness ...
1,-1,how the hell did i get 20 hours
1,1,i miss old map dude ...like cranberry ranchito etc
1,1,this is a good followup game on dishonored . i always enjoyed playing the first game
1,1,byte-sized review the harder you fall ; the heavier your heart ; the heavier your heart ; the stronger your climb ; the higher you pedestal . review celeste really surprised me in so many ways . i knew from the onset that i was getting involved with a very difficult game
1,1,heeeey thats pretty good
1,1,pros : + coop mode + 10 players support + scoreboard + new weapon (lead pipe
1,1,okay
1,-1,xd its fnaf
1,1,not perfect
1,1,best of best
1,1,a game full of dialouges
1,-1,multiplayer not that good
1,1,ok
1,1,simple pickup and play fun
1,1,yo the game is nice and all but everytime the intro starts up i crash pls fix >
1,-1,i really
1,1,i would recommend this game for a few reasons . first of all
1,1,don 't know if i 'm the right person to write this review because i have a soft spot for hog 's. a hog was the first type of game i ever played . read the reviews and i gather this game had a somewhat lukewarm reception . if this is true then i am in for gaming goodness on the other hog 's on steam because i really enjoyed this game . the story was interesting and the puzzles and graphic scenes blended well . all puzzles could be worked without auto finish or looking up solutions on guides . i have a serious problem with how the search list for the ho sections are always too close to objects which can cause you to accidentally hit the something you don 't want to hit . if you like hog 's i 'm sure you 'll like this one though i have played other games like this that left a finer impression on me . i do think it is worth you checking out .
1,1,someone stop me plz <3
1,1,great game
1,1,so far so good but
1,1,im a huge fan boy and this review shouldnt count .
1,1,a thrilling story of lies and deceit that you 'll enjoy riding along with for a good chunk of time . get to know your classmates and search for clues
1,-1,as of the time i 'm writing this review
1,1,the game suffers from some technical issues
1,1,more fun than expected . try it out in a sale .
1,1,picked it from sale . no regrets .
1,1,amazing visuals coupled with calm
1,1,that 's fckn awesome ! brofist !
1,1,this game is good
1,1,fun but many tryhards ..
1,1,this is perhaps my all time favorite video game . that is saying something . that isn 't to call this a perfect game
1,-1,this is not counter-strike nexon : zombies ! this is more like counter-strike nexon : connection terminated
1,-1,they have gone way too far to push the multiplayer .
1,1,pros : + playing as survivors and zombies like contagion + lot of weapons (double-barrel shotgun
1,-1,0.1 hrs
1,1,more death
1,1,better than when i was a kid . very enjoyable .
1,1,highly recommended super fun incredibly immersive easy to learn but with high skill ceiling if you are looking for a game that makes you feel like you are piloting giant robots armed to the teeth look no further
1,1,thanks for the gift
1,1,i thought dark crusade was hard
1,1,c 'est cheeeeeeeeeeeeer . ces dlc quoi mon dieu .
1,1,want a zombie apocalypse ? want to have fun ? does your daughter who might turn into a zombie want a pony ? well tell her ponies are stupid and get her a {?} ing tiger .
1,-1,love the game
1,1,do you like difficult games that require skill and stat managment ? do you like games were you run around with your friends and beat things senseless ? this game has both of those things and so much more ! river city ransom underground is a beat-em-up for 1-4 players (local or online ). story the story takes place several years after the original river city ransom and the gang your character (or characters ) has been accused of kidnapping something merv (the biggest buisiness owner in river city ) holds dear . your goal is to figure out who framed you and maybe even find the true secret behind this city 's biggest secrets . gameplay gameplay is very similar to the original river city ransom with some a sprinkling of modern features like super moves and combos . each character feels different and unique from the breakdancing provie to the boxer paul
1,1,very nice
1,-1,not bad game but not that fun
1,1,it 's a good game
1,1,you get what you paid for
1,1,best game fps all cod
1,1,quite enjoyable
1,1,the game is great . could do without the card based challenges and gameplay
1,1,awesome game
1,1,chivlary : medieval warfare is exactly what it says on the tin . it is pretty much medieval warfare ! swords
1,1,the best point & click game i ever played !
1,1,a pretty short narrative world that makes you ponder about the world you 're living in and its people .
1,1,insanely underrated game . it 's really fun and original .
1,1,this is a fun and relaxing game . you do have to enjoy the basic mechanic in solitaire of flipping cards over and figuring out where to put them
1,1,this game kicks my {?} but it never gets boring
1,1,good game ;-)
1,1,you get what you paid for
1,1,swag ! this game is super awesome ! if you want to have fun just play this game
1,1,this game is an absolute sleeper co-op hit . the story is nonsense
1,1,clean prison fun ! i 'm hoping they add in more content as this is a game worth supporting .
1,1,requires a fix to work on windows 10. see the comments of this review . thanks to lettuce lizard .
1,1,no one was even trying to show another side of children 's minds and what they are coming through . so delighted about gaming process .
1,-1,this game as it stands right now is nothing more than a poorly made bootleg of minecraft . it even has sprites and textures ripped straight from the real game ! the only positive of this game is the free cards
1,1,lots of fun with friends !
1,-1,ravagly murdered
1,-1,===[ graphics : ]=== ? potato . ? really bad . ? bad
1,1,before cup head was q / yo . wacky graphics
1,1,a fun game to have with friends
1,1,buy csgo first
1,-1,all we wanted was half-life 3
1,1,this game is not for everyone . it is fun and enjoyable once you figure it out . cons : 1. no tutorial 2. no highlighting of interactive elements in the dungeon 3. complex character building 4. no hand holding pros : 1. no tutorial 2. no highlighting of interactive elements in the dungeon 3. complex character building 4. no hand holding
1,-1,i bought this thinking it would be as good as rampart (arcade or console ). the controls aren 't nearly the same . you can only use the " wasd " keys and " er " for rotation . and with controllers or a joystick

1,1,sayori is a precious little flower that needs to be loved and protected .
1,-1,{?} ing this game had possibilites to be great . too bad that bethesda is all about money now
1,1,love this game .
1,1,well i love cyberpunk
1,1,it 's ok . plenty of possibilities to solve the puzzles . it 'll be a good one for the kids in a few years to teach them logic and actions and consequences . as for me
1,1,this is a cool game with a lot of potential . my only beef with it at the moment is that if you 're trying to be a commander rather than just running around the battlefield shooting and stabbing (and getting shot and stabbed )
1,1,i 'll start by saying this . " i didn 't like space invaders " . you can all call it what you will
1,1,fun and interesting game !
1,-1,it 's short
1,1,better love story than twilight . better gameplay than fallout 76. i give eight out of five .
1,1,love this game . any chance we could get a ghost of how hard we hit the last ball on the power meter ? would be insanely helpful .
1,1,great story
1,-1,they have done a good job on this game but it seems like they have to more than that
1,1,i need more ...
1,1,buy it
1,1,#63 space rogue what can i say about this one . yep
1,1,i like this game . overkill did a great job creating the feeling of dread within this game . otwd requires a plan or else it will eat you alive . one will pay about $6 a mission at this point of launch with promises of a second season with initial purchase . the graphics
1,1,unbeatable (value for money )!
1,1,zdecydowanie warto kupi ? - ze znajomymi w don 't starve 'a gra si ? jeszcze lepiej i jeszcze zabawniej .
1,1,a heavily qualified recommendation . i 'm a big fan of adventure games and sci-fi . event horizon is one of my favorite scary movies . in sum of which
1,1,after having only played ten minutes
1,1,superior to the first entry but still not perfect . anyhow
1,1,i {?} in love this game aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
1,-1,game has potential just seems abandoned
1,1,this game is beautifully made . if you 're into other games such as terraria or space bound this is perfect for you . i bought the game in early access and it has grown and into a wonderful masterpiece . would recommend if you 're considering .
1,-1,kf 1 master race .
1,1,p good . i like it . :)
1,1,?
1,1,this is the first early access game i have played that i have actually really cared about . i have been excited to see what new things are added and what new features are to come . with the actual realease date coming up
1,1,this is a great puzzle game
1,1,3
1,1,this is dark souls ii ! what else should i say :d
1,-1,personally
1,1,cheap and addictive game !
1,1,can 't speak about any of issues of the latest windows patch as i played it prior
1,-1,ned ? se to hr ?t kdy ? m ?te 5x za sebou hrozny team
1,1,das spiel ist hammer-geil . kauft nur einen uncut-key oder lasst es euch von jemanden aus
1,1,{?} online {?}
1,1,last may you gave me this game but the very next day i didnt want to play this year to save me from tears i 'll lagg stab someone special wham ! - last christmas dr .freze - last may !
1,1,was expecting a cheesy rip off of old geezers who had these dashboards in their childhood combined with graphics from old pole position along with authentic / impossible gameplay . but was surprised to see it contains a real game with achievements in there . nothing big or complex but just enough to try again when you fail . consider me entertained .
1,1,i mean
1,1,i like this game
1,1,first impressions when i first started playing counter strike i was terrible
1,1,some body once told me that scott had made a new game i really should go check it out he told me it wasn 't scary it 's just a tycoon story he 's now inside a greenspringtrapsuit cmon josh
1,1,i have honestly played way too much of this game
1,1,g l o r y t o a r s t o t z k a
1,1,ta gra wzie ?a mnie
1,1,best game ever made
1,-1,the idea of the game is simple
1,1,{?} ps2 {?} {?} {?} {?} {?} 9.2 / 10 {?}
1,1,i like to throw bottles at the combine just to see how far they 'll chase me .
1,1,this is one of the best zombie games i 've played in years . the atmosphere alone is so unique and awesome . the gun mechanics are crazy good . this game is just so perfect . <url>
1,1,very good game
1,1,the most realistic ww2 theme game that is f2p out there
1,1,best survive game ...
1,-1,main quest of the dlc is totally broken
1,1,third time 's the charm (?) fan 's rejoice - the third game of neptunia is here ! other gamers take a peak - another anime-style jrpg is here ! but is it a plain copy of the previous two games
1,1,i still love this one ! :)
1,1,explains the star wars story better than the movies . the characters only communicate through grunts and charades .
1,1,i doubt that this game needs a review
1,1,very fun co-op couch game
1,1,new badges yay
1,1,cuphead is one of the most awesome run 'n' gun games to ever come to its time . sure its hard
1,1,a fun story experience that you 'd probably like if you enjoyed papers
1,1,i can recommend this game . being a stealthy bastard and then sweeping into big melee battles have never been this much fun . i just need to figure out how lorm the hungry managed to come back from decapitation twice within the same 20 minute battle . people claim the game is short but it can be fun to just waste a few hours faffing about . storyline missions ? nah

1,1,this review is appropriate for the 1.04 release as of 2/11/2014. i recently picked up this game on their $1 sale on groupees in be mine 11
1,-1,game is using the spyware redshell - do not download !
1,1,a great game
1,-1,the short version : if you want a repetitive game of cat & mouse
1,1,best gsme ever . the community is really great
1,1,just one more round .... just one more round .....
1,1,if you put the laging issue near the end asside the game is ok . it a basic base defensse follow by a scavenge hunt routine it repetitive but still enjoyable . i advise to buy it on special i frankly dont think it worth it 's full price .
1,-1,b ?yle gereksiz bir oyun yok
1,1,i just finished ether one . it 's a brilliant game with an exceptional story . it reminds me of the adventure games of yore where it is best to take notes
1,1,fantastic game
1,1,how to describe l .a. noire best ? : a love / hate relationship . its story-driven point &click aspect is addictive . on the other side the game itself is a total disaster based on common videogame standards . don 't look for a gta-like or a sandbox game
1,-1,do you like boring fictional text conversations ? do you like jumpscares with absolutely no context or reason ? then this is the game for you !
1,1,great game
1,1,:)
1,1,this game is utterly amazing . it 's best enjoyed barely knowing anything about it . it is one of my favourite games of all time ! here 's some quick pros and cons . pros : ~cute characters (especially the main character ) ~good music ~some replay value (the only game ever after i finished it i then went straight to replaying it ) ~stunning visuals . everything is so gorgeous ! ~mysteryyyyy~ cons : ~i want more !
1,-1,tumblestone is the first original action-puzzle game of the past fifteen years . [citation needed ]
1,1,let me start with this
1,1,i could have {?} ing babies with this game 10/10 but it kicks the {?} out of you .
1,1,a pure classic . this was my first game on pc
1,-1,ufjck
1,1,game is so fun with zombie survival just get it and you 'll see
1,1,rigged .... i beat that record ...
1,1,maybe the best game about arkham .
1,1,i loved it . the story is extremely well done and will catch you . the gameplay is not awsome
1,1,this game is cool
1,-1,what 's the fun in playing a game that you can 't win ?
1,1,this could be a movie ! the most interesting aspect of technobabylon is its story . it 's not quite like anything else
1,1,despite it being a few years later
1,-1,this is the worst table i own . it appears to be completely random and the ball doesn 't flow or react to the flippers as well as other tables . the ramps are stupidly placed and the ball movement is either too fast or slows quickly for no reason . there are loads of better tables for pinball fx2 and i would purchase them before getting this . much as i appreciate deadpool as a marvel character (and the use of all four flippers which this wastes !) this table lets him down ... the wolverine table is ten times better ! poor design 3/10
1,-1,the loading is so long
1,-1,the bosses are creative and i love the art style
1,1,ein sehr gutes spiel muss ich sagen . habe schon lange nach einem guten f2p rpg spiel gesucht das so gut ist . ein nette grafik und sehr gutes gameplay . bei der steuerung ist auch nichts auszusetzen . pros : -gute grafik -nette story -riesiger skill tree der auf jeder klasse gleich ist -kein pay2win cons : -ist nunmal nur auf englisch ist aber kein gro ?er kritikpunkt -manchmal sind die server so highping dass ich nicht drauf spielen kann ( ist zurzeit nicht mehr so der fall ) im gro ?en und ganzen gebe ich das spiel 10 von 10 punkten .
1,1,this and lonesome road are tied for my favourite dlc they are just so good . for $5 you really can 't go wrong . a really great interesting lead character
1,1,i don 't usally get visual novels
1,1,why prestige for an extra slot when you can get 25 slots for real monies !
1,1,this game is awsome !!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,1,i like this game
1,1,rts distilled
1,1,flip flip flap boooom !
1,1,red faction : armageddon still offers beautiful and amazing destructions as they were in red faction : guerilla
1,1,if you are wondering if you should grab primordia you should first know it comes from wadjet eye games . if you don 't know wadjet eye games i would suggest just go ahead and grab every game they made . if you like point and click games you should just go ahead and play everything they released . prob the best company out there still making them .
1,-1,a very basic and simple 3x3
1,1,good game ! good game ! good game ! chat has been disabled for 3 seconds .
1,-1,pros cheap entertaining for the first few minutes multiplayer singleplayer / coop campaign cons muddy graphics (even by 2010 standards ) really clunky controls repetitive nearly not worth the price don 't buy it . honestly
1,1,been itching to play it again which makes it so good
1,1,what does one look for in a point-and-click puzzle game ? *good writing ? check . likeable characters
1,-1,bad ports seem to be the new normal around here . i 'm done . anyone wanna buy my rig ?
1,1,ying waifu best waifu
1,1,cybarian is a neat action platformer where you 're a time travelling barbarian and you teleport into a cyberpunk style future and have to kick some butt . i has solid gameplay that feels great on the 360 style pc controller and is very responsive . the game is based a lot on timing
1,1,played this game when it was a free flash game (on kongregate
1,1,1 minute %100 speed run with all achievements ! had to wait 4 more minutes just to write this review ... not worth it lol
1,1,its ok
1,1,introduction you take control of a group of survivors and use their skills to barricade windows and doorways
1,-1,the selling points of this game are : caring for a child in critical condition
1,1,i love this game well done guys ! brings me back to the amiga
1,1,i love this game it has a lot more then the same thing over and orer agian . it is freeee im shore mr . krads would take advantis of this . and it cepes on giting diveliped more and more by the crators of the game . it is not eving a pay to win game . and it is cool coll caritors good grafiks and moreeeeeeeeeeeee . i recommend this game warframe . you must by it .
1,-1,globally censored just for china . do not buy .
1,1,i never expected to get into this game as much as i did . i expected to make a casual run with one character and call it a day
1,1,:v
1,1,a must play
1,1,guidelines to enjoy the game : - inherently enjoy wc3/sc / sc2 custom map tower defense games - wait for release server stress to get fixed review of the game in contrast to wc3 mod - respected the original game and its features and improved on them - ui and gameplay improvements to focus on towers - graphical improvement and balance changes
1,1,a calming train track management game that gets more frantic as it goes on . 8/10 pros : + beautiful minimalist style + easy to pick up + different modes and maps + calming if you play endless mode + came cheaply in a humble bundle ($1) + makes you interested in real train map styles to improve your own maps + circles cons : - hard to master (over 1000
1,-1,this is an ambitious game and there are several things that i admire in it
1,1,i loved the story about fran and if you like these kind of story driven games i think you might really enjoy this one . the dialogues are great and it is a bit scary
1,1,dmc is fiercely creative
1,-1,if it looks like an asset flip
1,1,finished all stages in 10 hours 11/10 would get rejected by my friends for brain damage again .
1,1,a very unique game . i can only assume by 2021 the indie game market will be packed full of time travelling whodunnit insurance simulators .
1,-1,i standing in one place and i killing dumb bots . random noob is kicked me . reason : idling . gg
1,1,its a great game 10 out of 10 ign and iv had the game for 2 days
1,1,ohhh boi
1,1,old but gold
1,1,we do not deserve this masterpiece .
1,-1,this game isn 't an adventure
1,1,nice puzzle game with really cool theme . it was really nice to play through my childhood horror movies
1,1,this game is just great ... enough said
1,1,on the positive side this is basically kill bill the game . swords
1,1,simply put : an underrated gem . lisa is an rpg with dark humor
1,1,if you enjoy passpartout : the starving artist but want more to do and being able to view other peoples art and even sell to them . the ui is easy to work with and if you 've ever made a piece of art with mspaint or photoshop then you are ready to make your masterpiece in painter 's playground . colors
1,1,thomas was alone is a very clever puzzle platformer . who would have thought that tiny shapes could have so much personality . for such a simple game it was quite entertaining and satisfying .
1,1,such a strange game
1,1,love the game
1,1,although this game did change to free to play im quite happy even though i did pay full price finally i will be able to play with some people (idk why they did it but {?} it ) i rate it 7/10 i like playing one mode even if its just getting hunted makes me wanna watch jurrasic world again
1,1,pros : - fun with friends - tournament mode cons : - ugly - there 's a knife
1,1,1.the game is so good 2.the musics are awesome 3.the graphic is amazing 4.the ork reaction and memory are sooooooooooo fun 5.the online challanges and online revange and conquer mission are good buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut @monolith produtction pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee bring online conguer overlord speech in the game i need to listen to overlord speech before the attack please please please please please please please and creat a third game for middle earth <3 love u guys
1,1,bunny girls fairies lesbianism . 10/10
1,1,the 25th anniversary patch for this game fixed all the issues that come to mind . truly a masterpiece .
1,1,great atmosphere with some great shooting action where you can meet players and teamup to complete pve missions against decent ai or fight other players in the dark zone . - collect different colour-coded raries of gear & guns . - tailor your abilities to fill different roles . - snowy
1,1,the new maps and story scenarios are a very enjoyable addition to an already great game
1,1,ish good i liek vvvv much
1,1,i remember when
1,1,looks like crysis 3 plays like gta sounds like rainbow six siege 11/10 best game so far
1,-1,valve what have you done to tf2. ....
1,1,so my dudes
1,-1,the good : ======= + the art is super cute (dat live2d tho ) + ost is good + ui is clean and fluid + cheap the bad : ====== - painfully bad translations . (" since i cried so server that time
1,1,i remember hating this game . it 's weird learning curve
1,1,i beat this game when it first came out and i was only 11 years olds . that being said i have extreme nostaligia glasses on . this was my very first rpg and it is what got me hooked on rpgs to this day . therefor
1,1,issa gud gaem
1,-1,*update* (1/4/2017) game still runs like absolute doody . seems like it is a lot more prevalent in the discussions as well . maybe one day ... *update* (11/25/2016) unfortunately ended up refunding this . hopefully when i look back into it in a couple months all the kinks will be worked out . here 's hoping you have better luck than i did if you buy this . ---original review--- of the 1
1,1,this game is one of the best games deep silver
1,1,like fez
1,1,<url>
1,1,low-fi graphics but filled with meaty substance . this is the best of this kind of game on the market .
1,1,i like this game :]
1,1,violence breeds violence but in the end it has to be this way ...... 11/10
1,1,imagine me and you
1,1,very good game pretty neat i really liked the crafting feature
1,1,a decent time-killer for the price of ...nothing? sing me up !
1,1,first
1,1,i love this game . i 'm very picky about arpgs and little is needed to make me not play a game . this one has everything - 4 classes with multiple skill trees
1,1,does what it says on the tin .
1,-1,{?} ing server connection keep lost connection from uplay .but dont have issue for other games
1,1,any idea what " doujin " are ? neither did i
1,1,great game
1,1,really enjoyed the story
1,1,with the theme of dr . mario
1,1,still needs a little bit of work but that 'll come over time
1,1,who among you shall die today ? those are the words which are often said after the main menu loads . you should prepare ..... mordheim is a turn based tactical combat game . the goal of the game is to start off as a rag tag bunch of mercenaries and survive the city of the damned leveling up
1,1,this game is amazing . it is different almost every time you play it
1,-1,good proof of concept
1,1,this is an extremely fun game the controls are simple and done right ( you can map them yourself . the mechanics for the on screen items was really nice but switching items from the menu was a little awkward but you get used to it . as for gameplay and fighting its very responsive and tight controls which works with the kind of game this is . the pixel are of this game is really nice and well done . the music is something i really enjoyed
1,1,el super smash bros de steam
1,1,i really hate mobas but this game is a lot of fun . really like this game . :)
1,1,raw sauce .
1,1,legalzinho
1,1,i 've written one before but w .e... . i still love this game .. easy and useful .. most of the pilots and non pilots were .been thru this ...
1,1,absolutely stunning gameplay and soundtrack ! i really enjoyed to play through the whole thing .
1,1,maybe one of the best war games :)
1,1,2d splinter cell
1,1,so far
1,1,huge potential and very good and funny gameplay
1,1,.
1,1,yeah dude .
1,1,i can 't get the theme music out of my head . 10/10 would reject jorji again
1,1,{?} ps2 {?} npc {?} {?} {?} 25-30 {?} {?} {?} 1 {?} {?} {?} {?} {?} ps2 {?} pc {?} 9.5 / 10 {?} 2018 {?}
1,1,fantastic game
1,-1,this game turned into absolute dog {?} after they added shovel knight . trash game .
1,-1,this game is totally fun without the need for gambling or skins why even play !?!?
1,-1,if u want to play this game never try in it dont enchant ever the enchanting system is complete {?} never enchant u will lose a lot of money time and effort in the end u will be mad and quit and game is pretty boring nothing special after u get good gear only pvp bad game
1,1,best game i think
1,1,it 's pretty great to see a game where the beautiful screenshots are actually what you get in the game . that is
1,1,i greatly enjoy this game . i 've sunk a ton of time into many rogue-lites and this game will certainly take a ton of my time as well .
1,1,fun game .
1,1,i really love this game and forgive it for all of it 's 90 's - ness . something about this game makes me feel like a kid again
1,1,did not contract aids after playing . 11/10 would run again
1,1,bastion is a great game and a must have for anyone who likes advernture and acton . the sound track is awsome
1,1,i 've loved this game from the first time i booted it up . the randomness of the map and the strategy a user will need to complete it through the end keeps me coming back time and time again .
1,1,negatives : this game has some silly bugs . i would really appreciate if they would fix them . examples : sound only plays voice . no ambient
1,1,this game has come along way since the kickstarter and is still being updated . i recommend this if your a fan of breaking bad or just a fan of old school strategy games .
1,1," this game needs to be more like cod !" my favorite insurgency joke ;) this is a very promising project
1,1,comparing civ 's famous " one last turn " to factorio 's " right after i do this " is like comparing drinking coffee to snorting horse tranquilizer .
1,-1,infuriating garbage where the jumping physics is nonsense . that is certainly not the worst part though ... this garbage has no story of interest
1,1,wonderfully surreal platformer
1,1,havent tried the game yet
1,1,moxxi ! why !?!
1,1,what the {?} am i doing with my life ?
1,1,gg
1,-1,game is a bit dated . i would wait for the next one to come out at this point .
1,1,this games makes me want to have a seizure
1,1,fun minesweeper like game . ge this version for the infinite mode .
1,1,do i recommend this ?!?! yes a million time yes !!! ok . i 'm no fan of the series so if this feels like it doesn 't belong in it ... well who cares ?!?!?! this game has everything done well or better !!! the action
1,1,i love this game : great combat system
1,1,this game is all goooood it 's like a panettone
1,1,this is what i always expect from a roguelike
1,1,playing this makes me think they actually shipped the wrong version last year . graphics aside
1,1,a super fun and exciting game that isn 't as well known as it should be !
1,-1,buggy as hell
1,1,american oppression of other civilizations simulator 10/10 would invade
1,1,a quintessential vr experience . pros : - the sense of immersion is excellent - the graphics and physics are great - its one of the few totally kids-friendly vr games that they wont get bored of (possibly ever ). cons : - getting that gold bear out of the claw machine is as tricky as real life in short : get it .
1,-1,the game is surprisingly boring . i love this type of game
1,1,good {?}
1,1,it does not have a complicated puzzle
1,1,best toy car racing game for little children of the decades ! best local play . would recommend 367 days a year .
1,-1,scrap describes this game good .
1,1,muito divertido e fixolas
1,1,nice game maybe even the best fps game that i saw before
1,1,nice game
1,1,good game
1,1,a great remaster . - the graphics upgrade is nice - being able to listen to the old bgm is a nostalgic blessing - 2x or 4x speed is ungodly useful . 2x for travel and 4x for farming is definitely my recommendation . if you played the old one on ps2 a little has changed with regards to the licences
1,1,ozmafia <3
1,1,steampunk theme
1,1,amazing game
1,1,the sequel to " sunrider : the mask of arcadius ." this game plays much the same as the first title
1,1,get out of here stalker !
1,1,play as a cute princess girl . burn your enemies alive with magic . release a kraken and feed it people to save your kingdom . die from chocolates . 15/10 - suggest to all my friends even in death .
1,1,much dying
1,1,my second love .
1,1,this game is an amazing tactical fps that requires teamwork and efficient planning to complete the objective
1,1,nice game .. but u need to either 1-get toxic or 2-get anti-toxic antibiotic ... ~ an advice from a pharmacist
1,1,why do i waste my money on trash
1,1,10/10 game of the century . multiplayer valhalla achieved . 600 + hours in
1,1,i don 't know if i can eat shrimp anymore .
1,1,fun to play with friends . the survival aspect was thrilling and engaging . i would recommend this to any survival gamer .
1,-1,cs :go was my favourite game but than comes the 7 days trade ban update .game is full of cheaters
1,1,classic rts that can not be missed . its hardcare difficulty will bring you down to your kness lol
1,1,while i am leaning towards giving this a negative review ...the " eldritch moon " update promises to fix most of the problems i have with this game . online match making seems to be working better now ...but i would really like to use " coins " to unlock cards instead of getting random cards . oh well ...it is free to play and can kill some time .
1,1,i like all the toasters that i can pick up . 10/10 snails agree .
1,1,that was awesome !
1,1,best game .
1,1,i can not express just how much i enjoy this game . my heart has always belonged to the wounders of space
1,1,maybe it 's because i skipped rise because it seemed too similar to the original
1,1,for every type of person there 's the one game out there that really fits for him . this game however appeals to various sorts of players
1,1,e
1,1,who made this game and why ?
1,-1,the graphics were good
1,1,this is the best hitman game yet . the levels are detailed with so many alternate route and kill methods . the mastery challenges
1,1,oh yes ! the witcher 2 nails your fat gamer {?} in front of your computer and solidifies the franchise as the best fantasy themed rpg series ever ! it 's a boner inducing tour de force that will grab you by the nuts and shrink them to the size of raisins ! the environments have a handcrafted feel to them making them far superior to anything that has come before ! also : there are b00bs ! and hairy dwarves !
1,1,if you enjoy bloody games this is your game 10/10 would bleed again .
1,1,this game was super-frightening for me when i was a kid but i realize now it is not scary at all - and the game is quite easy . story line is good and combat is alright . i recommend playing this game on short periods because the " dos-graphics " make you feel disoriented . controls are borky and should be played with a joystick . pick this game up if you don 't mind the graphics and want to experience a good sw story .
1,1,perfectly reasonable port but probably better streamed so you can enjoy it sitting back on a couch in front of a larger screen .
1,-1,no dedicated servers . lobby makign doesnt work half the time . 80% of the time there are connection issues . and the single player is a glorified tutorial . do not buy this game
1,1,it took awhile to get into the solitaire
1,-1,a bad game yet addictive
1,1,it 's scary
1,1,bro . this game for bros . best of bros . worst of bros . bro .
1,1,less enjoyable if you lost both hands
1,1,so .. this is danganronpa v1 demo :v {?}
1,1,not as horrible as everyone makes it out to be . may be nostalgia talking
1,1,i was blown away by the experience

1,1,this is such a cute little alien platformer . i completed the game in about an hour
-1,1,the biggest attraction of this game is that it 's made for the pc and not just some multi platform paid dlc by the numbers modern game . that is instantly apparent when you load it up . this game launched without a ridiculous season pass or any mention of paid dlc . there is no horrid crafting that now plagues seemingly every game in existence . this game is like a time capsule when games were made by gamers and everything wasn 't designed for paste eating illiterate console gamers . the ui is stylish and uses the whole screen . you actually get an inventory and sorting features and you don 't have to click 15 times to bring up a comparison between gear . there are no nerdy data logs sitting everywhere explaining the lore of how elves take a dump in the woods . there are things you can read if you want but these are interesting or relevant to where they are such as a note from a dead person next to their corpse . it 's not some primer on the organization of the ruling council of the nerd kingdom you 'll never come across in the game . this brings up one of the greatest strengths on this game as it doesn 't try to overwhelm you with nerd lore . dialogue makes sense and isn 't boring nerd explanations . this is made even better by the excellent voice acting in which you won 't be cringing over even if the character is swearing . did i mention that the white wolf himself is one of the main character voice ? that doesn 't hurt either . i like this game . it reminds me of the good old days of pc gaming where everything wasn 't designed around trying to limit players to spend more money . i don 't feel the need to rush through the game or overthink the mechanics of the game . i can load it up
1,1,great game worth every hour of playing . if you are into simple not complicated 2d space shooters it 's game for you . there 's a lot of humor mainly in text (unfortunately) but it won 't make this game worse . fully customizable ships . you can equip your ship as you like it : (engines
1,1,good !
1,1,this game is an engaging intersection between and artists ' works and the artist themselves . all i can say without spoiling it
1,-1,wargaming puts another dumbed down version if its prime cash cow on steam . there 's still fun to be had
1,1,as a slav (bulgarian) i have to say that if you re not slav you wont like this its rly good game though my fav mode was the balkan 10/10 would sqaut again . im squating again now btw
1,1,yes
1,-1,from the little time that i played
1,1,just one of the best rpg 's ever made - this game has it all : story
1,1,highly recommend this game to any open worl shooter enthusiasts .
1,1,awesome game
1,1,another one of those gems that have a fun single player mode but is let down by it 's multiplayer . like most open world games
1,1,this game is hard . it is frustrating
1,1,this game is just {?} in good so go slap it on your desktop and have a grand old time .
1,1,a fun puzzle game
1,-1,overall it 's a pretty good rts game
1,-1,explosionade is an arcade style co-op 2d shootemup where you control a giant robot
1,1,best game that i 've ever played . i even made a tatto about this game . a man chooses
1,1,the sequal to the original dead space game is good if not better in almost every aspect . dead space 2 continues the story of dead space 1 except isac clark not stranded on a ship anymore he 's stranded on a space station instead . even better he suffers from a form of dementia plaguing his mind and threatens to kill him in the form of his old wife nicole (lovely isn 't it ). new characters are introduced in dead space 2 nolan stose who suffers from the same syptoms and dementia isacc does
1,1,this was a great game concept that died really fast .
1,-1,great game
1,1,ohhh uh ohh aa a furry main character better throw this game in the tra- waait but wait its actually pretty ok like come on man dont be so closed minded i know you dont like furries but come on its got a story and its like cool and stuff and- ok fine whatever {?} ing jeez i dfontt evenk like thghhis gameeee aaa thats the end {?} boringgggggggggggggggggggggg ohn wait theres more ? woa this is kind of really cool liek dthis game yayyyy its 4am an i played this game 7 hours streaigt to completion . fun time and likable characters (unless yuo reeeeally have something aagainst furries ). if you like meticulous and somewhat boring gameplay in exchange for a nice 4th wall breaking story (which in this case
1,1,deceptively addictive and an amazing amount of content for the price . level layout that invokes memories of the original the legend of zelda on the nes combined with gruesome enemies and permadeth kept me inching towards both unlocking a larger and larger arsenal of possible equipment and seeing the conclusion of the delightfully twisted narrative .
1,1,a fun little idle game that you can play a few times a day or even once .
1,-1,fun game ruined by horrible administrators and free to play first of all
1,1,it 's an achivement machine !
1,1,>when i first played for an hour i got hooked by its gameplay
1,1,do you want to understand programation in games
1,1,for those who have the time and patience to learn something new each time they use it
1,1,imagine if old gta games
1,1,10/10 nice masochist game
1,1,everything about this game is great . creepy and great ambience ? check . strategy and planning ? check . on-point artstyle ? c h e c k . mod support ? yes boi . a game which makes you rage and makes you feel rewarded when not {?} ing up . not only your fellow soldiers will get stressed . you must foresee that you are going to get stressed out along with them . horror ? stress . no shovels ? stress . monsters getting lucky crits ? stress . afflictions ? stay stressed . vanilla experience is good . modded experience is equally good without any mechanic changing mods . dlcs make it better . should you get it ? yes . just wait for discount . should you get the dlcs ? debatable
1,1,nais nais very nais gaim
1,-1,it really pains me to leave a negative review on this . the art design and assets are top-notch and reeks w40k out of every orifice . unfortunately the game itself isn 't anywhere near as polished to the point of frustration . - no dedicated servers . matchmaker displays no ping or useful information whatsoever to tell you the quality of the host . oh and if you disconnect
1,1,thank " @binh long " give me this game . that game so cool . nice game .^^ cam on anh nhe '

1,1,gta5 is possble one of the best games i have ever played and one of the best open world games i have ever played as well because there is so much to do and so much to see . the game lets you play as 3 characters
1,1,very few games are as addicting as this one . i 've put in plenty of hours
1,1,absolute masterpiece . 10/10. i thank the developer for helping me find de whey .

1,1,game is basically a slasher like metal gear rising but with with high doses of lsd nonsense . play it only when you are completely drunk or after having some magic mushrooms
1,1,clem ! grakata !
1,1,this game is a stunningly beautiful and breathtaking adventure through various underwater environments . the game utilizes the full spectrum of colors across multiple environments
1,-1,i have tried this a few times now . loaded up fine

1,-1,absolutely no appeal in this game . boring

1,1,i can 't believe donald trump became president
1,1,wait ... she knows that her own era is called viking age in the future ? that makes the realism a little doubtful . ;)
1,1,this game was on sale and i heard it was good . i like it for a casual lad back shooter its really fun !
-1,-1,[this review has been censored by the people 's republic of china ]
1,1,i dont even own this game .. but hello all :)
1,1,do you remember what happen in the other games ? sure you do ? even if you guess what 's going to happen
1,1,pretty entertaining " rogue lite " shmup here . you have a charming old school filter you can toggle on and off ( but why turn it of f ) to make the screen lo liek a terrible old vhs tape . i love it . the gamplay is decent
1,1,if your a fan of old-school point and click adventures then this game is for you . it has fantastic voice acting
1,1,just die over and over again while listening to the best gaming music . why are you still reading
1,1,i love it

1,1,i remember back in endless space when major dlc that added new factions and gameplay mechanics was free . oh
1,-1,don 't buy this game until it is finished like the rest of bethesda 's modern work . if they can sh *t out a main series fallout game and a vr port knowing the modern public will eat it up
1,1,an amazingly fun game if you have local friends to play it with . the manic
1,-1,totally unimpressed by this game . the usual generic zombies
1,1,this game was a pleasant little surprise for me . originally designed for mobile phones
1,1,{?} {?}
1,1,this may be my favorite game to play . on occasion
1,1,i like that
1,1,great visuals
1,1,its a really good game with a good story
1,1,do i even have to say about this dlcs .......this company has surpassed others in showing what it means to make " real " dlc ...not those who charge $$ every min even for single decorations .
1,1,don 't listen to all the nay sayers . if you liked payday +l4d you most likely will love this one . you can level your characters
1,1,simply a masterpeice
1,1,this game is very realistic
1,-1,broken achivement .
1,1,well
1,-1,dont have servre arabe !!
1,1,this time around the grappeling and swinging around like tarzan has been ommited . but free look camera on the right thumb stick has been added and it helps out a lot in combat and discovery . my first playthrough it had been some time since i played the previous los . i knew the story must take place in a modern / future setting but i had hoped they would find a way around it so it wouldn 't feel corny . in a way they did and it was pretty genius . it did feel a bit corny the first playthrough but after some time and recently replaying through los and mirror of fate i found much more to be appreciated in los2 and enjoyed it quite a lot . peicing together the story accross the games was a lot of fun as well . there are so few action / adventure games made these days ; and fewer still that are worth playing . the los trilogy is quite good and worth owning for fans of the genre . los gameplay draws a lot from god of war and some from shadow of the colossus with a good sprinkle of classic metroidvania . the expeience and skill tree system i quite prefer in this game if i am to have one . the moves you use are the ones you gain experience in
1,1,wasn 't expecting much when i got this game . really ended up enjoying it a lot . reminded me a little of shan gui and go ! go ! nippon ~my first trip to japan ~ with the interesting facts about the area in japan plus there culture . including story of 3 girls that seem to be more well thought out then some of the other vn 's that i read . would go into more detail but that would ruin the story . would reccomend to anyone that has a interest in vn 's or japan !
1,1,as soon as i saw that you could play the game as the blacksmith
1,1,full controller support
1,-1,a lot of people have moved from console to pc
1,1,i nominated this for the i'm not crying
1,1,crimes ?
1,1,a fantastic game to play casually with a friend on the couch . the pace and the level design is perfect for adults that don 't have 14 hours a day to play games . they don 't repeat the mechanic formula just to fill up game hours . that 's so rare these days . wonderful soundtrack .
1,1,a flawed
1,-1,you have to pay real money for saveslot you have to pay real money for boosts to decrease the grind you have to pay real money for multiplayer emotes you have to pay real money if you want to manually defend each wave of base camp digs one after the other without having to wait a day inbetween each wave you have to always be online so during said waves even if your connection or their trash servers fail for half a millisecond you get booted out and lose everything go gas yourself konami you bunch of greedy backstabbing jews i am never ever touching anything made by konami ever again i already paid full release price for the game

1,1,this game is probably the best game in the world . who need a girl friend am i right ? this game gets your blood boiling knowing that if you mess up there goes your chance to get laid . this game also gives you life lessons on how to get women . before i played this game i was a nobody

1,1,best oyun .
1,1,11/10 would forget how to hack npc locs again
1,-1,you have to give the book to denny or else the game doesn 't end . {?} ing {?} t .
1,1,i had a lot of fun playing this little horror rogue-like . the game doesn 't last that many hours but i 've had fun replaying it to get the good ending . i also must congratulate the dev on the teleportation mechanic that 's pure awesomeness to play with .
1,1,ba
1,1,ridiculos does not even begin to describe this game . like surgeon simulator minus the sugery .
1,-1,the game do have a potential but the desync made this game unplayable . this has been the issue since it was first launched and never had an update for this fix . playing this game for 200 + hrs and only have 7 chicken dinners . quitiing this game now and maybe will be back until they fix the desync and server performance . overall
1,1,prettty decent game to kill sometime
1,1,enjoyable train game focusing purely on the steam age . very nice graphics and maps . doesn 't have the complexity or realism of games like transport fever
1,1,this is a pretty solid turn-based strategy game
1,1,wew game . i feel scary zzz .................................................................
1,1,hekticly hektik
1,1,look i could explain to you in depth about how the gameplay is so fluid you always feel as if you are in control of every second . i could say how the artistic style of this game is the most beautiful thing i have seen from any indie game

1,1,gorgeous pixel art
1,1,shokugeki no soma
1,-1,a terrible game . many people have listed its many problems
1,-1,i thought this would be an interesting game to pick up
1,-1,thought i 'd try it due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews . the angry chickens need to announce themselves ever so slightly earlier as i died very often to jumping down only to be perfectly timed to run into them with nothing i can do about it . what is the point in health (pantsu) if nearly everything one shots you ? the game is cute and has that distinct japanese flare i love but i can 't recommend this one .
1,1,blender >> autodesk 3ds max
1,1,bought this yesterday for the 50% off along with the dlc . good graphics
1,1,if you like the single player version
1,1,fun but short little twin stick shooter if you get it on sale . some levels really depend on the gun / perks you get .
1,1,i considered this is a good remake . it 's reminded me the good old times . +pros - character creation system - many teams not only the 4 old teams - add the story to the game -cons - i want to jump with 2 buttons as in the nes version
1,1,got 100% off on some random day . loose controls but still fun gameplay . pretty linear
1,-1,this game could be very good but this rng .... u {?} ed up
1,1,i 've had a lot of fun playing this

1,1,fun with strangers
1,1,awesome game to play with ur bestie or brotheri
1,1,the game is like raking a zen-garden . still as strange and wonderfull as when it was first released
1,-1,every mission feels the same
1,1,byte-sized review groundhog day she wrote review in under a minute omensight is the new game from spearhead games - who previously gave us the action rpg stories : the path of destinies and the co-op action puzzler tiny brains - cements them as an indie studio to watch . billed as an action murder mystery
1,1,very awesome so far ! can 't wait for the game to be finished
1,1,hauntingly atmospheric game with stunning animation
1,1,ootp16 is the baseball game for all of the armchair gms / managers out there . there have been quite a few improvements to ootp since my last purchase (ootp10) and the obvious change is the mlb license . for those unfamiliar with the series
1,1,it 's a fun turn-based puzzle-adventure
1,1,reminded me of good ol days :)
1,1,money money and more money {?}
1,1,the patch they put out for the 25th year anniversary edition is absolutely phenomenal . this game works flawlessly on modern hardware now
1,1,i purchased overcooked : gourmet edition during a steam sale . overall
1,1,great game
1,1,fun and addicting . this game of course wont appeal to everyone but for those who enjoy games like stardwew velley they will enjoy this one as well . ( i am sorry for not putting much into this review at the moment
1,1,wonderful puzzle game
1,1,this game is just awesome :d
1,-1,i saw the game leave early access so i thought i might as well give this a shot
1,1,the long and short of it is that this game is good . simple . having played monster hunter : freedom unite for the psp and monster hunter tri for the wii i can wholeheartedly say this experience doesn 't disappoint . since this is my only exposure to the monster hunter series this is the basis from which i 'll judge this game . the additions and changes made to the series work well together
1,1,great game .
1,1,i played this game sarcastically .
1,1,best karaoke game i 've played 10/10
1,1,amazing music
1,1,i flung a gun around and killed my friend
1,1,extremely amazing game . i own this game for quite a while and i love it ! hell
1,1,not bad but not great either . the achievements are not achievements at all and the levels were sometimes not ordered in increasing difficulty . i would give it 6/10.
1,1,tbh
1,1,game costs rp .1000
1,-1,relaxing game but not a game that keep me playing while there is lot of game i have waiting to be played . not recommend for a gamer looking for story

1,1,conga conga conga !
1,1,great game
1,1,play with friends or suffer .
1,1,video review : <url> fluffy horde is pretty good . the levels are fairly challenging with a good mix of strategies . the objective is similar (and get can get weird !) but the way you complete it changes . a simple example is how the game might limit you from building certain units . the levels are really short and i really like how even though the game dishes out three medals at the end for completing a level in a certain way it doesn 't stop you from progressing . thank you ! anyway
1,1,i was really excited when i picked this game up . all the lps i watched and just the buzz around it was phenominal . when i actually purchased the game
1,1,imagine a game that takes the wordless storytelling
1,1,besides being plagued with {?} decisions (such as restarting the mission entirely whenever a host leaves
1,-1,i only have a half hour in this game because it felt like a gimmicky platformer . after that
1,1,great with friend
1,1,nice
1,1,clash royale on pc
1,1,final fantasy vii .!.with achievements and minor changes .. need i say more ?

1,1,back to my childhood . and no brother to share !
1,-1,so this performance test tells me that my pc is not ready at all ... and only because of my gpu ... ... an nvidia geforce titan x . better upgrade then .
1,1,this is the most frustratingly fun game i think i 've ever played .
1,1,probably the best storytelling
1,1,what is life again ? who knows
1,-1,i really like the games art style and was really looking forward to playing it but it is clear the game is not finished . from missing button icons to menu strings . while the game is playable there is so much in the way between the player and having a good time .
1,1,sit back
1,1,this is more addictive than i expected .
1,1,ilmasta xp
1,1,i actually like this game and play it with friends
1,-1,the game is f2p

1,1,great game a must play
1,1,i forgot to write a review for this game
1,1,trucks and parkour . combining the two was easy . beating the result is the hard part .
