https://steamcommunity.com/id/cockieschan/recommended/252950,1, Really fun game to play with friends 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/shahruk96/recommended/220240,1, One of the best games I have ever played. Nothing more to say. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/cockieschan/recommended/440,-1, THis game was fun, until people started trying hard in casuals.  Where are my good ol' days in hightower where everyone used the rocket jumped trying to shovel everyone, smh.  Game went on a ?????? path. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/shahruk96/recommended/311210,1, The infinite warfare beta made me appreciate this game ALOT more. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/cockieschan/recommended/657200,1, Cried so much from laughing. Recommend it with friends if you play it alone, you are a sad kid and should unninstal this game. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/cockieschan/recommended/578080,-1, Waste of money 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/cockieschan/recommended/333600,1, Ayy, who doesn't like some cute catgirls? Also very nice hentai 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/shahruk96/recommended/292030,1, As of writing this I have just finished the campeign of the Witcher 3, it took a total of 91 hours of quality storytelling. The game itself has great graphics and a great combat system. The world of Witcher 3 is immersive and all the characters are built up well making decisions in the game harder.  This is one of the best RPG's I have ever played and I am yet to dive into any of the DLC's that the game offers.  A true 10/10 game. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/shahruk96/recommended/578080,1, Even after all the backlash that this game has gotten and rightfully so, the bugs, desync and hackers in the game can turn anybody off the game, however there is something about this game that keeps getting me back, the core mechanics of the game is what makes it one of the best battle royals on the market right now. Having played the main battle royals (Fortnite, Blackout) and other indie BR games I can safely say that this is the best, due to many reasons, the gunplay - the gunplay is one the best, if not the best of all battle royals, and in general, the satisfaction of killing someone from 400 meters out with a kar98k or gunning down a squad with your ump will never get old. Secondly the maps, sanhok is where you will find the most fun and quick action with erangel being a close second, I am not a fan of mirmar however there are others who enjoy the slow pace of the map. I thoroughly enjoy each of the map¡¯s aesthetics with their own iconic landmarks and their own guns and vehicles, so this is why I believe this gives a heads up to PUBG especially when other games only give you one map, the more the better right? Finally why I believe this is the best battle royale shooter is due to the skill gap, you will not become shroud overnight, heck you would not become shroud with over 1000 hours of gameplay, the learning curve in this game is great, the satisfaction you get when you finally aim right and hit the guy in the head after all the misses in previous games will never be topped. So in conclusion, I will not recommend this game currently if you are planning to buy just because even after a whole year of going out of beta, there are still major problems with the game, which I have previously stated and which should have been fixed by now, the smoothness and support of the other major BR's just blow this out the water and I would recommend blackout and fortnite before this, they both have their ups and downs however from a personal standpoint; this game has given me a great time especially with friends, (and has given me money too!) and I cannot say I feel the same way about other games in the battle royale genre. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/shahruk96/recommended/203160,1, Great storyline Great Graphics A hot british girl  What more do you want?  10/10 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/coloric/recommended/930460,1, Bom jogo, com gr¨¢fico interessante e ¨¢udio e narrativas muito divertidas. Os controles precisam melhorar um pouco. Nossa bandeira jamais ser¨¢ vermelha! Comunistas n?o passar?o! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ziem/recommended/70,1, HEY!  WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!  READING REVIEWS?!  DISREGARD ALL REVIEWS!  THIS IS HALF-LIFE!  THIS IS THE REASON THAT STEAM EXISTS IN THE FIRST PLACE! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ziem/recommended/40800,1, Contestant for most difficult game ever. Especially some achievements..  Great mechanics and music, though. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ziem/recommended/321260,-1, Well, the situation is quite simple...  Arena shooter with a twist - you don't pick up weapons, you pick up &quot;beasts&quot;. Each beast has different attacks, just like primary and secondary fire in &quot;normal&quot; first person shooters. The beasts are the different weapons, basically.  Every beast has its own health. If the health gets to zero, the beast is &quot;defeated&quot; and disappears (or dies, not sure, you see a strange reddish fountain, I don't know what to make of it.. ).  If you lose a beast, you'll be instantly switched to another beast you have picked up before. If all beasts are gone, only the mere mortal remains. That is what you spawn as, a simple human. But you have a crossbow (fully automatic). At least something.  The thing is, you don't just have to watch the health of your beasts, no, your mortal form takes damage too. And if your human health reaches zero you are dead, no matter how many beasts you picked up before..   Interesting concept for a multiplayer shooter, I have to say. Innovation is still possible in that genre, it seems.  Here is the thing: I have found no other games, no other players, nothing, zero, nada..  This kinda defeats the whole point of a multiplayer game, I would say...  Until this situation changes: Not recommended.   
https://steamcommunity.com/id/coloric/recommended/531960,1, Great free game, but the last achievement is so hard lol 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ziem/recommended/222880,1, &quot;This game needs to be more like CoD!&quot;  My favorite Insurgency joke ;)    This is a very promising project, it already works fine despite being in Early Access, Insurgency really delivers some intense first person combat action. Strategy and teamwork are absolutely essential if you actually want to win a single round in this game. A nice example that communication really is key. The integrated voice system influences the gameplay and is a great idea that we hopefully see more often in the future.  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/coloric/recommended/562220,1, Really cool game! Simple, but fun! ^^ 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ziem/recommended/578080,1, The reports of PUBG's forthcoming death have been greatly exaggerated... 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/coloric/recommended/421670,1, Great game, with cool graphics and music, and a lot of achievements. Approved! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ziem/recommended/374570,1, Wow.  This is just so over the top...  Old school retro action flick, but it is really GREAT.  I'm totally serious.  Go watch it.  Excellently done. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/coloric/recommended/578080,1, Great game, good to play with friends and to make more friends. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/coloric/recommended/485890,-1, 2 GB available space for this crap game. Just played for the achievements. Fortunately, uninstall function works fine. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/coloric/recommended/437160,1, Great game! Good story, graphics and music! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/coloric/recommended/730,1, Best FPS ever! Best selling PC game in the world! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/1eZediiiik/recommended/578080,1, Good gameplay  but bad server always  lost connection. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ziem/recommended/317510,-1, What is  Beyond Gravity ?  You play some sort of astronaut jumping from planet to planet, trying to collect the items floating between them. That sums up the whole game, basically.  You may have already noticed that  Beyond Gravity  is a 2D game, so the &quot;planets&quot; are more or less just rotating disks. The &quot;planets&quot; vary in size and angular velocity. The description of the game mentions it is &quot;procedurally generated&quot;, I guess that is what they meant.  As you progress through the game, the &quot;planets&quot; get smaller, they rotate faster and the distance between them increases. To deal with the growing difficulty, you can spend the picked up items to buy some upgrades. Now you can do multiple jumps in the air (space?), jump faster, pick up items at a greater distance, but nothing that changes the fundamental mechanics of the game. Additionally, the price for the upgrades is quite high, so you need to play again and again until you can afford to buy some upgrades, resulting in a gameplay that feels repetitive really quick (read: grindfest).   Again, what is  Beyond Gravity ?  Long story short: it is a simple flash game.  The kind of game you can play on the web. I have no idea what the first flash games were, but they have been around for 15 years, easily. The more sophisticated ones, at least. So, the thing is, there are dozens of flash games out there that are better than  Beyond Gravity . And they are free.  On the plus side,  Beyond Gravity  has nice animations, and the visual style is pretty cute. And it has one distinct advantage over flash games on the web: achievements.    My rating:   For the genre (flash games): 58 / 100  For the grand scheme of gaming things: 5 / 100    My library categories:   Flash, Trash 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/coloric/recommended/434260,1, Nice game and a lot of achievements. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/coloric/recommended/352610,1, Great game! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ziem/recommended/732430,1, Simple, but fun.. Game mechanics make this possible.  Very relaxing experience, recommended for everyone in search for their gaming moments of zen.  For those aiming for high scores: I disapprove of the risk/reward balance, though. ;-)   
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ziem/recommended/242680,1, Playing this game, like..  YOU DID NOT REACH THE NUCLEAR THRONE!!   Oh, okay then.  8/10 would not reach the nuclear throne again. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ziem/recommended/219150,1, That's what happens when you do prank calls, kids!  Great game, highly recommended! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/nursesdoitwithlove/recommended/292030,1, Loooooooooove ??  This game is aging like a fine wine. The 2nd playthrough is even better!  It brings so many relaxing moments after a stressful day. And the Blood and Wine DLC is literally like a whole new game!  The Witcher 3 is truly a Masterpiece!!! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/nursesdoitwithlove/recommended/440,1, Endless ??:) 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/nursesdoitwithlove/recommended/578080,1, PUBG a love/hate relationship ?  I really like this game and can't stop playing it. Ya, it has issues, it can be frustrating sometimes.. but I¡¯ve also played over 800 hours.  The reason is, despite it having problems, it¡¯s still fun.  Especially with friends! :) 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198283813918/recommended/570,1, just play with friends :) 
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198283813918/recommended/730,1, very fun 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/q_ball/recommended/578080,1, So... Pubg... I see alot of negative reviews that are quite frankly somewhat fair and unfair to the product.   I can say having paid for a few keys and the pre-release game that for the $30-$50 that this game has cost me, I have gotten my moneys worth.  Over a year of solid online play has been had with friends in squads and thats definitely a??????ton of time.    The issues suggested by others are many: 1) Region blocking due to cheats 2) Cheat protection was poor 3) Network Latency/deseync is high and still a problem 4) New content has been very slow to release, maps, guns, etc 5) Poor release schedule on updates, almost always ran long 6) Game seems to have become a skin-engine (like Counter Strike) 7) Map glitches causing damage/movement issues  Some of those issues are with the company and some with the gamer design. Here's the fundamental goods about the game. 1) Methodical paced games. 2) Solid gun play feel and weight 3) Great positional audio/sound work  4) Enjoyable coop feel for a small team 6) 3 large/well placed maps. 7) Decent transport system  Overall I'd say this game when played with a good group of well intentioned fun seekers is still  a fun game.  Part of the original fun was in the jank from the game and as BlueHole has tried to push this game into a more polished and e-sports-capable state, it has suffered some with the crowd due to the ridiculous nature of deaths and general fun/sillyness dropping away.   At this point the game has large flaws, map issues with odd placement of momentum stopping dips, vehicle oddness in movement code, general desync between players engagements, and some basic problems with region protection and cheater prevention.    It is still however fun with a good group of people.  Is it worth the price now?  I don't know, but I will say that it was for me and I've enjoyed my time with this game.   Will I continue to play?  Probably because its still relatively enjoyable with the right friends.   However I will likely move on eventually to another more polished game due to the slow release and often poorly defined release cycle of the developers game updates.  I think it is getting better, but I'm not sure if the future holds any meaningful updates for this game.     
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198283813918/recommended/578080,1, very fun to play with friends :) 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/NotJacko32931/recommended/6860,1, One of the best bald heads I have seen since mussolini

https://steamcommunity.com/id/NotJacko32931/recommended/251950,1, Really great game that i reccomend for people complaining about the price of premium its not that expensive and very good for its age 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/shahruk96/recommended/220240,1, One of the best games I have ever played. Nothing more to say. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/NotJacko32931/recommended/578080,1, Ok 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/NotJacko32931/recommended/489940,-1, this game has been fludded with the csgo toxic community and kids who dont know a thing about ww2 im very dissapointed for what i got waiting almost a year for this game to come out i was not expecting this game to be like csgo but more like a call of duty or battlefield game their is unbalanced teams and unbalanced weapons i dont reccomend this game at the moment until updates. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/NotJacko32931/recommended/734580,1, its fun but needs alot more things fixed and more options 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/mojo12yo/recommended/915460,1,  Cannot Go Wrong For 2 Bucks!!!  Ultimate Hardbass Defence...Ahhh... Summed up this game is worth every penny. Dance-happy characters looking to kill some zombies. Co-op adds for a fun twist. A simple game with some defects but all around a great purchase! This game will have you dancing out of your chair. Not to mention the music. The music is what drew me in, right off the bat, you take off on some heavy Techno.  Verdict: 8/10 for a $1.99 game 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/mojo12yo/recommended/218620,1,   A Co-op Experience Every Gamer Should Have  Payday 2 boasts an amazing Co-op experience. Among the top I've experienced. Plenty of guns, upgrades and MASK'S. Paydays signature, The Masks worn by the intelligent, stealthy robbers, Is what added the first &quot;hmm that's interesting&quot; kick. Robbing everything from banks, cars, Tony Montana mansion and more, this game has content for a good amount of replay ability.  Downside, their were and still are bugs, lag and server issues (my experience). The game plays great and is addicting, but I can't help but feel like somethings mission, more could of been brought to the table. In all this is one of my top favorite titles. It was one of those games that grabs you and brings you in.   Verdict:  8.5/10 16hr power sessions 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/mojo12yo/recommended/460930,1, Highly recommend this game to any open worl shooter enthusiasts. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/mojo12yo/recommended/232090,1, Fast paced Co-op action at its finest!  All around great game. A mixture of L4D2 and DOOM, Throw in 5 other Co-op players, a leveling system, classes and skins and you've got Killing Floor 2. This game will have you coming back for more every time. If your a Co-op enthusiast, Killing Floor 2 is a must play.  Graphics are great. Cities, Dungeons, Labs, Beaches and more. Beautiful in the beginning and covered in blood and gore by the end. Beautifully executed!  Gameplay is among a fast paced genre of FPS. Dont slip up, If you do you're sure to be taken out by the &quot;Zeds&quot; quickly. If you like games such as Doom or Call Of Duty for the fast paced action, Killing Floor 2 will not disappoint!  Verdict: 8.5/10 &quot;Its Already Monday?&quot; 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/mojo12yo/recommended/369200,1, Great game for a true FPS lover!  PROS: -Great class system with custom skills -Unique and spot on graphics -Combat Arms players will feel at home -Easy to learn controls and navagateable UI -Will have you coming back for more -Fans of the show and movies will appreciate -Guns are very customizable CONS: -Only 4 levels at the moment -Occasional lag spikes and disconection -Aiming system is hard to get use to (at least for me) -Still in early access  / Not many lobbies -Limited customization (as of now we will see what the future holds)  VERDICT: -8.5- An all around, well put together and executed game. Fans of the show will feel right at home, as will newcomers, to the GITS family. A challenging yet rewarding F2P game with a lot of room for expantion! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/mojo12yo/recommended/598470,-1, Not Recommended if your looking for an actual dungeon crawler. If your an achievement seeker and want the trading cards. This game is for you.  Dungeon Creepster boasts 500 easy achievements. All you have to do is kill 500 enemies and boom, you've just %100 the game. Other than that the enjoyability is roughly mediocre. But hey, how about those trading cards that 100 and the 500 achievements!!  Verdict: 4/10 Mehh 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/mojo12yo/recommended/295110,-1, R.I.P. H1Z1 Just Survive From my favorite game to a completely different game...  PV You will be missed as I viewed you from atop the church and awaited eager spawners with my .308 :P... Cramberry what a great place to meet up with friends and head out eagerly to DeSotos for a raid... Zimm's my first base building grounds and a great area to stake out players for loot... ARNF!  New H1Z1-Nuff Said, Completely different game...No Thank You!!! 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/mojo12yo/recommended/541300,-1, Ahh Survive The Nights...Early Access 2.2 Review      Survive The Nights is an Open World, Sandbox, Zombie Survival in its beggining statges of Early Access. Although it did hold my attention and has a lot of room for advancement, the cons are just to overbearing to want to play the game right now. At 24.99USD there are plenty of other titles out there that perform better and hold your attention for much longer than STN.  Pros: -Great atmospheric enviornment -Optimal future content to look forward to -Developers are hands on with fixing bugs and problems -Graphics are decently presented 7/10  Cons: -Low inventory carrying capability -Crafting system is missing alot and is very buggy at times -Random game crashes -Looting, Feeding, Drinking, Maintaining health and warmth feel like a chore    -Looting is practically not there (Check 20 cabinets, Find one Dirty Water) -Loot Storage is unavailable or will dissapear out of dressors you stored your loot in -Zombies walk through doors and dont even notice you from time to time -Features such as some weapons, tools, generators not implemented or bugged     In my opinion this game has a lot of potential and could be one of the better sandbox survival games out there when a lot of these issues are addressed and fixed. Until then, I wouldnt shell out the 25 bucks just yet.  
https://steamcommunity.com/id/cockieschan/recommended/252950,1, Really fun game to play with friends 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/cockieschan/recommended/440,-1, THis game was fun, until people started trying hard in casuals.  Where are my good ol' days in hightower where everyone used the rocket jumped trying to shovel everyone, smh.  Game went on a ?????? path. 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/mojo12yo/recommended/578080,1, Adrenaline filled, Action packed Masterpiece.  At release, I had overlooked this game heavily. All the reviews pointed me out of the direction of this game, as do most with early access titles. But PUBG was different...  After a few cocktails, I said screw it and picked up the title. BOYY! The heart renching adrenaline that I got while playing is what kept me addicted. Even with the heavy stress for mediocre graphics and the Pixelated late loading houses, I couldn't get enough! People is really what makes this game fun. Sure the map may be the same, but every game is different and depending on where you jump, options are endless.  Graphically, the game is decent. Well rounded and doesnt shy away from details. Although The memory tole that the game takes will have you wanting to get another 8 gigs of ram if your sitting on 8 already or god forbid 4. As with most games, loading time can be a pain if your running off of a HDD, but this can be heavily reduced by purchasing a SSD.  Bugs are not as big an issue as they were previously and the developers fix issues regularly. (With a flagship like PUBG why wouldn't you) Gameplay can feel choppy to anyone with a mediocre to sub-par PC, if trying to play on Med-High to Max settings.   Verdict: 7.5/10 &quot;Just One More Game&quot; 
https://steamcommunity.com/id/mojo12yo/recommended/717690,-1, WOW! Talk about a challenge...  For all you Payday Lovers out there, dont get your hopes up to much. Stick with payday if you like the gunplay. Summary of Overkill's:TWD Is a melee based, Team tactical game(Multiplayer ONLY). Penalizations of too much gun use in a form of 3 levels. Once full, it is nearly impossible to get around or past zombies to get objectives done. Add some unfriendly AI with guns and its a party.  GAMEPLAY: Fun fast pased but gets old way to quick. Mechanics and hitboxes could use a lot of work and tweaking. Sumarized, for me, was finding the best object to hop on and use the same &quot;haymaker&quot; melee swing on 20-40 zombies until the path was clear. Then it was on to the next spot, to find the next object to stand on while players shoot shoot shoot, run out of ammo and attract zombies in hoardes. 6/10  GRAPHICS: Decent graphics and zombies are well put together. It is a pretty game, although not 60 dollars pretty. 7/10  LOOT: Loot is, well everywhere. With on the spot crafting, your looking for whatever you can find. Although the game sometimes does not let you pick up items because your full (The conclusion i came to) of the items already. A lot of loot requires items to be used in order to obtain it, and every character has a special way of doing so. Another aspect of the Teamwork. 7/10  SKILL TREE/GUN UPGRADES: Very simplex compared to how PD2 was setup. Ive played a total of 10 matches and have only gotten 2 new guns, a couple of attachments and tools to keep my camp up. guns deteriorate after won matches and, I believe, they have to be repaired. Skills are simple reload increase, med kit drop increase, melee increase, health increase for each character this may vary but in my case there were 3 tiers of skills and 2 sections with about 25-30 all together. Mix and match to make your character withstand the hordes. 7/10  CONCLUSION: I have high hopes for this game, but it needs a lot of tuning and work. Simple things such as getting glitched in walls, lag spikes when players enter, allowing you to get overtaken by zombies, Hit box and zombie grabs are few and far inbetween from being correct, SINGLE PLAYER (This is a big one for me) IS NOT AN OPTION, and many more problems that should be addressed before this game is worthy of a $60.00 price tag. This is to be expected from a new release game, with hotfixes and updates hopefully to come soon. At the time I cannot recommend this game, but hopefully in the future it gets better.
