12621,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ivanleterrible/recommended/401680,ivanleterrible,401680,Postal was a cult and controversial game released in the 90ies . The controversy spins around the fact that in the game you play the role of a mad man , known only as ¡°postal dude ¡±, who basically goes into a rampage , killing everyone around him based only on his own delirious ideas of ¡°purifying the Earth ¡± or something . Another controversy is that the game hints a few references to some macabre school shootings that happend by the time of the game 's release in the 90ies . Gameplay The game is an isometric shooter , where you move your character around the evironment while trying to aim and shoot everyone on sight . Scattered around the corners you will find new weapons , ammo and a few power ups that will help you in your journey of insane murder . You will be running around towns , parks and a other populated areas , all filled with random ¡°innocent¡± people and also hostile ones , like cops , rangers , soldiers and other agents of the law trying to stop you . Kill 90% of the hostiles and you can move to the next level . Redux version This version has a LOT of improvements to add , starting with the controls , which are much , much better now . The combination mouse +keyboard has now a very fluid gameplay , with resposive controls , unlike the 90ies version , where controls were clunky AF . Also , all the DLCs were added and a few more singleplayer modes were add too , making the game much larger and potentially replayable . There are also a few easter eggs , like some references and modes related to other games , such as Hatred and Such . I Rate it 4.8/5.0
12622,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sen-frost/recommended/431270,sen-frost,431270,Do not buy this {?} it 's not even a true game . The dev just want to make money with trading cards , and have people buying it for the achievements . Furthermore , it 's an illegal bundle and Valva will probably do something soon .

12630,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zxc23/recommended/794940,zxc23,794940,This is a fun puzzle game . I found the description confusing but tried it anyway , and it was a good thing I did . The idea is that there are triangles that you must prevent from reaching the target squares . You can block one hex cell per turn , while the triangle will try alternative routes to reach the target until you completely wall off the triangles from all target squares . New elements are gradually added , including special abilities that you have limited uses of , such as the ability to block a hex cell without advancing the turn , and the ability to lay a distraction for the triangles . The game became a lot more fun and made more sense when I found out that the abilities on the left side of your screen are meant to be helpers and aren 't supposed to be used to 'fully complete ' each level . Instead , try to complete each level using only the abilities on the right side unless you get stuck . I don 't care a great deal about achievements but for a short puzzle game with no randomly generated puzzles with which to keep completing after the main game , I was surprised that there was an achievement that required some grinding to complete (reaching 1000 hexagons turned ). I 'd recommend the developer to make that 500 required so that people are more likely to have completed it before the entire game .

During the time I spent on the game and looking through the official discord , I had been welcomed , not only by the staff but by other users , the community during the beta was active it took less than a minute to find users on the AUS servers , The overall mechanics of the game are outstanding for such a game , the games are always fast paced , and to my knowledge very soon duos are being released which will be fun for you and a mate ! Mechanics - 9/10 Community - 10/10 Gameplay - 9.5/10 Overall Rating : 9.5 Comments : I feel like having a tutorial in the game would be pretty helpful , during the 1st game I was in I had found it just a tad bit confusing , apart from that this game is doing a great job and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who happens to enjoy any survival games ! Hope to see you all in the game !
12633,https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_ulf/recommended/264710,the_ulf,264710,Already shows incredible promise and great potential to be one of the few absolute standout success in the quickly overcrowding genre of survival games . Great structure in place for progression , an amazing sense of exploration and awe , and downright gorgeous to boot . The game 's ongoing development is very open (almost excessively - if you 're curious about game dsign and development or want to contribute feedback it 's awesome but if you don 't want any of the discovery and learning curve of the game spoiled for you you 'll want to avoid some of it ). More importantly , it 's in good hands - the Unknown Worlds team isn 't new to early access style development and isn 't about to give up or dissapear . If early access isn 't your thing , keep an eye on this title and await it 's offical 1.0 release . It 's already extremely fun !

And I 've played Campaign Clicker . No achievements to hunt for , limited number of beers , leveling up the bartender is irrelevent since this really is an idle game , not a clicker one . No variety in bartenders (there is just one ), one looping music track that you will turn off after the third loop . There just isn 't really a game here . This should be a free game . It 's a high school coding project not something that should be for sale on Steam .
12637,https://steamcommunity.com/id/z138/recommended/211400,z138,211400,Hot garbage . This game 's clunky , unresponsive controls are what define it . The poor story and worse voice acting are overshadowed by the ever-present fact that you 're going to constantly die because of the game 's terrible controls . Even the visuals that other reviews seem to be praising are console-grade mediocrity . The PC version doesn 't even have graphics options . Only a single sliding quality scale . Save yourself a headache and pass on this one .

For those who haven 't played Gone Home : This game have very little " game " aspects . It exists in a 3D enviroment and you interact with objects to progress the story , but it isn 't difficult . And I mean difficult as in a failure state , you just simply play the game and enjoy it , which is a good and a bad thing depending on what you want out of a game . It took me 4 hours to be so hopefully that helps you decide if it is worth $20 or to wait for a sale .

12647,https://steamcommunity.com/id/artemer/recommended/262060,artemer,262060,I understand why people could find this game frustrating , as it might seem unfair at times . What I don 't understand is why anybody would downvote it for that . Keyboard-breaking difficulty aside , Darkest Dungeon is , without any doubt , a masterpiece . The gameplay is solid , the art is insanely stylish , and the satisfaction after each victory is immense . Oh , and the Narrator 's awesome voice will stick in your head for a month . And it 's not even that hard if you are patient . Always prepare well and do not take unnecessary risks . Never , ever send your strongest heroes to missions if they have insufficient equipment or unfavorable quirks , unless you have means to mitigate them . If you are not prepared enough , just spend one more in-game week and prepare better . I aimed to Batman-level preparedness all the time and managed to finish the game without a single wipe and with just 15 heroes dead . It could have been 12 , if I had not lowevered my guard that one time by thinking that my fresh level 5 cubs could take on that Vvulf bastard . And please consider the following : you don 't have to finish the game to enjoy it . It 's still worth its price . I urge you to go for it . The battle may yet be won .

The game has received a serious overhaul since it first became available in Early Access , and playing it now is a joy as you explore a universe that 's easy to get lost in , all while upgrading your ship and equipment , recruiting a crew , and if you want , colonizing worlds or building whatever you want sandbox-style .

Can 't you give at least a LITTLE more information toward understanding your story at all {?} All this game feels like it is patronizing the player . " Oh ! You didn 't see that branch there ? Trip and die !" " Oh ? You didn 't notice I took away the railing ? Splat !" " Oh ! You didn 't notice there 's a door to close ? Get wrecked , nerd !" " Oh ! You didn 't realize you had to open AND THEN close to gate ? Get drowned !" " Oh ! You didn 't know the dogs would knock you off the fence ? Get eaten alive !" And on , and on . The game feels malicious in its set up . Not the world , not the enemies , the GAME itself to the player . It 's the worst kind of trial and error and it left me feeling more frustrated than interested in the game or world . See above again .

It could use more documentation , especially regarding the warehouse and how it works . I 'll be damned if I can get it to accept my cotton transports .

If you are not interested in installing mods and changing settings in root folders then I 'd look elsewhere at the moment . If you don 't mind then this game is absolutley incredible . I was scared to get into it when I started because I could sense how deep this game was . I have experience with Fallout and Fallout 2 but none of the 1st person Fallouts . I 'm 18 hours into it and my least favorite part of the game has become my favorite . I was not keen to the idea of colony building when I started but now I 'm building a CHA colony fiend and I love it . I have played through one whole controller charge and then some more today . I 'm stopping due to exhaustion . Yes it 's not perfect , but there is no game that offers this much depth with quality . Being able to mod it is a HUGE plus .

Even more so if you have a bunch of friends to play with locally . Occasionally all my flatmates squeeze infront of my PC and we play for just half an hour (to be honest it usually extends to 90 minutes before anybody gets back to learning ). Pros : - local / online multiplayer (no need to have 4 PCs running just because one person isn 't around ) - community involvement (I think so ) - easy to learn with complexity to master (dodging grapples , setting up grapple traps ) - leveleditor - fun is primary goal - best racing game on the PC that compares to the good old N64 Mario Kart Cons : - I 'll have to think of some .. it doesn 't support webcams to record your friends face just when you grappled them to their death

This game is very wonderful in many ways , and certainly with your time if you want to try it out . Up to 4 people can win a match . Adventure Pass system is incredibly rewarding for both free and paid versions . 3 different " classes " allow for slightly different playstyles each time , however aren 't crucial to know your way around to be good . overall aesthetics are very nice . game feels very optimised compared to other BR titles I 've played .

The positive reviews as well as the affordable price on sale ($0.70 for me ) plus the very achievable achievements (though some I wasn 't sure what was required so I Googled ) drew me in . I also appreciate that the developers are on the ball and they get back pretty quickly to queries on the forums as well as working on bugs . It seems that over time they 've added more achievements and levels (for free , not as DLCs ) and I like to support such developers to encourage them to produce more good games and to keep the gamers in mind ! =)

I shouldn 't be playing a game with no plot this much and even though most of the game is played " idling " (you can let it run in the background ), it will still take you a fair bit of time managing some of the stuff though a recent update involving autoclickers means its possible for long time players to have some form of automation to decrease this amount of time . Having played this since more than a year ago , I can see the many changes that the developers have made over the years based on the feedback given on Reddit and kudos to them for being close to community and really listening to what the players have to say . I 've not paid a single cent though I do think they deserve it so here I am to at least give them encouragement that they are on the right track and I wish them all the best with Clicker Heroes 2 that 's supposedly due fairly soon (in a month or so I think )!

It 's the perfect example of a game that 's easy to pick up and learn (drag a line , cut stuff ), yet hard to master (some cutting puzzles are MUCH harder than others , and the difficulty ramps up a bit too quickly ). And best yet , you aren 't penalized for making mistakes , as the handy reset button will quickly undo your mistakes , one at a time Pick it up when you need a relaxing brain workout . ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pros : + Easy to learn , hard to master + Excellent sound design and music + Easy to go back and fix mistakes + Easy to skip difficult levels Cons : - Difficulty rises too quickly , especially for perfect runs . - No real progression - Controls can be a bit imperfect at times

I was a fan of the original natural selection and to see natural selection 2 being made and to see what it is today is really worthy of being a true pc gamer . Great price as well (25$ for digital deluxe editon ). If you didnt preorder , well thats too bad . :D I personally rate this game at 8/10.

12686,https://steamcommunity.com/id/slayerfroggie/recommended/225080,slayerfroggie,225080,Brothers is a game where you play 2 brothers who have set out on a journey to find a magical tree to cure their father who has become ill . Brothers has a very unique control scheme where you use a gamepad controller 's 2 analog sticks to control each brother indivdually and each the 2 triggers for them to interact , jump , etc . It is a a little difficult to pick up at first with you losing hand eye co-ordination at some moments , but nevertheless it is interesting and gives the game it 's own standout feature . With the game 's story I see others applauding how touching and sad it is . i can agree to some extent , but i could not find myself drawn to these charcters or their predictiment , i think i only played to get to the end late in the game because it was so mediocre . I know the ending wasn 't exactly cliche or anything , but I kept asking myself why the devs would make a plot decision such as that . What kept me interested through the most of the story however , was the unique fantasy world that had been created . the soundtrack for the game is quite spectacular and well done . besides the story which disinterested me , overall this game is a good game to sit through and play for fun and achievement hunting . I would strongly recommend playing with 2 people on the one controller for some extra fun . Overall I give Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons a 6.5/10

12704,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wildgoosespeeder/recommended/499520,wildgoosespeeder,499520,The puzzles and atmosphere are amazing . It 's a philosophy game , just like The Talos Principle . However , as the story progressed very early on , I had a gut feeling who the antagonist was going to be , and I was right . This could be because I have played many first person puzzler games before and just kind of know what to expect . However , the ending felt like a twist to me . I never expected T .O.M. to be in control of Ava Turing (protagonist and player character ) the entire time , and it creeped me out pretty good . Because of that , I can see why the game is called The Turing Test . It 's a real world concept , adapted around to be a game . I got some decent exposure to the concept . Now I am interested outside the game . This game marks a turning point for me . I am doing away with compromising graphic fidelity for an increased framerate . This game is amazing and worth the wait for me getting a new graphics card to be able to play this without compromising anything . I would highly recommend the game if you are ready for games requiring high graphical horsepower . The graphics card I selected was entry level ; the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050. This will hold me over and for future games I was looking to play in my wishlist , but never was confident enough my old configuration could handle it .

There are no NPC or mobs , no food , and only recently did the game get updated with oxygen . There are some bugs , especially when trying to play on servers but it is still a very good game .

The game is crashing so often and if you are unlucky you will lose game progress through this . Achievements are not unlocking at the right time in the game , presumably because of a broken stats counter . the developer didn 't even bother fixing the achievements . Instead of fixing his mistakes he added a function to unlock all the achievements in the main menu without any effort . I had to play the game from the beginning multiple times in order to earn achievements the game just skipped . pretty frustrating if you are an achievement hunter . To round things up , this game is just not finished . save yourself some money , not even worth ?0.79 Mister developer : fix your game !

It 's the most accessible , funnest MH game to play to date in my honest opinion , and improves on a lot of existing mechanics to make things more fun , and accessible to newer players . I played a handful of Gen myself on the 3DS with some friends , so I wouldn 't say I have a very extensive background on the series , but I can tell you that World is much friendlier to new players , and is so far providing me with some of my funnest Monster Hunter moments in the first few hours of play . I definitely recommend it if you have the cash and rig . There 's a handful of settings you can tinker , and if I can run it with a GTX 760 at a good 50-60 FPS , I ' sure you can find some way to make it work for your system . My internet is also pretty poor , topping at a 300kb / s download speed on average , and I 've run into 0 problems so far with connectivity with friends halfway across the world . It 's truly something amazing how well this works with my current setup .

Mining is great , fossils gathering is good (you can display your fossils also ), crafting is a real plus and of course there is money (pixels is the currency ), all this and much more in a simple (but effective ) 2D-pixel graphic environment .

It 's fairly easy but the game is not without it 's problems . In some aspects it 's similar to Kirby . It has a lovely atmosphere with great music . The artstyle and animation is simple and adorable . The story is straight forward and easy to follow . Gameplay is a mixture of platforming , puzzle solving , and basic action shooter . Controls are simple and easy to get to too . The hotkey for items feels like it could be improved a little . I 'd have liked mouse button support for this . Overall it feels pretty tight on controls . Combat is pretty easy . You don 't know how many hits an enemy needs to take to kill them . This can cause some close shaves . Being swarmed is the easiest way to die . Using healing items is risky as they have an activation time . If it 's not hotkey 'd then you aren 't pretty much done for in a fight . To open up your items menu you have to hit tab and then left click on the blue icon . This is simple enough but if it 's during a fight then expect to get hit a lot whilst doing this . Platforming can be frustrating at times . Some things look like platforms but sometimes they aren 't. There is no fall damage but that may mean back tracking . Other than that it 's fairly easy there is no feeling of slippery surfaces etc . Exploration of the world by running around or with side quests is rewarded with extra happiness , back story , weapon upgrades etc . I hope more people pick this up and enjoy this delightful little adventure .

Don 't get me wrong though , the devs did a really really good job . Graphics , sound , puzzles , all well done . The puzzles were quite creative , but not brain-destroying .

There are no crosshairs or minimaps . Everything has a decidedly old school approach . There aren 't any hand holding killcams . If you are sniped you aren 't going to know where the shooter is . If you shoot down an enemy player the game isn 't going to notify you . You 're going to have to investigate , or tell a team member to make sure the tango is down . After all they may have just gone prone after taking damage . There are no leveling classes to unlock guns or special perks for killing sprees .

12747,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RoadRedemption/recommended/359550,RoadRedemption,359550,I can 't recommend this game . Reasons : 1. The waiting time vs playing time is like 50% . In other words , you spend half as much time waiting for stuff to happen (matches to start , levels to load - even on a high spec machine ) as you do actually playing . This would be solved by allowing for more than 4 rounds in a match . Counterstrike matches end in 16 wins . Rainbow Six matches end in 3. Why {?} 2. You can 't form a multiplayer match with your Steam friends . Instead you can (theoretically) do this with your Uplay friends . Terrible . The game is on Steam . It should use Steam features . 3. I sent a Uplay friend request to a friend . He sent a request to me . Neither one of use received the Uplay friend request from the other , so we couldn 't ever even play together .

The process is cathartic in a solitaire type of way , but do this enough and maybe you 'll even start to figure out what 's going on . You do need to win a few times to unlock any new characters beyond the starting four , so it 'll be a while before you meet everyone in the game . The sound design is worth praising . The music is actually pretty good , the tiles make various satisfying clacks , and the voice acting isn 't too annoyingly prominent . There 's no story whatsoever , so if you 're looking for a visual novel , keep looking . The " translation " is an insult to the word , to be honest . The English that is there doesn 't appear to have come from someone fluent , if it came from a person at all . None of the girls ' quips are translated , but I can assure you that you aren 't missing much . The graphics are ... well , redundant to comment on . The static nature of the game makes those screenshots above pretty representative of the actual game . It does have the option to run at 1080p , that 's not always a given with these Japanese doujinsoft . The game is very responsive , there isn 't any downtime while playing it on the default (quick) setting . There are a few spots where the game expects you to click and drag (to scroll or look around ), which gives the impression it 's friendly to touch screens . So this game has a lot left to be desired , but it 's worth your attention if you are interested in 2D girls , Japanese , and ( inclusive and ) reach mahjong . I give it eight bucks out of fifteen .

Give your friends a " duffing " and steal their children . This is extremely fun for those with friends . If you are short in the friends department maybe look for something else .

It 's fine 95% of the time but the 5% can kill you because it 's a challenging game . - The game tells its story without any text which unfortunately includes all the UI elements and can cause some confusion . - Fairly short , so if you 're on a tight budget may want to wait for a sale down the line

Utterly random " puzzles " that require no logic , just lots of trial and error . The concept and the way the story is told warrants a a playthrough , but I 'd recommend having a walkthrough with you to navigate the more obscure and frankly tedious parts . The game 's biggest strength is the emotional resonance it achieves . Distraint is a morality tale told very well .

The Game wants you to pick up 10 blue balls which are placed all around a rather empty field inbetween rocks . Sadly there are barely ambient sounds , in a game which is called HEARING this is quite a let down , but it also helps to focus onto the objectiv . It can take a while till you get the balls together (dont worry , there are more then 10 so you can find this amount , else this would be tidious ). While you are at it you explore the gameworld which doesnt look too bad , skybox is .. well a box . It doesnt move . But the trees and grass react to wind and you run around and find lost buildings , campfires which were left alone and hidden characters . Of cource the main gimmick is still hearing , so what about it ? Well , to find the balls you need to listen to the sound of the game . These balls make a sound to find them in various places . Even tho the game promises that it could be played with your eyes closed .. you ?d rather not . As a fan of Dear Esther and various other genre-like games , its really hard to give this game a good or bad . I enjoyed the hunt , the idea and for a price of not even 1 Dollar - why not . But also there a numerous bugs , it can take quite a while to get the balls and without a proper ambient sound it seems empty ... I give this game the benefit of a doubt and give it a Thumbs up , but be warned that It might not be the game you are looking for . To see some small screenshots , check out mine =)

This game is a frustrating piece of {?} Total opposite of a zen game , and thus a total failure . And when you want to quit the game and press the only thing that looks like quit button , it erases your profile instead without asking " Are you sure you want to erase it ?" or something like that . Great interface ! Not ! The XBOX controller was hard to activate , you had to click on a little finger symbol in top right in start screen to activate it , not very logical .

12781,https://steamcommunity.com/id/titoshivan/recommended/286340,titoshivan,286340,I don 't know exactly why , but i love this little survival game . It doesn 't feature a lot of content and is rough around the edges , but it made me clock way more hours than i thought i would . The Story mode (Your submarine broke , you 're stranded on the bottom on the sea surviving while you find the 9 scattered pieces of it ) gives for around 6 hours of play without rushing (once you know the rules you can rush it quite easy ) Once you finish it you unlock the 'Survivor Mode ' (AKA Hard Mode ) or you can play it on Sanbox mode . The survival aspect isn 't on the hard side either . Food is a bigger issue early game and the predator AI is quite simple and predictable once you get to know it . Then as usual you have the crafting part which works pretty much as every other game . There 's harder games out there if you 're looking for a challenging survival experience . Far Sky falls more on the easy side of the survival genre . The ambience is what got me most of the game . The visual style got me from the first moment and I loved diving deeper to more haunting scenery . It also quite translates the loneliness feeling of being underwater . On the bad side , I feel like this game would fully blossom with modding capacity and it could have been polished a bit more . But it 's still a gem in it 's actual (and definitive . The dev has stated a sequel might happen but development on this game is done ) state . So TL :DR a not fully polished gem that is worth more than meet the eye .

According to the plot , a powerful artifact was stolen , which for centuries was guarded by monks alive in the mountains . But the attacker didn 't know that this would cause the last guardian of the ancient artifact , whose only purpose is to return and protect him . The graphics are presented in a pixel-style , very reminiscent of other famous platformers like VVVVVV and Super Meat Boy . Gameplay is reminiscent of oldschool games . It is difficult but enthralling , and a lot of secrets make it all better to explore . From the part this is an action , because it will be possible to use several types of weapons .

Although the players perspective is top down , this game has a slighty creepy aspect (especially if you read the info logs around each level ). The things that make this game so good is that your character starts with pretty much nothing , and you have to scavenge and craft items as you try to reach the end of each level . Perhaps the most nerve wracking aspect of the game is the need to save supplies ; it is easy to run out of med packs or ammo , so you find yourself trying to figure out the most efficient way of taking out crowds of zombies , or kill an exceptionally hard boss . There is no boring junk collecting as there is in other survival games . Other games have similar graphics and mechanics , but this game executes its purpose borderline flawlessly . A warning however , this game is very hard to beat . Teleglitch is a one of a kind type of game !

I love the original Minecraft , I played it for more than 1 ,500 hours . What I love most there is the freedom of creativity , and for that , I was willing to accept the lack of refined graphics and roleplay in NPC dialogues . This so-called " Story Mode " keeps the blocky graphics (not in a game engine , that could have been spectacular - it is all drawn ), but it takes away your freedom of movement and interaction with the environment completely , you folllow strictly limited corridors and obediently press buttons that are prompted to you on the screen or execute very obvious point-and-click set-ups . Building tasks are just recorded sequences that you go through by repeatedly hammering the same button a few times . Occasional puzzles and crafting tasks are so simple that a six-year-old could solve them with ease . Story ? The dialogues are voice acted in decent quality . That said , they are slow , dumb and predictable , just like the story itself . Telltale is allegedly specialized on interactive movies like that , but they did not even get the technical basics right : The time to make your choice in a dialogue is limited , and the NPC keeps on talking while your time runs out , which means you have to listen to what he or she says , read what you could respond and think about which option would fit best with your character at the same time - really distracting ! From time to time , the last word of the player character gets cut off ; no idea wether this was bad audio editing or a performance issue . Anyway , neither the story itself nor the presentation made me happy . Is this supposed to be a cartoon for little children ? That would explain a lot , but it was not advertised as such . I will not get into that widely discussed issue with the final chapters of the story coming out as paid DLC - I could not even play beyond the second chapter (of eight in total ) anyway because it was so painfully boring . Verdict and recommendations 3.5/10 - not only is this not a good game , this is not a game at all . It is an overpriced and dull animated movie with Minecraft assets , constantly interrupted by short interactive sequences that are neither exciting nor fun . (For example , in more than one case you have to walk around 10 steps between two scripted scenes - this is not immersively interactive , this is just annoying .) If you want a real Minecraft story mode , get one of those adventures written by modders , who set some parts of the environment as indestructible , but otherwise tell a story while still letting you play an actual game . If you are interested in the story that is told here , save your money and watch a walkthrough or LP online , but even if you won 't: You do not miss out on much .

It 's amazing how the series developed for all this time . Each game in the series kept getting better and better . And this applies to every aspect of the games - the puzzles , the graphics , the sound design and dubbing cast and so on . The story in this one takes a really dark turn and it takes it graceully . The ghost stories are moving and much deeper than anything you 've seen in games made by Telltale per example . One thing 's for sure - I will miss Rosa and Joey very damn much .
12801,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jesusfetus/recommended/326840,jesusfetus,326840,I don 't think I 've ever experienced a game quite like Heart &Slash. A fusion of Devil May Cry-esque 3D action brawling and Binding of Isaac-style random generation , this is a game that wants nothing more than to give you a fun bolt-busting time . It had a brief run on Kickstarter , followed by almost two years in Early Access , but a month ago it finally declared itself finished , and after completing the game 100% , I can honestly say it 's like nothing I 've ever played before . The question , then , becomes this : is that good or bad ? Plot &Story The year is the future . A so-called " robolution " , led by a mad QA testing machine , has led to the destruction of all life on earth and a world populated entirely by robots of all shapes and sizes , all under one control . Our hero is Heart , a non-conforming machine who finds itself mysteriously reactivated and led by videos of its original creator to hunt down the QA . On the way , Heart discovers Slash , a similarly nonconformist robot with a history with the villainous Quality Assurer ; together , they may be the world 's last hope of ending the mechanical rule . Looking at the Kickstarter campaign , it 's clear that the game was originally set to be much larger in scope . Entire characters were left out of the finished product , and what was set up to be a complex meta-plot regarding the relationship between Heart and Slash was ultimately cut short into a linear path . I 'm not going to complain about this ; I don 't think anyone funded a roguelite spectacle fighter for the plot . But the way the game ultimately handles the story is , well ... disappointing . Character relationships are simplified , to the extent that it 's hard to tell what they even are . And at times , the story actually becomes intrusive to the game . Around the end of the story , you 're expected to make a sacrifice to help defeat QA . It 's nice . It 's touching . Once you 've reached that point in the story , you see that ending every game . You can 't just fight the final boss normally anymore , not without using another playable character . Game &Play Upon entering the game , you are thrown into a room with three items , one primary weapon and two of anything else , either weapons or armor . Since this is a roguelite , these upgrades are always randomly selected . You can hold up to three weapons , one primary and two secondary that you toggle with the shoulder bumpers . Melee weapons can be equipped to any slot , but projectile weapons can only be equipped to shoulder slots . Combat is of the sort seen in games like DMC and Bayonetta , with two attack buttons tied to weak and strong attacks , a lock-on function , and free space to just smack robots up however you please . There 's a weird simple element-based combat system , where some enemies are vulnerable or resistant to among three different elements ; in theory , this is an interesting hook , but in practice , will likely end up a pointless hassle as you whittle down a room full of enemies who have resistance to the one type of weapon the RNG gave you . By fighting enemies , you are awarded with experience , and with enough you earn upgrade points . These can be used to up the stats of your weapons and armor , and yourself as well . The upgrades for each item are given colorful comments instead of direct statements of what they improve . For instance , the morning-star weapon has three upgrades : " It hits hard ..." , which increases its damage , " has decent length ..." , which increases its range of attack , and " and can be made lighter !" , which increases its attack speed . It 's a twist that I enjoy greatly , even if some of the upgrade names are incredibly vague as to what they actually improve . Aside from all that , you can recycle equipment pieces for extra health in a pinch , giving you more health if it 's been upgraded , and increasing your max health if you recycle at full HP . All this leads to another contesting issue with the game : it gets so easy . As you progress through the game 's plot , Heart earns upgrades that increase its base stats far beyond what it started with . On your first playthrough , Heart has six hearts , one damage modifier and resistance to one element , and by the end of the story that 's grown to eight hearts , three damage modifiers and resistance to all three elements . Plus , whenever you die , you restart with all your unused upgrade points , so why not max out your points , kill yourself , and start off the next run with a full piggy bank ? It 's not like you 're in that much danger of losing - the game only has three levels and bosses ! And only the first level boss actually tests your combat skill , the rest are all games of dodge until they reveal their weaknesses ! Look &Feel Stylistically , Heart &Slash is the most beautiful game I have seen in years . The voxel-art style is crisp and colorful , giving everything a lovely cartoon aesthetic . One level taking place in the outdoors turned out to have a number of randomly selected skyboxes , varying between night and day , dusk and dawn and even a foggy / smoggy atmosphere . Enemies are clearly animated and stylized , and watching them move is a treat . Every different boss has a unique intro sequence and fight music , even for the variant bosses on the first two levels . And the music . Oh , the music . It 's peppy and upbeat , always keeping you pumped no matter what the situation . I honestly think this might have the best soundtrack of 2016. <url> <url> <url> Bugs &Glitches I 'll be brief : this game is the buggiest thing I have ever seen . In no way was this ever at a state fit to leave Early Access . The geometries of various objects are jagged enough that players can easily get caught on the corner of an edge , or the side of a building , or even in between two platforms . On two separate occasions , I almost fell through a set of stairs and out of the game 's map . The camera swings and zooms wildly , almost always far too close for efficiency . By using items that allow you to fly or climb up walls , it 's possible to sequence break through parts of the entirely vertical final level and trigger flags that lock you out of necessary rooms , essentially breaking the game . And that 's not even going into all the issues I 've experienced such as camera freezing , an HP-boosting item that lowers your max HP , and in one infamous memory an entire boss just disappearing . Thoughts &Grade I have never been more conflicted over recommending Heart &Slash than I have in all my life . By all meaningful standards , it 's a hopelessly broken game ; the story is rubbish , the idea is inherently flawed , and the engine has more bugs than a cheap motel . And yet , I just cannot stop playing . I can 't help it , the game just makes me feel good . Even when it 's glitchy , the combat still nails that feeling of power and impact that tingles my endorphins . I love the apple-crisp art style and the rocking tunes . I love that feeling of getting my hands on a weapon that I know will smash my enemies into paste , or discovering an entirely new weapon and seeing what it can do . I love hurling myself axe-first into a room full of robots , smashing them to bits one by one all to get that last upgrade point to make myself even stronger . One of the unlockable characters is a robot dog who holds weapons in his mouth , and you bet I love that . There 's so much feeling put into the game 's style that it becomes worth overlooking the problems just to take part in the experience . I just can 't avoid making the obvious pun - this game has heart . If you 're looking for a game that will challenge you with tight combat and enemies that test all your skills , this is not it . Go get Devil May Cry 4. But if you 're in the mood for a piece of dumb fun , something you can waste hours on getting bombarded with abstract beauty and wacky weapons , then this is the game for you . Heart &Slash is a 6/10 , but it is the best 6/10 I have ever played .

But I had fun playing this game . I even played it through two times , since none of the achievements registered on my first playthrough . One thing I did not like was the expansion . It is needed to complete the story of Gabriel turning into Dracula . It wasn 't the story per se , that I didn 't like , but the presentation . I would need to spoil too much to describe what I mean , but believe me when I say that the expansion felt rushed , like it was only created to fill the gap between part one and two . That said , I would definitely recommend this game to fans of the genre .

There 's clues to solve some of the puzzles , and a lot of the gameplay goes beyond just moving a character and clicking everything till you progress . You need to really pay attention to what 's going on in the enviornments to figure things out , or to at least bookmark an area of interest for later . The animation is very nicely done , this seriously feels more like a Saturday morning cartoon that you control , rather than a game . You play as Tsioque ( pronounced as : chalk : ) and she usually looks pretty ticked off . I love the style of her character . There 's a story happening , but you are focusing on just getting our character out of lockup , and things derail pretty quikly from there . Among some of the puzzles , I found a mini game of sorts involving sewing up a better pocket for items . Right so in this game , you have 2 actions - click things , and a pocket to use items . Sometimes a puzzle requires a certain item to advance , used at just the right time . There 's usually some sort of hint , or clue - but you gotta be looking for them . IN my time with the game so far , there was no : hint system : but the devs said it is a feature they were implementing , as it was some of the progression was difficult to figure out , so a hint system is greatly appreciated . It 's a very cute and charming game , with decent writing and animation that really steals the show . Worth it alone just to admire the painstakingly hand animated world the devs have crafted here . And this is coming from a person that isn 't all that keen on Point and Click games . However ; Tsioque won me over with it 's design . Absolutely recommended .

12824,https://steamcommunity.com/id/waywardwatergod/recommended/391540,waywardwatergod,391540,Story : 5/5 The story in Undertale is hailed for a reason . I was sucked into it immediately with the (tu)Toriel arc in the Ruins and that emotional ride holds onto you the whole way through , no matter what route you 're taking . The most notable gimick of Undertale being it 's morality system , and the fact that anything you do , good or evil , will never be forgotten , even through your second and third playthroughs . All of the choices you make , you 're forced to live with and that 's rather unique in my eyes . Sorry to those of you who thought you had to kill goat mom , but there 's always YouTube ! Gameplay & Controls : 5/5 The controls in the game are very simple , you have simple 8-way movement and select / cancel , Undertale could technically be run with a NES controller (well, Mettaton might get a little difficult for you without Z .) I would complain that you only move at a fixed pace the entire time but all in all the game itself isn 't very long for an RPG so it 's not necessary in my eyes , I felt rather at easy with it . That also adds to the retro charm the game has to it as inspirations such as Earthbound and Yume Nikki were the same way . Keeping the controls simple left more focus on the gameplay itself , and I like that . Speaking of the gameplay , the battle system is very creative , I don 't think I 've ever played an RPG that turned your defensive turn into a bullet hell gauntlet , that was one element that originally drew me into playing , and holy gasterblaster Batman , the game surely will push you if you 're taking one particular route . Music & Sound : 5/5 Typically if a game is selling it 's soundtrack seperate that 's a good indicator that it 's rather good on it 's own , (I did say TYPICALLY , I know there 's quite a lot of junk out there trying to market it 's music off as something you 'd want to enjoy when in reality you would prefer to smash your skull against a wall for the same effect .) I haven 't been able to make a trip to or from work recently without a play of Megalovania or Save The World to keep my spirits up , that says a lot about a person who 's got over 200gigs of similar musics stockpiled up . Looking further , Undertale 's OST has been given multiple awards and Top 10 placings , most recently in memory one from WatchMojo (for a personal favorite of mine .) The music in itself would be one reason you wouldn 't want to spoil the game if the story doesn 't interest you . Visuals : 4.5/5 This new retro wave has served many indie developers well the past 10 or so years and I am ecstatic about it- that modern mechanics and experience can lend itself to the 8 and 16-bit aesthetic to give some really impressive results . Originally the fact that overworld sprites were colored and in-battle sprites were monochrome was a little puzzling to me but it gives a couple encounters a little room to expand it 's impact . I can 't decide whether or not I felt that was a good thing- eventually I stopped thinking about it when I became immersed in my first playthrough but it was one thing that nagged at me in the back of my head so it 's worth noting . Overall : 5/5 Undertale has become one of my favorite games of all time and I will most definitely be coming back to play more of it in the future , there 's so much mystique in and out of the game 's story that the internet is salivating with creative user-generated artwork and fan theories proped up by one annoying little dog who managed to program the game by accident . To say it has colored my presence online and my search histories in font skeletons and determination is a bit of an understatement . I love the characters , I love the music , I love the story and I love how its sole programmer has been handling it all . This is one gaming experience you won 't want to miss out on . EDIT : Nominated this for the tearful award in the 2016 Steam Awards .

The slimes themselves are adorable and surprisingly full of personality , ranging from huggable to terrifying . At the same time , the lack of NPCs in the game adds a certain melancholy that 's only heightened by the letters from home that the protagonist recieves . Nothing cheers you up like kitty-slimes though . <3

" It 's still awesome " because it kept that same feeling from Life is Strange -- once again , you can feel the story , you care about the characters , you really want things to turn out well . Personally , I liked Chloe more than Max . And Rachel is hot , so ... you know ... that 's important . On the other hand , there 's no time-travelling-shenanigans in BtS (although this is slightly compensated by the new " verbal abuse " mechanic ). One thing that pis *ed me off is that , in the last chapter , characters suddenly start to talk like senile ret *rds on Valium as a mean to artificially extend the game 's duration . It 's infuriating . If I 'm not misremembering , they did that in Life is Strange too . Before the Storm 's ending is also pretty " meh " -- I was hoping for something a lot more intense / dramatic . And your choices don 't matter so much in the long term as they did in the first game either . Opinions will vary from person to person , of course , but for me BtS 's first 2 chapters were great , because I was really invested into both Chloe and Rachel . Now , about the story , most of us would probably agree it 's not great . If you didn 't play the first Life is Strange , skip this : Another thing that sucks is that BtS is totally sad because you know what ends up happening to Rachel ... If you didn 't play Before the Storm , skip this : ... and WTF happened to Frank ? Not just at the end -- which is a total [and stupid ] mistery -- but ... Jesus ! after all he did for Chloe , we never get to talk to him again ? WTF ? I hope she at least invited him to a threesome with Rachel at some point between BtS and LiS . On a final note , it 's interesting that , personally , I hate playing games with a female protagonist because , you know , I 'm a dude . But we 're also programmed to care about chicks more than anything else , so it turns out both LiS games are a lot more interesting thanks to this . If you see a guy , let 's say , getting run over by a truck , shot , or falling from the 16th floor 's window , you either laugh or don 't give a sh *t. If you see the same thing happening to a girl , it pisses you off and you wanna kill someone . So ... yeah , that makes these games better .

Not to mention that while the voice acting was okay , yes , the game itself and the characters were incredibly two dementional with no good qualities . The men all had flat , generic , boring and predictable personalities ; and the heroine was the same . Boiling the datable characters down gives you a character that seems generally normal at first , and then turns out to be some scary , edgy , abusive and horrible man that wants nothing but the heroine 's body or to have her all to himself away from anyone . Doing the same to the heroine , she 's just the generic anime girl that is there to be abused and eventually succumb to stockholm syndrome and " live happily ever after " with her abuser that has for some reason decided to actually love her and stop hurting her . I just ... Hm . I was expecting a lot more than the flat , predictable , and not very thought out world I was given through this game . :/

12847,https://steamcommunity.com/id/clef/recommended/271240,clef,271240,I was intimidated upon hearing about the premise of this game ... It sounds like one of those games that are only fun to people with very specialized knowledge and tastes . But actually the developers have succeeded in making a very approachable and fast game about economy , business and finance , with clear tutorials and interface , and with a focus on multiplayer but still having a fun singleplayer experience . Every building needs special materials and produces something else , but all materials can be bought or sold at the market , with dynamic prices based on supply and demand . Imagine if in warcraft 2 , you could sell your extra lumber to other players . There 's no military combat here , but economic attacks , defense and espionage are integral to the game . You may be interested in the premise or not , but don 't skip the game fearing that it will be too complicated . The mechanics are simple at the core , and may teach you an abstract thing or two about how business works in the real world .

12849,https://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/855940,chudah,855940,I 'm not too proud to give credit to a developer when it 's due , and I do feel that MagicHouse has really tried to improve upon their games , and it shows with Magical Fable . That 's not to say it 's a good game , but it 's clearly better than the previous entries in the developer 's library . And while I can 't say I enjoyed reading through it , for the first time ever I didn 't find myself thoroughly disgusted upon completion . So ¡­yay? Magical Fables is actually a collection of 4 short stories that features the protagonist screwing each guy . Of course , there 's a superficial plot that 's the back drop for each one , but let 's be honest here , the stories aren 't why people are buying these games . Anyhow ¡­it starts off with a short prologue that introduces each of the characters , then you 're given the option to choose which of the guys ' stories to start . From there , it 's about 15 minutes of reading before you get to the sex scene , then about another 15 minutes to finish the story (assuming you get the good ending ). <url> So all in all , the game is really short and doesn 't have much going for it outside of the H scenes , which are ...okay? I mean the translation has markedly improved , but it still isn 't great . Not to mention the censoring of certain innocuous words completely boggles my mind (why does ¡°touch¡± need to be censored , really ?). And if you 're in it for the lewd CGs (R18 patch installed ), I have to say , half of them are really nicely drawn while the other half noticeably drop off in quality . Despite all that , I do feel like MagicHouse tried to improve upon the issues from their previous games . There is an option to turn ¡°Dash¡± on during gameplay , which speeds up the sprite animations while skipping through dialogue , something I was personally quite grateful for . You 're also able to get to the CG gallery from the Story Select Screen instead of having to play through the entire game or load an End Game save for it . Oh , and again , the translation is actually ¡­not a complete dumpster fire . It still isn 't good , but overall it 's better , which may or may not be a good thing depending on how you view these games . <url> But the one thing I enjoyed the most was the Bonus Story that 's unlocked upon getting all 4 good and bad game endings . Everyone joins your ¡°party¡± and we get to play through a short 3 boss RPGMaker dungeon , which was actually pretty fun . I loved the humor and the bosses we face off against , and it really REALLY makes me long for a full-blown otome RPG like it ¡­ That said , I still don 't think I can recommend the game considering the lack of interesting story and characters and the translation still not being up to par for an English localization . BUT it may be worth checking out if you 're willing to trudge through 2-3 hours of boring reading to get to 15 minutes of a cute RPGMaker quest line . Now , if only MagicHouse continues on this trajectory , maybe ¡­JUST maybe we 'll get a decently enjoyable otome RPG / VN hybrid from them one day . Curated by : Bad Otome Games & Chudah 's Corner

The twists of the story will break your heart . Between orders and being human you will lose one part of your soul . Unless you lose it totally at the end , of course .

It scared the hell out of me because it was pretty intense trying to survive against the great white sharks and angry crabs which inhabited the ocean . Ever since those days I 've been unsettled by underwater gameplay . I find it difficult to play any kind of shark infested water scenario and usually end up asking whoever I 'm with to take over . I had the bright idea of picking this game up because I like base building and survival , I was really drawn to the aesthetic and I also thought it might cure me of my fear through exposure . It didn 't. In fact I find it very difficult to progress in this game since I 'm too scared to venture far from the shallows which is what you 'll need to do if you want to gain better technology and improve your chances . This is an amazingly intense gaming experience . Beautiful , immersive , and deeply atmospheric . It is however , absolutely terrifying , leaving you feeling vulnerable and helpless as you attempt to explore the unforgiving , alien ocean . Scores highly on jump factor . I think I would have several heart attacks if I ever played this in VR . Excellent visuals , eeire SFX and a nice soundtrack too . It can be a little glitchy at times but despite that I highly rate this game and would recommend it as single player (horror?) survival . It 's even reasonably child friendly as there is not really any violence involved (other than being torn apart by giant sea monsters ). Be warned : you might give your kids a phobia of open water , like I got from playing Ecco the Dolphin all those years ago .

I loved that and prepared for what I like the most in roguelikes : frustration , countless deaths and that awesome feeling of satisfaction the moment I beat the game . And after beating five or six levels the game tells me : " That 's all , you win ." I felt betrayed . While this game is a fun and addicting , it 's just too short for my tastes in roguelikes . I 'm aware , there 's Endless mode , but without a definite goal of beathing the game I just don 't feel motivated to make a run through it . This game does not deserve a negative review , I just would not recommend buying it for the full price . tl ;dr: too short for that price .

12869,https://steamcommunity.com/id/insanitysmuse/recommended/415920,insanitysmuse,415920,It 's hard to find a game that scratches the same itch that Final Fantasy Tactics gave me so long ago , but this comes pretty close . The game is definitely remiscent of it , with spending skill points to learn active and passive skills , having a primary & secondary class to mix and match your skills , desperately trying to manuever just right so your healer doesn 't get mauled down by that jerk void-monster-thing over there and the boss fights are all pretty fun . The music is surprisingly solid throughout and few tunes even stick in your head afterwards . The only real bug I encountered I made a post about and had a response within a day or two from the dev (even though it was a pretty minor bug in the sceme of things ). The game has an interesting inclusion of using shovels , picks , and other tools to interact with things on the map , sometimes obviously and sometimes secretly . The only real negative I have is that inventory management is kind of annoying , but I say that as someone who hates inventory management in literally every game that has it (Diablo, Fallout , etc .) so grain of salt there . If you are out for a tactical RPG , this is a great one to give a shot . It might not look flashy but there 's a lot of depth to uncover here .

12871,https://steamcommunity.com/id/95823985741098/recommended/365590,95823985741098,365590,Introduction : Tom Clancy 's The Division is an Third Person Open World Action Adventure MMO Set in Manhattan in the year 2030 after a deadly virus burned through the state of New York . The President Issued Directive 51 and Put the State into Martial Law . You are an Agent of the JTF and the Division fighting the result of the virus - Deadly Gangs , Escaped Prisoner 's, Contaminated Civilians and more . Review : Sometime in the 2030s an Unknown Strain of the Smallpox Virus Known as " Green Poison " or " Dollar Flu " Among other Nicknames , was developed by Dr . Gordon Amherst , a virologist , as a means of population control and was distributed by infected dollar bills during the Black Friday shopping insanity . The Dollar Flu became so Out of Control that the Government Placed New York , More Specifically Manhattan Under Quarantine and a Martial Law . The Government then began Activating Sleeper Agents Who work for The Division to help the JTF (Joint Task Force " Restore Order to the State and City . The story takes the player through a 20 Hour Story Mode before Finally reaching Level 30. Like Most MMO 's Reaching Level 30 is where the real game begins and the same is True for The Division . You will start out in Brooklyn which will be a very small " Training Map " that will introduce the player to the Very Basics of the Game then Story Events Will Take the Player to the Main Map Manhattan . There is lots and lots and lots of things to do in the division , you will never get bored . There are TONS of side missions and Events there is ALOT of lore if you like the story and the graphics are stunning so just walking around and exploring and enjoying the scenery can be fun all on its own . The game does feature a PvP Mode . To unlock PvP Mode you must be reach level 30 first . PvP Mode is held within The Dark Zone . Once a player enters the dark zone they immediately become available for other players to shoot at will . Shooting another player will mark you as a " Rogue Agent " Basically your PvP Flag is turned on and an Icon will appear over your character letting other players know that you 're a Rogue and your PvP Flag is on . Its screaming " Hey ! Attack me ! I wanna PvP !" lol . There is lots to do in PvP other than open world Fights . You can Go to an extraction Zone and Hijack Someone 's Cargo (Basically their inventory and Look ) and put it in your own . You can Kill other players while they are doing Side Missions and annoy them . Whatever you want to do to start a fight with other players in the DZ (Dark Zone ) Use your imagination because in the dark zone there are no Limits or Boundaries for PvP . Go Crazy . The population of players in the Division Are not bad but there not great either . Finding a player in matchmaking for a group can sometimes be very annoying and sometimes it 's an instant find . You can however do ANYTHING litterly anything Solo in the division as long as you have the right loadout . Nothing requires more than 1 player to start . The Servers themselves are Amazing . I personally LOVE the division servers . To be honest they are the best servers I have seen in a video game in a very long time . I have little to no problems with lag at all . No Connection Issues . Connecting to is very fast and non-problematic . The Servers on the Division are great . If you are worried about hackers and cheaters in this game , then you don 't have to worry because there are none of those in the division . The Division is a great clean game and Ubisoft done a great job at keeping cheaters out of the game . Downloadable Content : The Division Includes some downloadable Content : Survival and Underground . Underground is a PvE Focused DLC that takes the player into the underground part of Manhattan , the overrun subway tunnels that have been converted into strongholds by gangs and bases by Military Gangs . Players can set multiple different modifiers on an Underground operation to make them harder and give them better loot . Survival is a Mix of PvP and PvE DLC that is just like it sounds : When a survival game is started the player (s) spawn stranded in the middle of Manhattan During a Blizzard with no gear or supplies , or comms and are infected with Sepsis that threatens to kill them in an hour . The only thing the player has is a pistol that has no ammo which you have to find . The objective is to find the Vaccine hidden somewhere in Manhattan and then get to the Dark Zone for Extraction . Players only have 1 hour to do this before the Infection kills them which results in game over . Pro 's: -Open World -Side Missions -Activities -Events -Collectables and Lore to Find -10/10 Graphics -10/10 Server Performance -The Game is Kept Updated -The Servers are Great . -DLC -Con 's -The Community Could be bigger . It 's not dead but it 's not big either . -More of the Population Speaks Foreign language than English . Conclusion : The Division is an Amazing Open World Action Adventure MMO that will keep you infront of your computer for hours and hours . The Graphic 's are amazing and it 's just fun to walk around and explore and enjoy the world . The PvP is just as fun as the PvE and the servers are GREAT . The servers are some of the best servers I have seen in a video game in a very long time . There are no cheaters or hackers anywhere and the story is good . There is ALOT of things to do including DLC and you will never get bored with this game . I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves Open World Games , Shooters and MMO 's. Rating - 9.5/10

12874,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaguarusf/recommended/783210,jaguarusf,783210,The single player game features historical play around the Mediterranean or randomly generated maps with good customization options but potentially unbalanced starting positions . A scenario editor and mod support are also available . The interface could be improved ; specifically , the strategic overview that lists on-map objects and the political maps desperately need the ability to zoom in . Resources are collected from the map : mines , wood , and farms near cities automatically add their bounty nationwide . Cities can only produce specific units , and adding a new unit to a city 's production roster requires an investment of resources (on top of the cost of actually making the unit ), leading to interesting strategic decisions and less unit spam . Buildings outside of cities (such as the blacksmith , temple , and stable ) can buff resource production or allow for the recruitment of advanced units . Cities , buildings , and units can also be improved to increase stats . Units fall under the typical categories of settler , infantry , cavalry , and naval forces , but more sophisticated versions can be researched . Government type and state decisions can alter your approach . Diplomacy comes with a good number of options , but there is no feedback whether some options will be accepted (and why they were not ). Luckily , trade deals can be open-ended : you can request a specific resource and the partner will come back with an appropriate counter offer . Due to the time period , combat is relatively common , and the AI does a good job producing troops , attacking vulnerable units , and working well as a trade partner and ally . While Aggressors : Ancient Rome is more simplified than some other 4X games , it does not lack significant strategic decisions and its faster , combat-oriented pace is appealing . <url>

12880,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ECE94FSR/recommended/304410,ECE94FSR,304410,Hexcells Infinite *This review will not cover everything stated in my previous reviews about how it works etc . the focus will be on changes to the series and what has stayed the same . For basic information about the game check my first " Hexcells " review or the videos and pictures to get the idea . Learning from the 2 previous installments of the series " Hexcells Infinite " brings the probably popular request of a Puzzle Generator giving a " near " infinite amount of randomly generated puzzles that can be played . I will still say though that the quality of these levels feel a lot lower than the standard levels . As its most recent predecessor " Hexcells Plus " the game features 36 standard levels which increase in difficulty the further you go as more concepts are added and the complexity increases . You can not play the levels any order you like as you have to complete levels to unlock more . The system works by dividing the 36 levels into 6 worlds and awarding you a certain amount of " tiles " depending on level and how many mistakes you do . Once a world is unlocked you can play any of the six levels of that world in any order you like . The game has 7 achievements 5 for unlocking worlds 2-6 and the sixth for completing every level without mistakes (not in a row ), and in this game the extra seventh achievement is for completing 60 randomly generated levels . This means that it will most likely take 2-3 times as long to get all ach . in this game compared to " Hexcells Plus " Now for the improvements over " Hexcells Plus " the game is more " clever " . By this I mean that even some of the earlier levels can require some extra logic " outside of the box " to be completed . It was helpful being familiar to the game as it would probably have been hard without learning some advanced methods for determening which tiles can be excluded especially when combining different given information with eachother . This makes the game more challenging and the levels feel like they have a bit higher quality then before . As usual I will remind everyone that you should never ever have to guess to complete any of the levels . If you are stuck search for help / advice otherwise you remove the joy of legitimatley understanding and completing the puzzles which can be quite satisfying . To Conclude 36 levels Puzzle Generator 7 Achievements More Challenging than previous installments Time to completion 15-22 hours est .(all achievments legit ) -Randomly generated levels quickly feel the same -Pay almost twice for a puzzlegenerator (compared to Hexcells Plus ) Hexcells Infinite offers practically infinite replayability with the puzzle generator , though in my opinion the levels are of a lot lower quality then the original 36. I would recommend buying the " Logic Puzzle Pack " to get all Hexcells games aswell as " CrossCells " and " SquareCells " who are all great puzzle games . If you are set on getting just one of the Hexcells games I would recommend " Hexcells Plus " as it is cheaper and a better first approach than " Hexcells Infinite " to the series where the original game " Hexcells is a bit to easy to bother with . If you then like " Plus " you can get " Infinite " to get a bit more difficult version . The Bundles are cheap during sales but if you want to give extra support to the Dev Matthew Brown consider buying them / it on full price . / / ECE / /

Or perhaps go to Japan and become Shogun . Or unite Africa . Or take a European nation and rule Western Europe . All those options and more . The tutorial will give you the basics of the interface , but depending on your country , there are so many more things to learn . If you decide to try another country in your campagin , you can even save the game and choose a different country . This is a massive grand strategy game for all war game fans .

12900,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Undying_Zombie/recommended/700282,Undying_Zombie,700282,Due to what the devs plan on doing and have done . I can not recommend this despite being a huge fan of Nightmare on Elm Street . I am also tempted to leave a bad review for the game itself due to what they are doing with the game . The devs seem dead set on destroying what they have created and doing so bit by bit . They plan on nerfing Freddy based on numbers they know are skewed since he just came out . ( and everyone is going to play him ) As well as the lowest level of players . ( Rank20 ) You do not balance a game just off of the weakest players unless you want to kill off your game quickly . They just admitted to be doing so in the latest stream as of this review . ( Among other issues ) The funny thing is based on their own stats and how they talk they should be massively buffing one of the best killers in the game . ( The Nurse , who has a very high skill requirement but those who are able to are some of the best killer players in the game . ) Unless things change this review will remain a negative one . *UPDATE* Sorry Mathieu . You guys are balancing the game based off of skewed numbers . Numbers you know are not accurate and then try again to pretend its all fine . Not to mention saying that it will be balanced around new and rank 20 players . " Its not fair to judge it based off us doing this " Mathieu says . How disconnected from reality are you ? This might stay as a negative review from here on out now simply due to this . ( Linking their own vid for this . <url> The killer was not even out for a week , every killer + a bunch of survivors played him . So the numbers would be skewed . They know this but still decided to nerf him before giving it a chance . Not to mention other issues going on . This is just one small broken cog in the machine full of broken parts . ) *UPDATE 2 * Well after Mathieu got humiliated by a bunch of Korean players he got a small taste of what the game is really like . ( And the survivors he was facing where not even that good . ) Right afer that it was annoucned that they where going to make changes to flashlights and pallets . Tiny steps I guess . That said Istill can not recommened this DLC . He is currently the worst killer in the game , and that says a LOT when you consider how bad Wraith has been since launch .

Sure , some people will say it 's not for them , and those are the ones you probably should read because they tell you if the game will be for you because it wasn 't for them . The positive reviews might spoil it whether it be on purpose or not . If it 's laid out well , read it because it 's not going to . Play this game . If you don 't like it , at least play through the whole thing . It 's less than an hour and a half playthrough , so if you really hate it , then refund it . It 's really emotional , but also really fun at the same time . I 'm not gonna say anything else except buy this . (If you 're looking for something similar to The Stanley Parable , it 's similar , but the concept is nowhere near the same .)

12916,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/365120,stumpo,365120,This game is honestly not ready for primetime . I wanted to like it : a classic platformer built around picking up and throwing objects (like Super Mario Bros 2 !), with visuals that look like 16-bit +, and a transplant from the defunct XBLIG store which holds a special place in my heart ? Awesome . Unfortunately it 's not there yet . The first thing you 're greeting by when you get past the start screen is an ugly menu with an enormous font , and about 15 menu options laid out in a two column grid . Even though the menu is a two column grid , you can 't push left or right to navigate it , just up and down . The default key bindings are very poor , so I highly recommend you play on a controller . The game features a password system , which sounds like a fun bit of retro nostalgia , but the password system has the letters of the alphabet laid out in a grid ... that you can only navigate by pushing up and down . The main menu says " Press Start " , perhaps a holdover from XBLIG . If you go to exit you get this hideous developer mode prompt asking you if you 're sure you want to exit in huge poorly aligned text strings going across the screen . Why do I fixate on the menu ? Because it 's emblematic of how the game feels unfinished . Enter a level and you 'll see that the " coin " count (actually is are only one coin per level , a " hidden " collectible--this could probably be done differently in the UI ) is poorly aligned with the heart counter , which is vertical like SMB2 to its detriment . When you move between levels , the map seems to load with the camera facing very far away and then whip across the level with blinding speed to get back to you--this is hard on the eyes and again feels unfinished . This wouldn 't be a problem , except in a few levels the camera whips by enemies and plays their sounds , and many of the enemy sounds are very shrill and hard on the ears . When you die , the sound simply stops and the game pauses for a second before fading the foreground to black . The effect looks very strange , the lack of feedback is bad , and it 's slow . Consider what happens when you die in classic Super Mario Bros--the little ditty plays , the screen cuts to a lives counter (not applicable here ), but I 'm saying it shows how visual and audio feedback is part of how you design a game . That 's not present in CotCI DX Text boxes , which appear when you talk to characters in the game , has insufficient spacing between words so when you try to read the text it 's difficult to follow . There 's visible tile seams , as you can see in the screenshot . Some bricks look fine but often the tile textures seem unfinished . The backgrounds are wildly inconsistent : some backgrounds , like the one you can see in the screenshot above with the pig king , have a cool parallax effect . Others are static images but animated . Several levels just have pure black backgrounds . The entire game the camera feels a little too zoomed in . An important part of designing a platformer is ensuring the right balance between your character being large enough to see and provide details , but small enough so that jumping and moving feels good . Several levels feature points where it 's difficult to see far enough around your character to see what you 're doing . Much of the level design is oddly boxy . Many of the levels are enormous , particularly those that use the gravity-inverting powerup to send you flying through a vast expanse . Big maps are generally a bad idea when designing a game , but they 're a temptation for every first-time game designer . Then , platforming or puzzles levels typically are very small and cramped and much of the platforming involves putting low ceilings so that you can 't jump near your full height . Because the main mechanic of the game is carrying objects and the developers want to force you to drop the objects to get past certain sections , I understand why they did this kind of cramped design , but it makes the levels feel kinda janky . At least two levels that I noticed make it possible to get stuck mid level . One is the puzzle level around mid-way through where you need to pick up an orange guy at the beggining , boost on top of a column , and then throw a icicle guy right . The other is the final boss level , where if you accidentally drop your weapon in the (?) second last phase , you can 't kill him . You can restart the current level through the menu , but again it 's just a frustrating experience . The final boss is pretty annoying in general . If you die , which is somewhat likely as you 're learning his patterns , you restart at the beginning of the boss stage . This is fine , except you need to walk a few seconds to get to the boss and then talk to him , and then sit through a cutscene . This is a mistake that many professional games make , but it 's annoying regardless . The ending is weird , there 's a smash cut from the final boss (no effect to see him dying or fade out or anything ) into the ending , which is a static image with some text . The text looked like it didn 't end properly , but no buttons I tried moved on to the next part of the text , except Enter / Start which just booted me back to the menu . My playtime above includes idling the cards , but the game actually takes about 60-90 minutes . For replay you 're encouraged to play as a second character , play a boss rush , and play a speedrun mode . I think this is fine value for money , but you should know what you 're getting into . In general this is a fun game and if you bought it I don 't think you 'd regret it . My issue is that this is not ready for release on Steam . Playtesting should have called attention to these issues and more , especially the menu / UI stuff which is immediately apparent . If this were an early access title , I 'd recommend it and trust the developers would fix these issues , but this has been out for a while and has had some updates . It 's beyond me why many of the issues I 've raised in this review would have escaped the notice of the developer , and so the result is a game that feels sloppy and unpolished even though the core is a good looking , good sounding , interesting idea for a retro platformer .

12918,https://steamcommunity.com/id/supaserrin/recommended/318600,supaserrin,318600,To all of the people who say this game can get too boring too fast : From the beginning of the game , you notice there are different types of locations , each with their own loot . That alone gives you a reason to explore and collect different materials to craft very different things . Then , you need to get warmer equipment by hunting animals , while also making sure you don 't starve . Searching and collecting everything that you need is not boring , and when you finally get those sweet steel tools it feels nice to be able to craft the best clothes and the bow . The raft can be very tricky to control , but that 's fine , because if it was easy as hell , THEN it could be called boring . But you have to be constantly on the lookout for the nearest camp and boost to it as soon as you see it , or you will just miss it completely because of the strong river current . You also need to pay attention to dodge as much {?} as you can , for repairs can be hard to obtain , especially in the early game . Also , there is a very nice sense of progression . You start finding more wild life . First some bunnies , then a boar , then a wolf , then multiple wolves at the same time ... and apparently there are bears too , which I have yet to find after hours of gameplay . Fighting them is also not boring at all , and it feels rewarding to get the skin off them as a proof of survival . Some people also say having the game not paused while crafting is unfair , and while it does make the game harder , it is refreshing to see you actually have to find a safe place to derp around with your inventory , and having to quickly interrupt what you are doing if a storm catches you to find shelter makes it more realistic . In the wild forests , when you least expect it , things can get really chaotic : -Be exploring around a building . -Notice 3 wolves . -Panic and throw all your poisoned meat at them while they claw at you . -2 of them die . -Realize you don 't have any more traps . -Pull out your bow and 3 arrows . -Miss the first shot . -Land an arrow and watch how the wolf goes out screen . -Think he is dead , begin healing yourself . -The wolf comes back , arrow stuck on his body , attacks you while you 're healing . -Panickly get your bow back out and aim carefully . You want to shoot fast , but it 's your last arrow . -Aim carefully and shoot . Land a hit , the wolf falls dead to the ground . -Heal your multiple wounds with bandages , while the adrenaline on your body expires . If THAT is not getting more interesting , I don 't know what is . Can 't wait to find my first bear .

12925,https://steamcommunity.com/id/manicado/recommended/658570,manicado,658570,Video review - <url> Building your indie game around an online experience with a high initial price is more often than not suicide . This game suffers the same fatal problem many other online based indie games face - A dead playerbase , even upon launch . This pretty much turns this game into an expensive drift sandbox . I 'd rather recommend GRID series instead or any other game with drifting and single player . There is no real single player mode to this game , just a simple practice mode where you 're alone doing drifts and to even include DLC is absolutely absurd . Yes it 's only visual , but what is the point of that ? The price is already through the roof as it is . Without online all the game falls down to being is an offline sandbox of pointless non-objective based drifting . That being said , I could 've had miniscule fun drifting around pointlessly for a bit but sadly I couldn 't even have that , as the game didn 't even include controller support .

12932,https://steamcommunity.com/id/IAMThePHiLsTeR/recommended/638970,IAMThePHiLsTeR,638970,This game is amazing . The characters are everything you 'd imagine a real gangster / mobster would be . The main characters , Kiryu and Majima are very memorable and I look forward to playing the other Yakuza games as this is the only one I 've played so far . The story is really good and could easily have made a good movie . There are many story arcs that are intertwined . Since this is Yakuza 0 , this installment probably tells Kiryu 's and Majima 's origin stories . The two characters start from humble beginnings and as the story develops their badassary grows a 100 fold . One scene even gave me chills as one of the bosses in the game finally acknowledges Kiryu as a true Yakuza . This game does have some flaws , but they are forgivable because of how good the story is . The gameplay itself is fun for the most part . However , it is really easy because you can hold as many as 25 healing items which makes everything a joke . I barely had to upgrade my characters past their tier 1 upgrades . It would have been better if the game didn 't let you carry healing items which would force the player to be more careful as opposed to just button mashing . The last chapter of the game gets harder but its more of a cheap difficulty than anything . Enemies are mostly restricted to fists or melee weapons , but in the last chapter some enemies carry firearms . When shot it creates a horrible stun , where you 're knocked down on the floor for a good 5 seconds . Then when you try to run and beat the guys with fire arm , the rest of the enemies stun lock you only for you to be shot and downed again . However , this fustration doesn 't last long and is only included in some segments in the last chapter . There are also lots of side quests and a good variety of mini-games that can provide some entertainment . However , I found the most fun in the main story . If you love authentic gangster / mob stories , then this is a no brainer ! Get the game !!

Compared to Trine 1 and 2 , this game has easier combat and harder puzzles . Death is cheap and the puzzles aren 't just " build a pile of crates with Amadeus " , you actually have to use the other characters . This game has collectibles that are actually satisfying to collect . Some are hidden but not in a coonvoluted way and after you beat a stage , you can see on which areas of that stage you missed a collectible . I recommend this game if you buy it on a sale .
12949,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/571060,stumpo,571060,There are basically two things you should know about this game : first , is it a good game ; second , is it a good port . To the first question , Zork Nemesis is among the best first-person point-and-click games of its era , and maybe my favourite outside Cyan Worlds ' Myst / Riven . The plot involves you entering an ancient , run-down temple and learning about the plight of four great alchemists who have been trapped in a state of purgatory by an evil presence called Nemesis . Of course , like many great adventure games , things are not as simple as they seem . It is a great game with tough but fair difficulty , no arbitrary deaths , a great little story , excellent cutscene direction , and really interesting and varied locations . If you take notes you should be able to beat the game without restoring to a guide , but there are also many guides online if you need to cheat . It is well worth the $5.99. The graphics are pre-rendered backgrounds with live action FMV playing on top of them , which at the time was very exciting and cutting edge . Also very nice music and sound effects , they really made the most of the 3 or 4 CDs the game shipped on . Compared with other games in the genre , it has a darker and more sinister tone . It 's not quite horror , but at times it 's close : for example , one segment involves you decapitating a cadaver with a guillotine and hooking up the severed head to electrodes . This is not the light-hearted comedy of the traditional Zork games , although there are jokes here and there . To the second question , I think the quality of the port is mixed . First , the game was released in two versions : Windows 95 and DOS . This is the DOS version , emulated through DOSBOX . There are no achievements , trading cards , gamepad controls , graphical settings , etc . Moreover , the DOS version requires you to use keyboard commands to save (Ctrl+S), load (Ctrl+R), exit (Ctrl+Q), and set options (Ctrl+P) because there are no menus . Please read the manual before you play to help with this . There are two minor technical issues -- some slight sound crackling , and mouse sensitivity is way too high . The bulk of the game is navigated through panning your field of view with the mouse , and so high mouse sensitivity makes it difficult to control . You can set it to a lower sensitivity in the preferences , but even on the lowest setting , it is too sensitive . This appears to be a the GOG .com version , which also suffered from these issues . There is also a question of the game holding up . It runs at 640x480 ; the FMV overlays are highly compressed , interlaced , low resolution video . Some of the game 's beautiful visual designs look blurry or low detail because of the resolution , and there are a handful of puzzles where you must be very very precise with the mouse because click targets are quite small . This is definitely not modernized or ready for 2017 , so I would recommend you be sure that you can handle something feeling dated before you jump in . I highly recommend the game . The playtime listed above is until completion on a replay ; someone playing for the first time without a guide would be looking at probably 10-12 hours , maybe a little more .

12955,https://steamcommunity.com/id/atisz2/recommended/409600,atisz2,409600,Contract with The Devil is a low-priced hidden object game from a Ukrainian developer with well animated visuals and interesting puzzles offering a promising storyline . Unfortunately the game doesn 't know whether it should concentrate on the horror or the cuteness factor (the 2 are kind of mutually exclusive ) and there are some bugs present . The game is still good , but could have been much better . Sonya receives a letter from a person named John McGraw , stating he has some information regarding her daughter . Upon his invitation the mother decides to pay this strange completely normal man a visit , in his mansion . On arrival , she is asked to take a look at - or rather into - a mirror (?), which she does and whoosh , her daughter is taken by a sinister entity . Before the portal closes (because that 's what the mirror really is ) a leprechaun jumps out (!) of it . He introduces himself as a household spirit (whatever that is ) and offers his help in finding and saving Sonya 's daughter . The title pretty much foreshadows what we might expect during our adventure . The game features some refreshing puzzles (which I prefer in these types of games ) - mixed with the usual hidden object scenes - like finding and matching logical pairs (horse - horsehoe , flower - watering can , etc .), some (plenty of ) reassembling tasks and creative minigames realted to little demons . We have to defeat / capture the mentioned 7 little demons representing the 7 deadly sins (however instead of lust and pride , there 's anger and power lust for some reason ). Finding all 7 of them will take us to many exciting locations , such as an ice world or old places from the past of John McGraw , until the point where we can finally confront the evil antagonist . The problem with these demons is that their design isn 't really scary , but kind of childish looking and it pretty much ruins the general creepy atmosphere of the game . To make things worse they don 't speak , but mumble (or I don 't even know how to call that sound they make ) in a really irritating manner . Additional story elements and clues can be found on notes , which I always like , so much better than trying to guess 'where should I go , what should I do now ?'. Our diary is very useful and does contain information which can help us if we get stuck . As we proceed we 'll have the opportunity to watch plenty of cutscenes telling the story of John McGraw and even our own , furthermore of Lisa (our daughter ) through flashbacks . The game has its fair share of bugs : I had to restart (delete the profile and make a new one ) the game since it kept on skipping the minigames automatically for no apparent reason at first (2nd time it worked fine though ). Occasionally some of the texts are displayed in Ukrainian , despite having played it in English plus there 's no voice acting (only in the intro ) and the subtitles disappear way too fast sometimes . Another issue is that there are HO scenes where clicking on an object does not always register at first . The game also froze once . It 's a shame these aren 't fixed , since this is one of the advantages of platforms such as Steam : developers can fix and update their game anytime . The graphics are nice and atmospheric (for a HOG ) with plenty of spooky , outdoor locations and dynamic background elements . Unfortunately the game uses the old 1024x768 standard resolution from the pre-2010 era , so it doesn 't look too good on 16 :9 screens . The movement of the characters look weird in the cutscenes sometimes , but otherwise they are also well made . Even though the sound effects are generally good , they appear to be mono , which is a shame since some of the recent HOGs have very good environmental audio . As mentioned , the voice-over only exists in the opening cutscene but even there it 's barely audible because the sound effects and the music suppress it . Despite its flaws (the bugs mostly ) Contract with The Devil is still a pretty good hidden object game with challenging puzzles and fun minigames , so if you like the genre , give it a try and since none of the bugs are game-breaking and a restart always works , they can be overlooked . PROS + nice artwork + good puzzles and minigames + plenty of cutscenes + low price tag for its length CONS - a handful of bugs - atmosphere is killed by the little " demons " - mono sound , no voice-over - 1024x768 resolution RATING 6/10

12957,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ShortRaver/recommended/250400,ShortRaver,250400," How to Survive " can be a pretty intense game on the harder difficulties , even with a co-op partner in toe . But nonetheless , this isometric survival game focuses on the management of your inventory , basic needs whilst being alert for the next zombie ambush . and it makes the game a great couch co-op title . It 's intense at times , with a little bit of a laugh or sigh of frustration on the side , it 's a game that you shouldn 't look past even with the saturation of the " Zombie Survival Horror " genre .
12958,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197992206547/recommended/403640,76561197992206547,403640,Very nice sequel and for the most part on par with the previous game . The gameplay is defenitely more challenging than the first game due to level design , the enemies you are up against and their awareness . It is harder to get a low chaos rating during the playthrough now . The clockwork soldiers (mechanical enemies ) can be a pain in the behind sometimes , because they are hard to kill and and hard to get passed without alerting them . So far I liked the story more in the first game , but the lore around it is just as good . When you are exploring you will find a lot of notes and books again that adds more depth to the story and immersion . An other nice addition to the game is that you can now play the main story as 2 different characters with their own story line . I am still in my first playthrough (playing as Emily ), but it is nice to know that I can play my 2nd playthrough from a different perspective . What I do miss from the previous game is being able to upgrade ammo count . If you do run into trouble during the playthrough then you will be out of ammo in no time now so stealth (low chaos ) is sort of mandatory if you want a smooth ride . (EDIT: you can still upgrade ammo count , it was on a different upgrade page that I had overlooked !!) The game does seem to be less optimized than the first game . I still get a good fps on high settings , but the fps dips at some places and I am not sure why . If I stand on a certain spot it can dip from 60fps down to 45 and when I walk 1 meter further it is suddenly 60fps again . There is a lot of gameplay content in the game plus a second playthrough with a different character so you get a lot of bang for your bucks . If you liked the first game then Dishonored 2 is a must have ! EDIT 2 : I am at the end of the game now and it has been a total blast to play . There were really nice design surprises in the game and the overall gameplay is better and more tactical than the first game ! Especially a few levels stand out in the game and are really well designed . The AI is also buffed compared to the first game and they are far more aware of their surroundings which makes stealth even more immersive and feels more rewarding when everything goes right .

12961,https://steamcommunity.com/id/supercapybara/recommended/305260,supercapybara,305260,Always the same Facebook games . You start playing a tutorial with the same story (your base is under attack or you found a enemy base and need to recover it ), always the same gameplay (construct things and protect your turrets to prevent enemies to farm you ) etc . If you want original and exclusive games , this is not for you . The only reason I see to play this is if you are having any problem when playing similar games from the browser . Because this one will give you superior performance . I have a few better games to recommend to you , if you like this style : Galaxy Wars Clash of Clans (Android, but you can easly emulate it in your computer , there is a bunch of softwares to do that ) The Last Stand : Dead Zone Castle Clash : The New Adventure They are a lot better than this .

12972,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ShortRaver/recommended/307780,ShortRaver,307780,NOTE : THE MULTIPLAYER IS BROKEN AS OF THIS REVIEW . It was tough to decide whether to recommend this version of Mortal Kombat X , as it will solely depend on the user . I chose not to recommend the game as the core function of the game , the multiplayer , is broken , but please read on if you want more information . On one hand , my experience playing the story campaign was a great , the plot was entertaining and the game itself was easy to pick and play , with on-the-fly difficulty changes to make it more satisfying for the less experienced of players . The additional modes including a revamped Krypt (those damn spiders get me every time ) are very much welcome . However , my multiplayer experience is where the game falls apart . I can 't get into any matches , making it only as far as the character select screen before it disconnects from lag (and I have a rock solid net connection ). Until any fixes are made , I would steer clear from picking this up at all . Performance was fine , sitting on a consistent 60FPS with max settings (and as MKX is using the UE4 engine , it 's a pretty game to boot ). A note to mention though is that the x-rays and in-game cutscenes , I believe are locked to 30FPS . I do have a high end rig which may have assisted , but generally I did not suffer from any issues . So all in all , it 's a great game , but until the Multiplayer modes are fixed , I cannot recommend this version of the game .

Other jumps are just too high : you cant make it to the top part of a level unless you hit the exact last 2 frames of a jump . It 's just bad . I really wanted to like this , but I can 't.

This is a platform game in which you must solve some puzzles and play some mini-games to advance . As I said , graphics are really , really wonderful . Developers use different color palettes depending on the part of the world the priest visits and there are a lot of elements (for example : air , fire , darkness and light ) very well integrated in it . Music and sounds are really good , and voice acting is also great . The game is really easy . Of course , you can die , but the game allows you to continue near the same place and there are some checkpoints to save your progress . You must finish it twice if you want to collect all the achievements . The game also drops cards . In my opinion , it 's a good game but a bit expensive , so buy it in sales if you want to play it .

13006,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wuschel/recommended/225540,Wuschel,225540,As someone who beat Just Cause 1 and 2 I can say that the third installment is the best game of the series so far . Not only the controls feel much better , the new gadgets like the (Bavarium powered ) wingsuit and the retracting tethers alone sell it for me . Out of ammo ? Just pull a helicopter into a gas tank and watch it explode . The world design is just amazingly done and beautiful . It is smaller than Panau from Just Cause 2 , but also better filled with interesting landmarks and a better variety of things to blow up . Yes the story and characters are as cheesy as they can get . But do you really expect some serious characters with a rich and interesting past to tell you about ? This game is just like it 's predecessors a playable action movie with a lot of freedom where you can play with your creativity . But there are three big downsides which are pretty much unnecessary and could 've been avoided in making this game . First flaw : The performance is sometimes and without tweaking a catastrophe . My PC is not high-end anymore but way over the recommended requirements (i5 6600 , 16GB ram , GTX1060 , game installed on SSD ) and the FPS sometimes just tank down to 20 FPS . But that luckily rarely happened in my almost 60 hours of play time . A simple restart of the game also fixed that for me . There is a very helpful guide in the steam guides posted that helps fixing the performance completely . Aside from the framedrops that I mentioned earlier the game ran always at over 60 FPS with all settings on maximum . Second flaw : The field of view . You can 't change it ingame and unfortunately I get dizzy and queasy after only playing the game for a couple of minutes . But there is a fix for that called justFOV . Which leads my to my last downside of the game . Third flaw : The game tends to crash randomly with the same error message (code:38). I found out that the game tends to crash on a regular basis when you tab out of the game at least once . I had to do it every time I started justFOV to fix the field of view . But I found a solution to that but that only works when you have at least 2 monitors . When you are in the game , open the map and move your cursor out of the game to the second monitor . You have to put the justFOV .exe there and simply start it . The game didn 't minimized itself even though I wasn 't using borderless window mode because it adds mouse lag . Then just move your cursor into the game again and continue playing . The game did not crash once when I was playing it for hours straight when I had started the tool like this . When I alt +tabbed out of the game it always crashed after a short period of time . I was also reading that you should never start up the game using your controller . It will lead to a memory leak that will crash the game after some time . All in all I would still recommend this game to everyone who likes a good action open world sandbox , even though the setup is annoying . But the fun you will get out of this game is worth taking the 10 minutes to configure it . As long as you don 't tab out of the game of course . :p Rating : 8/10
13007,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Chuckyd2001/recommended/447040,Chuckyd2001,447040,Disappointing start to the series with the first watch dogs , even though I play many hours I did quite like it . However Watch Dogs 2 massively improves in my opinion to the first game . The city looks amazing and feels like a living city . The story and the stealth could be improved but everything else I really enjoy . It has some new interesting ideas that I haven 't seen in many other games and is worth a buy .

In my opinion is a lot better story then Heileen 1 and really don 't have to play 1 unless you want more background on some of the characters . My favorite character has to be Black . He 's a cat that accompanies Heileen in most of the journey . The endings are mostly good some are extremely close to another but all of them by right feels different . Going to try get the rest of the endings still enjoying the story it 's a nice pick up but wouldn 't reccomend the first one unless like I said you want a start but I feel didn 't add really anything to the second part

13016,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zombiecat1/recommended/232090,zombiecat1,232090,Great upgrade from KF1. However I have some minor complaints ..but as this is early access don 't take this review as a review for the full release . -New clot camera spinning is annoying as hell ...when your focusing on a big zed and all of a sudden the camera turns to a clot grabbing on to you is just bad game design . KF1 Had it right where you could still focus on different enemies and not be forced to deal with 1. - Don 't use crosshairs for your own sake - Some audio issues ..I found when having a large crowd engage you and your team mates the audio would fritz and just sound like a mess . -Performance wise , the game runs incredibly well ..But I 'm currently playing on a laptop with an i5 3337U and a 740m with 16gb of ram and 64 bit windows 8.1. If you have a meety machine then crank up those bodies ! Overall I 'm very happy with the state of the game for now . I cannot wait until modding comes in and we can experience 30-50 player servers with tower defense style maps , wtf rocket launchers , nukes , orbital strikes , air strikes , turrets and more ! EDIT : 15/07/2015 Seems like the audio issues relate to the use of a dual core cpu which i used to play the game . Hopefully this gets solved soon . EDIT : 21/10/2015 playing on my quad core i5 2500k seems to have fixed issues and the game runs at a buttery smooth 60 fps , theres been alot of time since initial ea release and so theres ben plenty of community maps and all sorts of custom stuff being put into the game . definitely worth picking up now with the current amount of content and more to come in the future ! 23/06/2017 The game has received alot of updates since this review went up ...and the peformance has only gone up and theres alot of content to play with ...highly recommended .

All for the big Triple Steam Summer Sale of the Century but all of a sudden his computer gets sabotaged and all traces of " The Big 3 " are lost . Join GabeN and Mike on their quest to investigate who is responsible for this . Is it the Illuminati that are behind this and trying to destroy Valve ? Gladdos , The Administrator , Wallace Breen , Hihilanth and Gordon are characters from HL2 , Portal 2 and TF2. Gameplay This RPG game reminds me of a 3rd Generation Pokemon game as it has a rather similar fight scene , gold system , item obtainment etc . There are also various weapons to choose from the Community Store , so be careful when choosing your weapons as they deal different damage . A friendly tip : Make sure to heal yourself often and have full HP before the final boss fight . Prepare yourself well , as the battle will take quite awhile . Also I won 't spoil the surprise by telling you who the final boss is . Pros + Wonderful soundtrack . + Simple to play . + Trading cards . + 13 achievements (121 broken achievements permanently removed ). + Various weapons , potions and gold inside treasure chests . + Has a save function which allows up to 20 individual saves . Cons - Labyrinth battles are tedious and repetitious . - Enemies spawn every few seconds in the maze . Final Thoughts I found this an enjoyable game to play and it is well worth the price . I died laughing from the humorous dialogs throughout the game . However , I am sorry to admit that I didn 't make it to the final boss and HAD to watch it on a walk thru . Nonetheless , I wish you all the best on your journey !

13019,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hangedman/recommended/597220,hangedman,597220,This game is relentlessly low-key hilarious . It 's absurd and silly , but oddly grounded . It 's one of the most complex CRPGs I 've played in years , where your choices actually matter and you can miss entire chunks of content . But it 's also very replayable . Give it a shot . It 's well worth it .

It 's a really worth while purchase if you like cute platformers . Can be completed up to 100% quite fast as well . Pretty much must have if it 's on sale . ALL HAIL THE JUJU !

13022,https://steamcommunity.com/id/solongandthanxforallthefish/recommended/311190,solongandthanxforallthefish,311190,The look of this game makes people think it 's simple or childish , but that couldn 't be further from the truth . Whether you are a casual gamer that just wants to enjoy a fun game with a good story , to a hardcore gamer who prefers roguelites and rage-quitting , this game has you in mind ! tl ;dr / quick review Super Panda Adventures is a one of the best examples of the Metroidvania genre on Steam . It has solid mechanics , fluid and smooth controls , an excellent soundtrack , fun shoot-slash-and-jump combat , and is genuinely funny . Super Panda Adventures is different and really took me by surprise ; so much so , that it has made my list of all-time favourites PC games . I am not sure if it gets the attention that it deserves , but this is truly a genre-defining game . With a slew of RPG elements in the game , you can level up your character all the way to Level 50 with several weapon , armour , skill and spell choices to make along the way . How you build your character ultimately affects how you play the game , and visa-versa ! Along those lines , it has a lot of stats to explore : HP , MP , Shield , Regen for MP , Crit , Melee damage , Magic damage , random-events skills like " Chance to gain 5 Hp when you attack an enemy ," and shops to spend collected coins on items and potions ! verdict Super Panda Adventures is simply one of the most under-rated and over-looked Metroidvanian games on Steam . If you like Metroidvania type games , you owe it to yourself to buy and play this game . what 's good + 8 to 12 hours of gameplay + Full controller support + Well-written and amusing dialogue + Adorably cute , deceptively challenging (at higher difficulty levels ) + Varied , colourful and thought-out level designs that always keep it fresh + Many RPG elements for levelling up your character (up to Level 50 !) + It 's not a platformer , so there is no platformer rage-quitting in this game + Good for all skill levels (from Casual to Srsly Hardcore ) + Level-up , gain new and significant powers , skills , magic , weapons , armour , and more + Character appearance changes based on selected weapons , amour , and skills + Excellent and catchy soundtrack + Hidden / secret rooms filled with treasures to find + Fluid , smooth , and superb-feeling controls + Suitable for all ages and skill-levels what 's not good - Once a difficulty setting has been selected , it cannot be changed without starting a new game - Sudden , unexpected difficulty spikes (see note below ) gameplay tip Frankly , some of the bosses are surprisingly over-powered and this can result in some unexpectedly frustrating boss battles . Say you decide to play on Normal , but it gets too hard 8 hours in , you can either push through , in which case , watching a youtube video may help with your strategy ; or , start the game over and select a lower difficulty setting . May I suggest a better-safe-than-sorry approach to this game : The typical gamer should play this on either the Cakewalk or Easy difficulty setting , which will provide a rage-free (not challenge-free ) ride through this game . Only experienced , pain-seeking gamers should attempt Normal or Hard . Either way , enjoy the game , this is a great one ! Please hit the like button if you found this review helpful .

The game 's plot is nice and clean along with many references which make the game better and better . There are many items and customizations to buy with your in-game money . There are power-ups , hair styles , tattoos , weapons , cool shades , and even coffee . The missions are pleasing and interesting as well as the characters . You can also switch between different graphic settings to make your game look like it was made for the NES , Virtual Boy , Commodore , etc . The soundtrack is also catchy and fitting to the gameplay . 9/10
13031,https://steamcommunity.com/id/desolater_iv/recommended/952880,desolater_iv,952880,Honestly , its terrible . You can 't expect much from a game with " Hentai " in the title , its just clickbait . <url>
13032,https://steamcommunity.com/id/idatensama/recommended/200940,idatensama,200940,At first I was somewhat excited to hear that SEGA was going to port one of the best Sonic games out there on PC . Finally , after years of wating for the official release we get it . The game itself is great , no doubt . The question is though whether it is a good port or just a quick buck for the company we all love . In short - it 's a mixed bag . It 's nice to see that SEGA hired Christian Whitehead to make this port and initially I was prepared for some top-notch level content . Despite the fact that Sonic 1 and Sonic 2 mobile conversions strived to enhance the experience of the original works , this very port barely does anything to make playing it worthwhile . Pros : - At it 's core , it 's still Sonic CD with it 's unique level design that caters for speedrunning if you put enough effort into it . - You can choose between US / JP soundtrack . - Tails is avaiable as a playable character . Cons : - The input lag is noticable but managable . Going for the best time might be extremely difficult at times . - Sonic 's acceletaion is slower and he feels somewhat heavier than in the original . The input lag is probably the reason why . - The first two cons make Collision Chaos Zone a chore to play . - Hitboxes for most of the enemies were changed which may result in you accidentally running into one of the badniks (although you might think you are far enough from it ). - Bugs . Metallic Madness Act3. The laser bug room . Many times so it happened that I could not hit an enemy despite it being super close to me and at its vulnerable state . This is sad . - A lot of cuts and other engine-imperfection moments were fixed which is bad if you want some fast-paced experience without compromises just like in the original and good if you 're willing to play the way it was intended . Overall , I would not recommend this port to people who are going to play Sonic CD for the first time . Being unable to control the game with immediate output can negatively impact your playthrough and form a negative opinion of this highly praised entry in the series of the blue hedgehog . P .S It 's an ~okay~ port .

I hoped for a thrilling Holmes-adventure and got a linear , sometimes highly illogical point and click adventure with bad graphic and worse voice acting . Not to mention the camera and controlls . This was one of these games , I was actually happy to finish - not because it was so fun - but because it wasn 't. Well ... I think at least it wasn 't so bad , that I couldn 't even finish it - but the reason for that could be , that I hoped the ending to be worthy of the connection to Lovecraft (which it wasn 't).

13045,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ThreeSon/recommended/639790,ThreeSon,639790,Casual shmup meets waifu fantasy , in a Hotline Miami-style universe . Not enough gameplay variety and several minor bugs , but nice presentation and low price . (Edit: The dev has been great about fixing reported issues .) Heavily inspired by While 's 2001 PC game Sentimental Shooting . There are two objectives in each stage - shoot down ships to gain score and unlock more stages , and break apart the girls ' clothing piece by piece . The artwork is censored by default , but there is a quick fix available , which worked for me . The best part about the game is the overall art style and presentation . Although it 's derivative of Hotline Miami , it works well here and creates a pleasant , dreamy atmosphere which fits the mood of the game nicely . There are also some cool animation details - I liked the way the girls ' hair flutters when shot by the player 's ship , for example . I wish there were more of that . There are English and Japanese language options , but the voice samples are all in English . The voices are not unique for each girl (just one for all of them ) which is disappointing , but since they don 't say much it wasn 't a big deal for me . On the plus side , the English translation is pretty good . This is seen in the Tinder-like profiles for each girl in the menu . They are brief but well-written and funny . There 's not much music - only 3 or 4 tracks total I think - but it 's high-quality stuff . It would be a nice bonus to have these songs available outside the game , if possible . The actual gameplay is mediocre at best . Shmup veterans will not be satisfied - it 's too easy and the mechanics are too simplistic . There 's almost no variety and only about 10 enemies total through the whole game , including bosses . There are also a lot of little graphical bugs that I encountered - corrupted stage backgrounds and misaligned sprites and such . The game will need a patch or two . (Edit: Not anymore .) Controller support is okay , although you can 't pause the game with the controller - you have to hit ESC on the keyboard . I 'm using a Dual Shock 4 so maybe XBox gamepad owners won 't have this problem . In any case , the keyboard and mouse controls work fine (the mouse can only be used for firing , not ship movement ). There are Steam achievements but no leaderboards . Normally leaderboards should be a requirement for any shmup on Steam , but in this case it wouldn 't do much good because the scoring is too basic for it to matter . It will not take long to get 100% of the achievements if that matters to you . It took me just shy of 3 hours to unlock all of them , and that included a profile reset about half way through . For most players it should take a little over 2 hours . So then , weak gameplay but I still liked it overall . There aren 't many other sexy shmups like this available , at least not on Steam . The only other one I know of is Heartomics which I haven 't played yet . The uniqueness and the $2 price are ultimately why I think this is worth picking up . I hope it sells well enough that the devs consider a more ambitious sequel , with greater complexity and an expanded story .

The " Black Throne Elevator Glitch " is a more immediate example that comes to mind in regards to how the game can force you to completely restart due to a glitch the community has known about for years . Indeed , if you are a completionist , save frequently , and save multiple files . Despite having an interesting premise and some above-average gameplay , Darksiders has simply not aged well . If you can catch the title on sale like I did (for around $2), then I would say that it is certainly worth the price - just keep in mind that it can be a mess at times .

GameLoading offers a broader look at a wider cross-section of the independent games scene , a bit more relaxed and conversational and a bit less cinematic than similar docs . It seems to assume a lot on the part of its audience , as if it was made more for the community itself than for others outside it . But it does highlight people scraping by (and failing ) rather than just showing big successes , which is far more useful to people who aspire to make games , so that is in service to its audience . If non-industry viewers can keep up , they 'll see some interesting stuff come together , and maybe they 'll come out of it thinking of games as something more complex .

Let 's be clear : if you 've never been a 2D platformer player , this probably won 't sway you . The game requires skill , but has a decent learning curve . On the other hand , it seldom holds your hand through the different obstacles and platforming mechanics . But it 's a very enjoyable ride , because you 're playing a very cute game with fun dialogue and characters . Don 't expect much of a storyline in the original campaign , but it 's still nice . As for Plague of Shadows , it 's an amazing free DLC . It plays very , very differently from the Shovel Knight campaign , as Plague Knight throws potions and can sometimes do four jumps in a row using different items and mechanics . Plague of Shadows has more of a storyline , and it 's cute-as-heck . Shovel Knight is clearly a labour of love , and I can 't recommend it enough .

13084,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cringkamp/recommended/237990,cringkamp,237990,A game that intially challenged me in ways I hadn 't thought possible , left me frustrated and wanting in the end . The Banner Saga is definitely a well thought out and emotionaly rich gaming experience that is simultaneosly fresh and perfectly nostalgic . The art style is beautiful and full of vibrant colors and unique character drawings . It does , however , become flat as the game progress and very little is added to the initial showing . The gameplay is smooth and the tactical elements are spot on . Overal the game feels somewhat incomplete , which is unfortunate . I would be more understanding if I knew for sure that part 2 and 3 would be included in my orignal $25 dollar purchase . The game only ran about 10 hours or less and each installment is along the same lines I 'm looking at $75 for three short games . If the game goes on sale below $20 it is definitely worth picking up .

Be warned though , this is a game for folks who really enjoy turn-based strategy games (TBS), especially multi-player TBS (Disclaimer: I have not tried Dominions 4 MP yet , but Dominions 3 MP was tremendous ). But if you are looking for high-end graphics , a gentle learning curve , hand-holding tutorials or a casual strategy gaming experience , you may want to look elsewhere . However , if you are a fan of TBS games , Dominions 4 has tremendous depth , content and attention to detail . From the ability to customize your god to each race with unique abilities , there are many variables to make each game unique . Gameplay can be a bit daunting initially , but rewards players who carefully plan and execute those strategies . My only negative at this time regarding Dominions 4 is it appears to be a bit too similar to Dominions 3 which I played heavily in the pre-Steam days . I 'll update this review after additional playtime with other factions and MP to highlight some of the changes from Dominions 3.

I am really falling in love with this game ! I also play D &D online , and I love that game too . The big differense between these two is definately to GW 's advantage : GW has a way better story (ies), it is much easier to play single ( which I prefer , and many with me ), - And : You buy the game once , and then it is fully paid ! With D &D online and most other MMORPGs , you have to pay a fee continually . Think I 'm gonna play this for years ! :)))

13093,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ZhugeKe/recommended/658970,ZhugeKe,658970,After playing for a few months now and nearly 2000 hours , the game itself is very good , however they have CA which moderate the game and most do not understand their own official rules , which if you try to ask them about the rules , they get very crabby and decide to try to bully you aswell , so lets start with a few Pros and Cons ! Repeatedly asking / begging for any in-game currency / items - is not NO Begging . Pros : - Game has lots of mini-games to offer . - Can build Casinos and decorate them - Can earn the Cash shop currency just playing Cons : - Lots of the CA Staff don 't understand their own rules and make up and enforce ones that aren 't even official , then defended further by their head CA , which makes little sense considering their suppose to know their official rules . - Community has many toxic people in the 200-250 players on the game , which if a new player asks for help , chips or anything their met with normally very toxic comments or banishment right away , which leads them to become trolls and further cause issue to the game itself , which could be avoided easily if the CA would properly enforce the correct rules . - Public banishments , now this is pretty disgusting aswell .. when a player is banned publicly they have rules which state don 't Messages solely for the purpose of angering other players or trying to cause a reaction in chat .. and each time someone is banned this is normally violated even by some CA , so again .. broken rule structure . - Theres lots more to be said however if you decide to try this game .. you should know what your getting into , as its going to be 50/50 if you like it or not , most would say to use ignore function , however you still see the damage being dealt daily and I mean almost every single day theres drama or some type of issue started and lingers for days , watch out for back-seat moderators too , they will spark more drama and basically bait you into banishment . Now again this is called CasinoRPG which means its a multiplayer game and having to disable your chat , basically makes it a single player game ruining the entire purpose of a multiplayer RPG . Here are a list of the official rules incase you decide to try this game out - <url> I can no longer recommend this game for people to play , I am normally very silent on the game , only speak out on things when I see people being wronged or mistreated , then I get met with resistance and bullied aswell , so again its very hard for me to recommend this to new players when they have little chance to enjoy this game and may very well turn into a troll themselves .
13094,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sid1120/recommended/367520,sid1120,367520,EDIT , AFTER PLAYING 20 hours : - This might well be one of my favorite games ever made . It 's currently the best Metroidvania I ever played . I was only miffed 2 times : - When I lost 5000 $ by running into suspicious room and find myself in a boss fight . - When purposefully made a detour to go visit a character I loved , only to realize she 's dead / mad . That was a real bummer . I haven 't finished the game yet , so I 'm still clinging to the hope that there 's a way to save her . I also stopped killing a bunch of enemies that look like her , so that 's slightly annoying ... ORIGINAL REVIEW : In short : this game is amazing . I don 't think that I 'm adding anything new to the already thousands of positive reviews . You roam around with a great feeling of exploration and mystery . The somewhat open-nature of the map gives you the feeling that you 're making your own pathing decisions . Truly what a Metroidvania should feel like . The combat is also very enjoyable and it 's not frustratingly hard (or even that hard actually ). And the characters met along the way are very enjoyable and funny , despite their lack of depth .

So many plot twists to discuss , so many different spells and powers to decide which was the strongest , so many polygon anime girls to decide who was your Waifu For Laifu ¡­ Summarizing : there 's a huge part of my life trapped inside this game , and when I start to think about it , the memories start to bring all that childhood time back to life . Plot The plot begins simple : you are Cloud , an ex-high rank military now working as a mercenary for the terrorist group Avalanche . Your objective is to stop the planet from dying by the constant extraction of its life force . Later , you will find yourself withing a web of lies and cospiracy surrouding the existence of ancient godlike creatures known as ¡°the Ancients ¡± and you will meet Sephiroth , who seems to be some godlike creature who is the key for all the events that are leading this planet to its ultimate destruction . Cloud shares a commom past with Sephiroth , a past that is still unclear and yet to be revealed . Later on in the game , you will have to run against time in order to stop a huge meteor from hitting the Earth and destroy everything you know and love . Gameplay Gameplay follows the classic JRPG formula : it 's a turn based RPG where each character has to wait for its turn to act . By acting , you can attack , use a spell , use an item , among other choises . As your party defeat monsters and enemies , you level up , improving your character and granting them new abilities such as limitbreakers and such . Exploring the vast world will give you more powerful and secret items or spells and will also shed light on the main story plot . This game is simply TIMELESS and the best Final Fantasy game ever made , when you think about ¡°Final Fantasy ¡±, FFVII should be the first to come to your mind ! I Rate it 5.0/5.0 ¨C absolutely flawless !

Not fun or challenging or possible to engage with sincerely . Long version : early in the first ep , during what you might call the tutorial , you are asked to choose between two versions of the truth : that a crime suspect was released and case closed because of A ) lack of evidence or B ) bribes . You are given no context for this choice other than a news article stating that the official version is A but some people think it might be B . I 'm not exaggerating . All you have to go on is the word of a journalist you don 't know , reporting the words of other people you don 't know regarding an incident you just heard of . Even so the game stresses that anything you report will be taken as The Truth and there will be no possibility to undo the choice .

The lack of handholding in figuring out how best to manage your resources is one of the joys (or pains ) of the game .

Awesome production value , great mechanics , beautiful lore , but the game is built around a single purpose , to dump money into it . Everything requires payment , including the competitive mode , and as of now , there 's no ladders , rankings or a progression system , not even achievements , imagine that . If you 're not planning to dump hundreds of euros on a digital card game , steer away from it . Valve is a real dissapointment these days , they 've lost touch with their crowd , no longer a fan .

13136,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ki11sone/recommended/488790,Ki11sone,488790,This game is amazing . I absolutely love it . I didn 't care for the first game all that much because it was too slow , but despite that I finished it and enjoyed the story . This game however is leagues better than the first game and it fixes pretty much every issue I had with the first game . If you love South Park or even remotely liked the first game then you will greatly enjoy the Fractured But Whole . Despite what others say . You can play the game and unlock Steam Achievements just fine , even with Uplay in the background . It is even nice as well as Uplay gives you free items and lets you earn points through achievements to unlock the Assassins Creed outfit . It 's no big thing as the costumes in this game don 't count towards abilities or stats like the first game did so you can make you character look as cool as you want and the Assassins Creed Outfit is indeed cool . As for the Day One DLC it is just outfits from the first game as a throwback . It should have at least been Pre-Order DLC and then purchasable afterward or at least given to those who own the first game , but it is what it is . They are just costumes and that is it . They don 't change gameplay or give any perks for wearing them . The fact people are down voting the game based on that just shows how pity and childish they are . Getting mad over a costume instead of focusing on the gameplay . Despite all that I hope you give the game a chance . It is amazingly fun and one I plan on beating (Which is rare for me ) and I am even thinking about picking up the Season Pass just because I want to play the Story DLC that they will eventually release .
13137,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ddrcdt/recommended/10270,ddrcdt,10270,The Disciples series is one of the most beautiful underrated franchise in gaming strategy . It is the same genre as the classic Heroes of Might and Magic , and it has become a sort of " cult classic " ever since the massive success of Disciples II . This third entry follows that tradition , by keeping a beautiful , dark , artwork , combined with unforgiving mechanics and an enticing world / factions . However , Disciples 3 was a complete wreck at launch , laden with game breaking bugs and suffering with inferior mechanics to it 's predecessor . The " Reincarnation " version of the game , the one I 'm reviewing , is definitely a more polished version of Disciples 3 " Gold " (the vanilla + ressurection expansion ). This , sadly , does not mean the game was completely overhauled in it 's faults , but simply that all of it 's game breaking bugs were fixed and some balancing issues were addressed . Overrall , Disciples 3 : Reincarnation is a good game which follows a strong tradition laid by the classic Disciples II . However , it is still , at it 's best , an unpolished gem , very rough in the edges . That means people with low tolerance to lack of polish will not enjoy this game , and people new to the series fare better to begin their immersion in the Disciples world with the predecessors games . However , if you are a fan of the HOMM-like strategy genre , you will definitely like this game , which is by itself worth your money in any sale , as unpolished as it may be .

13147,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ApocalypticFoxx/recommended/3720,ApocalypticFoxx,3720,First of all , I love this game . Of course it has its limitations , its bugs , its crashes , but I myself rarely experienced any of the second two and the only limitation I found was the minion count which can be easily increased with a simple change to a single file . That being said , there is one mistake I made that anyone else should be careful not to do that I will come to later . Personally I find this game perfectly matches everything you would desire in a real-time strategy game from the early 2000 era - matches it even more so than any of the more modern titles . It 's clever , it 's creative and as you progress it can become really challenging ; forcing you to focus and really make the most of the strategic gameplay design - I myself would consider it an icon (not to mention my adoration of the way they handle the premise twist itself of being the bad guy instead of the usual hero routine ). However I mentioned having a 'What Not To Do ' piece of advice for anyone looking to play this game and that would be ; Do Not have only one save file . I know for many this is a 'noob'ish mistake but for people like me (with OCD that makes them hate such things as save file clutter and even delete autosaves after a period of time ) I 'm simply saying try your best NOT to do this . As I said the game IS buggy and unfortunately there is a certain Research related bug 20-30 hours into the game that in the end corrupted my save file which is now unloadable . I accept having only a single save file is my own error of course and as I understand it , this Research Bug is a common but usually easily fixable problem - I just had bad luck . But other than that I failed to find any real issues or game breaking bugs that took me either out of the gameplay or made the game unplayable , it was just the one . So Yes , I would entirely recommend this game .

By cheap I mean not the price only but execution and the way it feels overall . It isn 't the worst game out there , for sure , but I can 't come up with the reason to play this instead of the other superior puzzle games . I call puzzle-platformers my favorite genre . This game tends to be more of a puzzle one rather a platformer (I judge by my ~ 1 hour of playtime ). Which better alternatives can I recommend you ? The closest in terms of game mechanics are And Yet It Moves (2009), VVVVVV (2010) and FEZ (2013). Didn 't play the first one and it 's the most arguable recommendation in this short list but VVVVVV and FEZ are absolute masterpieces ! Go play them instead of MINDCUBES . The last thing I 'd like to say is the number of achievements . **ck you who exploits this ****ty <cheap game + tons of achievements > model . MINDCUBES has 3 achievements per each level resulting in a total of 315. Not thousands of them but still way too many . The Final Words There are far better games out there so go play them instead . Your time is too precious to spend it on mediocrity . VVVVVV and FEZ are my recommendations . P .S.

I actually did enjoy playing the game but it has some pretty significant problems . Towards the end of runs enemies become heavily resistance towards specific kinds of attacks , ballistic , fire or shock . All enemies in the last section (1/3 of the levels in the game mind you ) have heavy reistance to two of them and heavy weakness to one of them . Long story short , if you have all three elements (not a particularly common occurance ) then you can pokemon matchup your weapons to their type and breeze through . If you are missing one or two elements some enemies are going to take about 6 more combos than normal and about 4 more than they should . The game also isn 't that difficult , but because of the risistance thing combined with the characters sparatic , hard to control movement , and random dungeon generation making for lengthy levels , it makes runs in this game take a long time . There is also little to no tention the whole way . Oh it also does the thing many other rogue likes do where health pickups are few and far between so an early {?} up bleeds you dry for the rest of the game , given you actually do have dificulty in this game (as I did at the start ). Not saying that is a bad thing , but some people will be annoied about it .

If so , you are soundly in this game 's demographic . This game isn 't just a 2D Metroidvania , it IS Symphony of the Night . The creators have gone to extraordinary lengths to re-create the visual style , the sound effects and gameplay quirks of the classic Castlevania game . But it wouldn 't be fair to just say this game is just Symphony of the Night with time travel . The game strives to expand on what made SOTN so appealing , and create something that stands on its own . Your main character in Timespinner is a mage archetype . Instead of swinging swords and whips , you wield floating magic orbs and spells . The orbs are your only melee weapon , usually flying out to hit enemies directly in front of you , but you steadily aquire more orbs with unique properties . Like a orb that turns into a large sword as it strikes , another as a giant hammer , another that creates AOE bursts around you , and another that drains your 'aura' guage to hit foes with homing lightning bolts . Each orb also helps unlock a new spell , which uses your aura to produce all kinds projectiles , defensive barriers , or buffs . Most uniquely , and tied to the time travel mechanic , is our heroine 's ability to freeze time , giving you a few precious seconds to avoid a deadily attack or close in to strike weak points . Aura regenerates over time , and the sand needed for time-stopping is gained by defeating enemies . The game 's layout is fun to explore , and each area has unique and beautiful aesthetic . The map is split into past and present versions , with enough variation that it never feels like a copy and paste of the same levels . The progress of upgrades to get you past obsticles and new orbs and spells is generious , and I did not need to go to the internet to find out how to progress very often . Gameplay wise , my only complaint is the difficulty . Timespinner also borrows from SOTN 's easy difficulty , so I highly recommend harder difficulties if available . And many of the melee orbs you find are simply variations of the short-range , rapid strikes present on the first orbs you get . And while you can individualy level up each orb (which in turn levels up the spell associated with it ), often your high-level orb is outclassed by the fresh , level 1 orb you just found that does the same thing , and faster . The story is decent . Not great , but the creators tried to tell a good story , and they occassionally nail some of the beats . But cliches are still rampant , and the time travel aspect is under-used , despite being the central theme . There are few characters to bounce off our heroine and develope her personality . Most of the NPCs occupy one space in one time period and exist solely to give you fetch quests and talk about their sexual preferences . I still highly recommend Timespinner , despite its flaws . It you wish to play a new SOTN , this will sate your desires quite well . It does Metroidvania right , and I really want to see developers do more like it .

13178,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pauleku/recommended/367520,pauleku,367520,#BEATEN (Switch) 4 hours - PC 50 hours - Switch Stuffed with goodness Hollow Knight is one of the best gated platformers / " metroidvania " games ever made . A game that draws from the formentioned gated platformers and also from other places . Dark souls is another one i liken it to in terms of death and experience / money loss and understanding the enemies by trial and error . Pros : - Wonderful hand drawn art and animation - Fantastic world building - Great use of npcs to tell story and develop character - TONS of optional areas , secrets , and things to discover - A great sense of progression . Upgrades , items , and skills all feel useful and the slow drip is just right . - Slotted trinkets to add modifiers to abilities so you can sorta class build . - Great music - Its 15 bucks new Cons : - None - Switch version has some slowdown in one specific area . Not a problem on pc , as you migth expect . Neutral : - Can be very difficult in terms of precision platforming , dying to new enemies , or bosses . Especially the bosses .
13179,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mosaix123/recommended/212680,mosaix123,212680,Think of all the pain you have had from dying in a game . Think about all the times bad luck searched you out in order to mess you up . This is the game that glorifies that feeling . You will die , It will hurt . But you will always come back knowing this is one of the best ways to spend your time .
13180,https://steamcommunity.com/id/partisan_a/recommended/250760,partisan_a,250760,It 's an amazing game ! First of all , it has a remarkable atmosphere and many humorous elements , e .g. main hero 's weapon , map which parodies one of Super Mario games map , having a fishing rod (pretty useful btw ). Levels feature great variety of mechanics , enemies and platforming . Each level has its own style with fitting graphics , platforming and bosses . Also , each level hold several secrets , which often require precise platrorming to clear them . You can collect special relics with special abilities , and practically all of them become handy in some situations . There are also various upgrades , helping a lot with game completion . The game also balances the difficulty by allowing to complete previous levels for more gold and get more upgrades , if you cannot pass some level . The difficulty curve is very good . First levels are pretty easy and don 't have difficult mechanics . Bosses there have low hp . As the game progresses , some levels introduce new mechanics , required for their completion . Platforming gets more difficult and bosses gets more hp . In last levels you sometimes have to successfully use several mechanics to pass them . The only minor complaint to level design is having some rather long segments where there are precise parts at the end , where you can fall or get thrown into a pit . Completing easy first part of the save over and over gets annoying sometimes . Though in general , the game is pretty forgiving to deaths . You only loose a part of your gold , which can be fully returned if you successfully reach the place where you died and collect it . Some segments are pretty hard , so be ready to loose gold there . Thus , I 'd always recommended to spend money before starting the next level . The game also has a lot of extra content : game plus , challenges , playing as Plague Knight . Overall , I definitely recommend it even if you don 't regularly play platformers . My overall mark is 9/10. I won 't give 10 since level design is not perfect , though it 's generally very good .

The controls are almost perfect for a wrestling game and it has a good amount of wrestlers , gimmicks and moves . The menus and the loading of matches are quick . There are a lot of match types missing and the responsiveness when you grapple someone on the ground could be improved , but any imperfections and missing features can easily be chalked up to it being on a new engine and written from scratch . I 'm just hoping they carry over all the moves , arenas , match types and outfits , etc . from this game to the next . Something THQ never had the balls to do , for some reason .

Combat is intense , artstyle is amazing , and the soundtrack is slaping . It 's the Hereditary or My Hero Academia of Rougelites : It 's not something particularly groundbreaking , it 's just a solid example of the genre (this is how you do a comparison , Polygon . Not everything is f ***ing Dark Souls ).
13198,https://steamcommunity.com/id/indigoviking/recommended/476600,indigoviking,476600,Update : If you want cancer , buy this game and play multiplayer . This is a prime example of a AAA company putting out a less than optimal game . I bought this for the Multiplayer because let 's be honest here , the campaign is short and dull and lacks any real emotion . What they lack with story telling they try and grip you with dramatic QTE and pointless blood and gore . It 's empty . To be honest I got to the 2nd chapter out of 6 and it was by far the most pointless campaign . The multiplayer on the otherhand is just as bad . It 's 2017 going on 2018 and they release the multiplayer running on P2P . It 's a laggy , horrible mess full of desync and moments of " WHY AREN 'T YOU DYING ?!?!" when you load a player with 4-6 rounds and they still run around and bunny hop like it 's no big deal . It 's horrible . People kill you with melee and you never see them swing that shovel to one shot you in the first place . It 's just them running into you and you die . I miss the MW2 days and I thought this would bring some of that back but it 's so far from it . COD lost me as a fan after Black Ops and MW3. I guess it 's safe to say I will never be coming back to a COD game . I refunded this piece of garbage and I hope you all spare yourselves and just avoid buying this game . Back to playing BF4 and BF1 I guess .
13199,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197987527539/recommended/418240,76561197987527539,418240,I would recommend this game at the very least due to genre draught . There aren 't a lot of squad tactics games available , especially set in medieval Japan , so there 's precious little chance to be picky . Good : It has good graphics , satisfying dialogue and music , and it feels really great when a plan comes together . Solving a puzzle after 10-15 reloads can be cathartic . Bad : Despite the entire squad and tactical part , the game is very limited in options . For example , only one character out of five is able to throw rocks do distract enemies (which doesn 't really sound like a secret ninja art taught to select few ) and quite often chaining commands between two or three characters becomes extremely hard (you can only queue one command ) as there 's no tactical pause whatsoever (this is where I wished the game had multiplayer ). Many problems in the game seem to have a fixed solution intended by the developers , so you have to either find that one solution or employ slow cheap tactics to grind down the enemy forces . WIth a full stealth approach you might be looking at around 2 hours of trial and error per mission . With a devil may care attitude the missions can be rushed in 15-20 minutes . Both approaches work but there is hardly any middle ground .

The racing itself is still entertaining , though the physics and car handling does feels dated compared to modern arcade racers . The 'Ultimate Box ' is not that ultimate as online racing does not work and there seems to be dlc content missing , but other than that it is still a fully playable single player game . The game basically plays like GTA Online racing , but then without visible checkpoints . All races are point to point races where you have to find the shortest route to the finish by looking on the mini-map . The lack of checkpoints is the only challenging aspect of the game . I often end up pausing the game and opening the map to find the best route , because the mini-map lacks the sense of overview and direction . The whole time that I was playing I was thinking in the back of my head 'I could just as well be playing GTA ', but at least this game does not have 2 minute long loading screens , bad matchmaking lobbies and idiot players that can 't drive :) Buy it only when it 's on sale .

13210,https://steamcommunity.com/id/superbalkanman/recommended/311560,superbalkanman,311560,Assassin 's Creed Rogue is the definition of Exploration and Adventure ! I really like both Black Flag and Rogue because of the sea / ocean exploration with a ship . Now for Rogue : Story : Interesting ! I also like the fact that it fills the gaps of (Inside Animus of course ) AC 3 's story . You understand the origins of certain characters from from AC 3 , how they came to be the person they were in that game and etc . Side Quests : Quite interesting . I was quite surprised that you can unlock some of the outfits and weapons (via side quests ) early in the game , and by early i mean you don 't have to finish the 4-5th sequence of the game to get it like previous installments (altohugh that can actually make you more interested into the game , you want to unlock that certain weapon or outfit , argh and you want it bad :D). I am not going to get into too much details about the game mechanics , it is quite similar to Black Flag in relation to climbing , sail around with the ship and etc . There was only a slight issue regarding the runing and jumping / climbing , it seemed to me that Shay couldn 't climb or jump the right spot (for example , he couldn 't climb certain tree , although he can do that if you jump down and climb it again ), but that is just a very minor issue . The Big Picture : Game runs smoothly ! No FPS drops (at least not for me ), good graphics , yeah some people may not find them spectacular , but for me they are cool ! I mentioned the outfits , I find them amazing . Quite different from the other AC games . I managed to unlock all of them except one , because I finished the game and I started playing other stuff , but I am planning on unlocking it , because it looks interesting . The end of the game is also very interesting . It really connects well with the beginning of the next AC game . All in all , great game . 10/10 would play it again ! So if you wonder whether to give it a chance or not , I would say yes !

13215,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ZebraNation/recommended/456670,ZebraNation,456670,I 'd say this is one of the finest games of its genre but ...It doesn 't really have a specific genre . It 's like Talisman , D &D and Rhythm Combat all rolled up into one and the only other game like this is this game 's predecessor . As a huge fan of the fantasy genre , and boardgame video games the likes of Talisman and Witcher boardgame , this game was amazing for me . It has vastly superior graphics to the original , and improved on all the flaws of it (namely a very clunky feeling to the combat ) and everything else about it is update as well . The graphics are great , the soundtrack is typical fantasy fair , the replayability is off the charts especially once they finally add endless mode and the controls are pretty standard and easy to grasp . For boardgame lovers and fantasy lovers , this is a must for your library .

They fixed some of the glaring problems , and *shrug* I like the game . Hope they do more updates soon . The game is quite interesting . I would recommend it if it didn 't have such huge problems . But right now I can 't do it , not in the current form . The game has some serious problems . I know this is " early access " , but that doesn 't excuse everything . Biggest issues : 1. Some combat bugs . When you quit to the menu and go back into the game , the battle replays , and the results are DIFFERENT . Suddenly you don 't take tons of damage , and you now have way more HP . This is just a replay , there should be no change in your HP , however the result is totally different . In the replay , things probably played correctly , or totally differently , either of which is bad . (Have not seen many combat problems anymore ) 2. Card abilities are not explained . You basically have to use a card , to see what it actually does . The descriptions are that bad . I have gotten used to the descriptions and symbols now , but some cards still make no sense . (EDIT: Now there is a " training mode " that teaches you the meaning of some of the symbols ) 3. Storyline is gibberish . It is not even worth reading . :( I finished all the 5 " story mode " chapters . I read all the text . What do I know about the story ? Nothing . It is about 3 characters in different places , doing stuff , and yea , that 's it . 3. " Standard " plays totally different than " Story " mode . Why change how turns work ? That 's just really weird . In Standard mode , turns are so short initially , that you can 't even call them turns , your turns overlap with the enemy turns . It makes for very messy gameplay early on . 4. Some enemy cards resolve so fast that you can 't tell what happened . How did the enemy get 70 shield ? I have no idea . Probably a bug , but who knows , it all happened too fast . (EDIT: You can now see the card history at the top of the screen ) 5. Many " builds " you can make , play in nearly the exact same pattern for every fight . This makes most fights boring . For example , I had a Rampage deck when doing one of the campaign parts , and I played the same 3 cards to start every battle , and that did something like 50 damage on turn 1 , so almost every enemy died . The ones that didn 't die , i finished on 2nd turn . Used the same pattern of cards every battle . Some builds can be more interesting than this , and you might have to think a good amount , but many builds require almost no brainpower to play .

Travel across space at the speed of plot and learn about the society of The Mugunghwa , a ship that was destroyed by a mudering psychopath . Most people playing this are VN connoisseurs anyway , so I 'll just get to it . There are three paths , one only accessible via a save from the first game . One has *Mute: a girl of perfection , one has *Hyun-Ae: a girl with the personality of sliced bread , and one has both girls working with the nameless , optional gendered protagonist . Each story involves *Mute and / or *Hyun-Ae learning more about the ship 's past and coming to terms with how their life has progressed . You know , that real deep stuff . Like baking some cake . That being said , gameplay wise : If you know how to read , you are pretty much in the clear . It is preferred that you should like reading if you want to play this game . Because there is a lot of that . It 's the whole game . Music 's aight , really good to set the mood for the settings . It gets raunchy , like a lot . So maybe not let someone under 18 play this ? In the same vein , prep for a lotta gay stuff if that irks ya . I thought the stories were cute . The stories also involve a lot of political corruption and government mindgames . Every lawmaker should play this , it gets hotter than the sex stories . It 's every lobbyist 's wet dream . Even though I finished most of it , I just can 't play it anymore . I finished *Mute's route and it messed with me a bit too much personally . Lastly , if you are reading this for info about THAT achievement , you 're too young to play this game .

Story : Honestly , I cant give a huge amount of info here . Not because the story isnt good , but rather most of my time has been spent just messing around and ignoring the story . What story is there is interesting enough , but it largely window dressing for the sandbox game you came for . Combat : Very similar if not basically the same as before . Batman-style combat with counters , metered " super " abilities , a stealth system , and upgrades which each have 3 sub-upgrades . It works very well . No complaints . The Nemesis System Its back , and at least early on is largely the same as before . I am not really far enough to give impressions on the later tiers of this because i havent unlocked it yet . I havent even unlocked the dominate ability , as the is story-based . I do know you can send dominated characters out to kill nemesis . But I havent gotten there . MIcrotransations Have been 100% removed . Dont sweat it . Overall Its the same game but with more . A fun game to just dive into and mess around and enjoy the emergent stories .

13231,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stayinside4ever/recommended/413150,stayinside4ever,413150,all i think i need to say is that i have 149 hours on this game and that 's considered a tiny amount in this game 's community . i also had played it for months before i bought it (didn't have money at the time , so i pirated it ), so the 149 hours is only a fraction of how long i have actually played it for . 10/10 would recommend to anyone

13235,https://steamcommunity.com/id/liroku/recommended/571630,liroku,571630,Extremely buggy , multiplayer is barely working , the puzzles aren 't very difficult IMO , and the game hasn 't been updated in about a year . It 's a cool concept , but it 's a very short barebones game with no support or updates happening . Just skip right over this , unless you happen upon it for free somehow .

It is a side scrolling adventure game with an interesting ghost story and good atmosphere . Gameplay is light to be sure , casual even . This is not a game to be played in search of mind-bending puzzles or complex actions . Yet , I think it 's its simplicity , even naivety which made Whispering Willows work for me . It allowed my mind to focus on exploration and story-telling , to take in the atmosphere and enjoy the journey .

You can always replay levels for a better time or score , and it comes with extra levels and every secret is paired with an unlock art piece , which are well worth the effort of unlocking . Extremely difficult but very rewarding when you pull off a complicated combo or beat the time limit of a difficult level . A ++

The game has a lot of well fleshed out gamemacanics and feels really unique , but still has a lot of bugs has to fix . The beginning of the game is now the most fun part and definatly the most well developed . Later in the game , money is a bit flying your way , which reduces the challange at that point . Also in the last levels , bottle necks accure when you want to make multiple video 's at the same time on a console (which is everything that is not played on a pc ), because only one of these video 's can be recorded at the time . Also my wife is constantly playing on my stuff and blocks my collaborators from working ! :@ Never should have married . If the developers keep working , I am going to play a lot more hours !

13252,https://steamcommunity.com/id/beefchops/recommended/555160,beefchops,555160,Recommend with some caveats , if you are newer to VR and haven 't found your " legs " yet then you may not be ready for the patience required to eventually move without feeling motion sickness . Standing still while smoothly (not teleporting ) moving will do this in just about any game it seems , and in an often frenetic shooter like this it 'd be a rougher start than your body " learning " it through , say , Vivecraft . I think I 'll likely pick it up again later once I 'm closer to being able to handle it .

13255,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zombiecat1/recommended/379720,zombiecat1,379720,An amazing FPS with a focus on quick and seamless slaughtering of demons . Its a very satisfying game with an amazing soundtrack to get you into the mood of slaying your demons cause when aren 't you in the mood for slaying demons ? Its also very well optimised ..I get framerates between 150-200 (GTX 1070 ) on average ..with 200 being the limit . Its smooth and definitely a pc game you should consider picking up as it goes on sale regularly for 15-20 euro . If your thinking of a good single player campaign game ..this game is definitely for you ..although there is multiplayer ..this game is definitely more focused on delivering a good single player experience and it does whole heartedly . If you are still are not convinced , mick gordon has the entire doom soundtrack on spotify and youtube ..just take a listen and it 'll suck you in to the doom universe and before you know it , you 'l be wielding a super shotgun and on your merry way blasting demons back to hell ..or if your in hell ...where? Anyway , very highly recommended ..there is also a free demo to try out if you want to see if your potato can handle the doom game .

13264,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mramazing3/recommended/302610,mramazing3,302610,(Writing this with over 10 hours on non-steam version .) This game is a great little time killer and has a rather large replay variety due to the 18 stages and three different characters . All the stages are different and it really tests and (for me personally ) helps build things like twitch reflexes and timing because , you just can 't take your eyes off the screen or else you 'll definitely fail . 10/10 Would science again
13265,https://steamcommunity.com/id/paleandor/recommended/398850,paleandor,398850,Story , RPG , typing game where you follow a girl on a fox . It was my first experience with this type of game but I was really great surprised . Overview This game is challenging typing game in some sort of way for example : you need to switch between your powers - " multitasking " - fast and correct writing is important because if you failed you will die . You can also play this game in many languages : English , French , German , Spanish , Polish , Portuguese-Brazil , Russian , Czech , Japanes and Simplified Chinese . That 's another plus right there . Also soundtrack is amazing . For a visual site I can 't say anything bad because this game is wonderful . Great puzzles . Upgrading system By killing monsters and destroing nearby momuments etc . you get points to upgrade your girl . Achievements You can get all of the achievements by playing this game - 7 hours total +- (some achievements are like : type a certain amount of words and kill certain amounts of enemies which is not bad ). Overall This game is isn 't for a " slow people " or for people who still have to look down at their keyboard to type each word . If you enjoy typing Epistory - Typing Chronicles is game for you . Go for it !
13266,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mokky/recommended/481510,Mokky,481510,its a nice game . only problem i have with it is those dream stages that are massive and the movement speed is pretty slow .
13267,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Thomasasia/recommended/356190,Thomasasia,356190,Dispite a few minor flaws , this game is fantastic . The graphics , audio , and gameplay are all very high quality . The player forges their own story , with unique enemies and allies , in a world shaped by the player 's decisions . There are 5 maps for the player to explore and fight in , which is a large improvement for the 2 maps of the last game . While there are loot boxes , you recieve many for free or for completing missions , specifically in the " Vendetta Missions " where you avenge another player by killing the captain who killed them . Loot boxes are not forced upon you in any way , and I really don 't understand why everyone is complaining about them . The claims that it is almost impossible to complete the final act without them are complete BS , as I 'm having no trouble beating it at max difficulty . My only major criticism for this game is the difficulty , as I have not found the highest difficulty to be very hard , though it is still considerably more diffucult than both normal difficulty and the difficulty of Shadow of Mordor . It may just be that I am good at this game . I have had a lot of fun playing this , and it has been both a game and an experience to me . It saddens me that so many people are upset over the microtransactions because I really feel like this is the best game of 2017. Overall rating : 9.5/10

You start every level with a new prisoner with who you can choose new stats . Those stats you 'll improve during a dungeon , in each level are 6 chest hidden which let you choose to upgrade a stat . The story is a bit thin but fun and with a lot of humor . The gameplay feels a bit clucky , your char moves kind of slow and the fighting has already a high difficulty level on the " normal " dificulty . With practice you 'll get better at the fightning system but for me it still was a challenge . The most annoying this is that when you use a save inside a dungeon all mobs will respawn , so sometimes it is better to not save yet . Info achievements : This game will be a real challenge to complete , because you need to complete it on the highest difficulty . there are 5 difficulty levels and the first one is already a challenge , I don 't want to know how hard the last one is . If you 're up for a challenge this is the game for you ! Other achievements are for beat the different levels , use different weapons and beat levels with maxing a stat and not using a stat . Pros & Cons : + A game with humor + Challenging but fun gameplay - When saving in a dungeon all monsters respawn .

Incredibly rewarding , always challenging and wonderfully crafted . A game that combines elements of rogue-likes with metrovania 's exploration and rewards . You will likely die , a lot , but in doing so you will learn to survive and over time power up your hero with new items and passive upgrades . You will need to balance many risk and reward situations to find your victory . The game will offer you many playstyles over time and I am certain you will find one that suits your fun , with many options to experiment . The art style of the game is striking , taking the retro look and going to gorgeous new levels . During your trek through the world the action may get frantic , yet the visuals will allow you to easily keep track of the happening and allow you to do those all important dodges . This game is also amazing for streaming as the Twitch integration will delight your viewers in many ways and they 're configurable to your preferance . To be honest , it is really hard for me to find something negative to say about this game . I guess one thing that goes against the game is that it may slowly get a little repetitive and sometimes the items you get will not be all that great . If you can look past this , you will find a wonderful game that keeps rewarding skill and persistence . In conclusion : Yes , get this . Play this .

" Someone " started playing and thought the aim was to kill the people hanging and promptly let fly as many arrows as they could into the hanging " targets " . " Someone " .

13293,https://steamcommunity.com/id/eladdon/recommended/427760,eladdon,427760,No spoilers here . If you were raised in an environment of logic , reason and evidence , then you 're not going to get much out of this game . If you were raised in a superstitious religious environment or you had bad parents resulting in you being easily emotionally manipulated then my condolences and your consolation prize is this game . As far as game play goes , there 's nothing particularly challenging and no real puzzles . Mostly you 're just a courier for items or trying to figure out what the game mechanics are . You also spend a good chunk of time just waiting . If you 're easily emotionally manipulated maybe the sounds will provide some suspense , but it didn 't do anything for me . The rest of the game was mostly an appeal to Catholic mysticism along with their myth of ghosts , which again I suppose appeals to weak minded superstitious people . As someone who didn 't suffer psychological abuse as a child from religious parents , there simply was no scare factor for me . The only thing I 'm afraid of when walking into a dark room is stepping on lego . Even the 'jump scares ' were to me the equivalent of Rick jumping out and saying " Morty , come on , you got to come with me , I got a surprise for you Morty " , it just resulted in me laughing . Sorry , just being honest . To put the subject of scariness in perspective , I DID however find Resident Evil Biohazard scary . Maybe because I found the story slightly more believable .

Rocksmith 2014 Also Includes Mini-games that Help memorize Chords and String Skipping Techniques etc . You can Play any song You want on Rocksmith 2014 and on Non Stop play you just play the song and Practice with the riff repeater if you want .

Score attack is the same thing except if you miss to many notes or chords you will get strikes and on the third Strike the song will stop and it will Say you failed the song . You get scored on everything you do on Rocksmith except session mode and Non stop play and can beat your high score or Compete on the leaderboards .

13328,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bennybaconburger/recommended/1510,bennybaconburger,1510,This game is absolutley fantastic . This is a company that I have never been disapointed with . Probably because they are not some out of touch developers sitting in a corporate office that have to kiss the feet of some board execs .

13329,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PratzStrike/recommended/531640,PratzStrike,531640,So this is old school creature-based Magic the Gathering , only with abilities and cards you could only do on a computer . Like 'put this card somewhere within your top 10 cards ' or 'pull every Yeti in your deck one card closer to the top ' or 'add +1/+1 to the top unit or weapon in your deck '. It plays fast and excellent and I 've not spent a penny on it yet , but I find myself logging in every day to run through a couple casual games to get a free card pack and clear out my daily quest . Best thing , it 's on your smartphone too . It 's Hearthstone , only not complete {?} Get it .
13330,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rayonixez/recommended/237930,rayonixez,237930,Game had its flaws for sure . I realised after that the story is what pulled me through it , and I was hooked on the story . When I finished the game I realised that I had no desire to replay it , as the mechanics themselves were okay at best . The mechanics is what you can change in more play throughs by using different skills etc , but I found myself having no desire to do so . With that being said , I would still recommend this game as the first playthrough was a single sit down session . I enjoyed it that much . Great story , music , and art , good enough gameplay to move along the story

If you want a fancier VR experienc : Archangel has better graphics . If you want a full Mech experience : Mechwarrior Online or Mechwarrior 4 Mercs (Mektek) as you covered . The original Mechwarrior series has much better voice acting compared to the cringe inducing Archangel and War Robots VR . War Robots VR feels like a teaser for the mobile game , but make no mistake ; the full War Robots game on mobile devices remain to be pay-to-win .

13333,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jebgaming/recommended/108600,jebgaming,108600,Even after all these years of development there is not much to do in the game . After 7 ingame days for example you 've pretty much seen the meat of the game 's mechanics and it becomes very repetitive . The game plays like an application with context menu 's, not very intuitive . Right click somewhere , a dropdown / context menu appears . That 's pretty much 80% of the game right there . Everything you do is done through the context menu and the floaty inventory / environment boxes . It just feels off and repetitive . Once your settled down in the game , built this crazy fortress , it turns into an inventory management game . The undead aren 't really a danger anymore even on the hardest settings . Also I find that even on rare loot settings it 's still really easy to hoard crazy amounts of food example given . At that point you don 't have to go on runs anymore and your just wondering what to do next , even with mods . Your at that point just right clicking food items , consuming them and reading books to keep your mood up . What is the point ? There is no endgame . There is no reason to keep playing . Why would I want to survive for hundreds of ingame days e .g. if there is no reward , nothing to do ? I strongly feel like the developers haven 't thought enough of keeping the player entertained and engaged , but focused almost solely on building a semi accurate simulator . If you want to grow your own crops for example you 'll have to do this by running repetitively through a bunch of menu items , and then you have to wait for weeks of ingame time before you can harvest , during which there is nothing that is not repetitive to do . Most mechanics don 't line up in terms of engagement , actions & tasks are repetitive and there is no end game or a reason to go on . Why work a crazy amount of time on pretty animations (next update ), pretty weather or pretty water whilst the game isn 't med-longterm fun ? I wish they would put a lot of focus on fun . It 's a game after all .

13336,https://steamcommunity.com/id/manicado/recommended/605740,manicado,605740,<url> The base is there for an amazing experience , sadly the game is not done enough . It 's simply too early to be put on Early Access . This game is like pre-early access . I know people will hate me for this review , but there 's not a lot of content at all . There are so many bugs and it 's really a stretch to play it after 30 minutes . The price is extremely high for what it is too . The developer should have maybe ran an open beta instead of trying to cash in already . I also dislike how the trailer makes the game seem even better than it actually is . I really wanted to love this game , I really wanted it to be great but at this current moment in time , it 's still WAY too early . That 's not to say I won 't be updating this review in 6-9 months time when there 's some more content . I really just can 't recommend this in the state it 's currently in .

I was sold on this being a Souls-like for Multi-player by a friend that has the first game . What it is , is an exercise in your patience with annoying and unpredictable controls , AI and agravating AF music . Visually its alright . Controls are resposive .

Many have given up and journeyed on .... I really like this game . Maybe not what it is now but it 's like an ex that you can 't figure out why the relationship failed and you keep trying but you realize it 's not you ... They changed and maybe they 'll never be what you need again . Maybe you can even argue they changed for the objectively worse ... But late at night , you think about them and you go to click the name and you instead think " well , better not ." Then you call your friend fortnite , becuase even though they are kinda loud sometimes and maybe they have quirks you don 't really like ... They are stable and consistent and mentally healthy . Also , you can bet they aren 't going to constantly let you down . RR just can 't and it would take a lot to re instate the faith once had in it by many . I hope one day to change this review . Maybe more than in any game .
13347,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AgatoNtB/recommended/211420,AgatoNtB,211420,One of the most intimidating games that i played so far . Dark Souls is an interesting game that its praised for its difficulty , but thats what makes it a great game , since overcoming those obstacles that the game puts you constantly makes you feel overwhelmingly satisfied . The most interesting thing about this game is its meaning since its very similar to real life and it has very interesting philosophical concepts . Its hard to pinpoint what truly is since every player experience it differently and its open for interpretation , and the story is hidden . Though the most common philosophy i can find is existentialism . By that i mean that not everything has meaning in Dark Souls . The player starts as a hollow , which is a state that a being is cursed and will not die and the Undead slowly lose their mind and consciousness . In order to become human they need humanity or else they delve deep into madness and pain . Humanity makes you into a human form but every time you reverse the hollowing you lose some part of your self (existence). For me the hollow-human state resembles a lot with Albert Camus " The Myth of Sisyphus " , since how much you try to escape or in this case to die peacefully you can 't, and then comes the realization of the absurd . Just like Sisyphus you are destined to progress through the world (Lordran) and discover some kind of meaning if there is any . Another thing about hollow state or rather Dark Souls itself is an allegory for depression . Dark Souls in general is a very depressive and sad game but the hollow state is a resemblance to it since the more you go hollow (feel pain , sadness , sorrow , misery and not doing anything about it ) the more you lose your self in depression . The game makes a good example on how you should progress and fight this state of mind just like in real life to overcome all the difficulties and hard times that we are faced . The NPC 's in this game have all really sad stories (and most of them die and you are unable to save them ) which makes you feel very compassionate , and understand their suffering . To dwell more on my interpretation a good example is a NPC called Solaire which has a quest to find the Sun (The Sun as a metaphor for hope and meaning ), but the more you progress in the game you will see that Solaire is losing his hope and will to fulfill his quest to find his Sun and slowly becomes hollow (you can save him but he is still affected ). The story is hidden in Dark Souls and you have to read item descriptions to learn something about the lore of this game . The design is one of the best aspect in this game since everything is interconnected and that makes it to be a more immersive experience . Also the game has a PvE and PvP aspect hence becoming a human will activate the PvP and you might get invaded more often in your game world , but another interesting thing is that by playing the game your character feels lonely and everything is against you , helping someone in PvP for a boss or from an invader is very satisfactory and the game encourages cooperation more . Though the most interesting aspect i find for this game is that it doesn 't make you important (rarely for a video game to do that ), rather you are there like many others who ventured in that unwelcomed world to find their meaning or to simply don 't go hollow . This game was a pleasant surprise and i really enjoyed it , i recommend it to everyone who wants to play a meaningful game . In short : Pros : +Gameplay +Design +Immersion +Difficulty +Sound Cons : -Capped 30 fps (Needs DSFix ) -For those using mouse (Needs dsmfix )

Despite being in alpha , Empyrion already offer many hours of fun ! Good for those who want to spend thousand hours building beautiful bases and ships but also good for explorers seeking new treasures (or to be more specific , epic weapons !) in alien buildings . Pros - Many planets - large options for building - different alien building to explore - active developer 's team with constant updates - Option to play single or multiplayer - You can create your own server Cons - Still buggy - Missing lot of details that will come later (like some animations , better AI ....) - For multiplayer , very careful when you choose a server , there are many trols and bug / glitch abusers - In single player aren 't much to do after 20 or so hours

You 're going to need to give the enemies more attention than you 're used to , and the controls will not be like those of a platformer . But if you 're willing to put some effort into learning the controls , it can be a very challenging and fun title . The art style and atmosphere created make this one of my favorite games . The enemies are interesting and well scripted , so that you 'll need to learn their individual strategies and weaknesses in order to deal with them . The three main playable characters have very different fighting styles and allow for customization of weapons , accessories and special moves . These can synergize to give the player much more power when the right combinations are found . The levels are procedurally generated , so each playthrough you 'll want to pay attention to the map layout to find the most desirable route . The different difficulties make quite a bit of difference in AI ability , and you 'll want to stick to the easy levels until you get the hang of it .

EA could learn that much from this game - sometimes less is more . you dont have the uber tricks in steep that ssx has ; but do you really need them ? i am enjoying the game , even though a lot of the other activities dont really interest me . it even has a sort of career mode thing going on , with levelling up getting you unlocks of the big peaks , and event invites - one of the earliest things in the beginner walkthrough at the start will unlock a red bull event . some of the custom gear you can wear is branded also . even though i bought this game when on offer (i think 70% off ) it had been on my wishlist , and i am very happy i got it . i would have paid normal price for it , had i known it was this good or had a trial version or something . i am looking at maybe buying the olympic stuff too . if you enjoy snowboarding or skiing or just the mountains , i think you might enjoy this one .

13380,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DansNotPro/recommended/91700,DansNotPro,91700,If Cyberpunk is currently your thing and Half-Life 's Source Engine has always been your thing : then I think you are probably going to find E .Y.E. Divine Cybermancy to be a very interesting game . If a Cyberpunk , FPS / RPG , with some of the most {?} ed up achievements aren 't enough to entice you to play this game , then I don 't know what will . My friend is a really big Cyberpunk fanatic and one day , he started showing me his progress in the game and I have to be honest - the Source Engine was noticable (almost straight away ), but I feel like that isn 't a bad thing , since it adds unique features , such as : a few RPG Elements (Levelling-Up, Research / Skills and Stats , Purchasing Item ...), Psi Force (A variety of mental / phsycic powers : sort of acts as the games Magic system ), Not only is it a Dark Cyberpunk world , but you can get really cool Augmentations / Upgrades for your character ! (Enhance your Vital Organs , Limbs , Nerves , Skeleton , Natural Resistence and much , much more ). The GENERAL combat system is what you 'd expect from a Source Engine-based game , however ; the extra features , selection of weapons , qwerky stat system , Psi Force abilities and the option to enhance your body with augmentions , just makes the combat a lot more vercetile , than any FPS or RPG that I have ever played . Oh yeah , EXPLODING MELEE WEAPONS - 93/100 !

We 've been playing this in versus for years now at every LAN party we have and we still very regularly team up by 4 just to go through a campaign or two together after work . It is an amazing game , one of my favourites and I recommend it to everyone who ever loved any shooter game :) There 's one thing though that I need to mention - this game is best played with 4 or 8 players . If you 're not really into co-op gameplay , playing with other real people , then this might not be the game for you - there is a single player mode where the other 3 human players are replaced by bots , but that 's just not the real thing .

13408,https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/446800,strategikal,446800,This game is the spiritual successor to Transport Tycoon , but brought up to date in full 3D glory . First impressions are very good . On the surface it looks just like Train Fever with ships and planes added , but there 's a lot more to it than that . It runs on a new game engine for a start , which solves the worst problem of the previous game , namely track and road laying , which could often be extremely frustrating . It 's still not perfect , but it 's considerably improved , with far more complex track connections possible . <url> The scenery is a lot more detailed when you look closely at it , with many more different buildings in the towns . The vehicle models are really well done , and they become dirty and rusty over time . Distant scenery blends better into the background with a misty effect . The most significant change is that they 've done away with the 20 minute rule and replaced it with catchment areas , which is probably more familiar in these types of games . Journeys can be of any length now , but passengers still prefer quicker transport . With freight it doesn 't matter so much , especially with ships that can carry huge amounts of cargo but travel very slowly . Along with that , resources and products no longer move on their own , instead you have to transport everything yourself and place stations in appropriate catchment areas to ensure that everything gets delivered to the right places . Industries now have more complex resource requirements . If part of the supply chain is missing it will grind to a halt . This makes the game more challenging compared to Train Fever , in which you could provide partial transport routes and the AI would automatically fill in the gaps . In keeping with the more complex industries , there are now six different types of products that need to be transported to towns , three to the commercial districts and three to the industrial districts . This makes things even more complex since you need to use more depots to ensure the town is well supllied , although you apparently only need to supply one industrial and one commercial product (in addition to passenger transport ) to help cities grow , making the more complex industrial chains seem somewhat unnecessary . Regarding money , even on the easy level there can be a lot of time spent waiting to make a profit from your lines before you can expand , and the harder levels are much more difficult . If you prefer to build without limits , you can apply a mod which removes money from the game , but you don 't get any achievements in that mode . In addition to the main random game , there are also two campaigns included , one for Europe and one for the USA , featuring several scenarios each . I haven 't tried these myself , but they provide you with a story and clear goals to win each scenario . They 're probably a good way to help learn the game if you haven 't played Train Fever previously . To sum up , Transport Fever can be very engrossing . Personally I 'm finding it just as addictive as Civilization , but instead of " one more turn " there 's always one more line to create , a new train to build , vehicles to upgrade , a line to update or some other problem to solve . " I 'll just finish doing this then I 'll go to bed , but I need to sort out that problem first , oh and there 's that other thing I need to look at , and while I 'm at it ..." If you enjoy these types of games , this is a no brainer . We 've been waiting a very long time for a spiritual successor to Transport Tycoon . Many similar games have come and gone over the years , but this is the first that truly deserves that accolade . It 's the best game in the genre in my opinion .

Review Celeste really surprised me in so many ways . I knew from the onset that I was getting involved with a very difficult game , one that sits comfortably next to Super Meat Boy and Cuphead in terms of difficulty , and that the possibility was high for it to irritate me in equal measure and while there were many a moment I could feel my blood pressure reaching dangerous levels , Celeste 's main protagonist , Madeline , had charmed her way so far into my heart that to abandon her and her journey would simply have broken my heart . For the 20 hours it took me to summit Mount Celeste , not only did I come away with enjoying some of the most fluid and responsive platform mechanics I have yet experienced in a game to date , what really surprised me was the depth the game went in order to tell its story . Celeste 's story is hauntingly relatable as it tackles such deep and dark subjects as depression , anxiety , self-doubt and self-loathing all which symbolically begin to represent the very mountain Madeline is trying to summit . For Madeline her depression has taken root so strongly that as the tale unfolds we begin to acutely understand her desperation at overcoming the challenge she has set for herself and we genuinely fear what her other alternatives might me should she fail . Madeline 's journey of self-discovery ends up being a beautiful one and one I really recommend each and everyone of you experience . For those that want to climb Mount Celeste but don 't necessarily have the patience or the precision skills there is an assist mode if you feel the need to use it . Celeste often took me to the point of breaking , asking the impossible from me as each and every challenge got progressively more difficult , but there was always the sweet , sweet satisfaction that of lay at the end of completing a grueling level or area . The last chapter , just before summiting (checkpoint 13 and 2 , I am looking at you ) had some of the most hardcore challenges ever put to me by a single game , so much so that I ended up developing a blister on my right index finger from holding the right controller trigger down for so long , but the thrill of reaching the top of the mountain was a feeling second to none as I furiously fist pumped the air in excitement and relief as I had helped Madeline overcome her difficulties so that she could hopefully begin to start living in a more gentler and lovelier light . Featuring a soundtrack that is so sublime it should be illegal , Celeste is not only one of my favorite games of the year , it has now become the gold standard by which I will judge this genre . One word to sum up the experience Challenging Performance / Bug related incidents I had no performance issues whatsoever and did not encounter any bugs / defects in my 20 hour playtime Similar to games Super Meat Boy ; Ori and the Blind Forest ; Hollow Knight ; Cuphead Suitable for People who enjoy a serious challenge but also for those who enjoy excellent narrative , charming characters and life messages that affirm positivity Current position in my games of 2018 cleared list 4th position .

I heard that the people aren 't even able to select servers now . You will be forced to play in a server where you might get 200 ping , you won 't be able to pickup any survival items on time . * I would still recommend this game to those who are up for casual gaming and not serious gaming . Serious gamers will probably rage when they face these minor bugs and ping issues .

13427,https://steamcommunity.com/id/elio_jojo/recommended/345260,elio_jojo,345260,I really , really like the game . The gameplay etc is really good as pointed out in other reviews , but it just runs so embarrassingly bad on windows 10. .. My gtx1050 gives me 4-12 fps and when switch over to integrated graphics I get an average of 17 fps . These low framerate on such a old game paired with the flickering of the loading screen and ramdomly going to my desktop is pretty damn frustrating . I haven 't found a working fix for these performance issues yet , but would love to be helped or even better to see CA fixing the game itself . I would love to recommand this game , but I wouldn 't want anybody bothering to deal with these issues when just wanting to play a solid TW

First of all , I think the biggest problem is that some content just feels missing unless you have the dlc 's, its kind of a problem . But other than that , the game is very clear , its not hard to learn the basic strategies and what not but , its not an instant thing . Overall decent game .
13429,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004578209/recommended/497400,76561198004578209,497400,Don 't know if I 'm the right person to write this review because I have a soft spot for HOG 's. A HOG was the first type of game I ever played . Read the reviews and I gather this game had a somewhat lukewarm reception . If this is true then I am in for gaming goodness on the other HOG 's on Steam because I really enjoyed this game . The story was interesting and the puzzles and graphic scenes blended well . All puzzles could be worked without auto finish or looking up solutions on guides . I have a serious problem with how the search list for the HO sections are always too close to objects which can cause you to accidentally hit the something you don 't want to hit . If you like HOG 's I 'm sure you 'll like this one though I have played other games like this that left a finer impression on me . I do think it is worth you checking out .

13432,https://steamcommunity.com/id/VdriVeZ/recommended/280320,VdriVeZ,280320,so far so good but , i would be good if you put the option in main menu , (so we don 't have to play and see tutorial before changing the sound etc ) and , maybe creating a save slot , like 4 save slot . some players maybe want to create more kingdom , but didn 't want to lose their save progress . or for example , my friend can play from my pc and using different save slot . and , i can 't open skill list inside the dungeon . and when i finish the dungeon , the skill list pop up . i don 't know if the developer didn 't let us review skill inside the dungeon or maybe it 's just some bug . sorry if my english bad . peace :D EDIT : if the developer can make an option in side quest wether we play it automated or manual . it will be awesome my rate so far 8.5/10

Get to know your classmates and search for clues , all while the looming presence of despair joyfully reminds you that no one is safe . Being one half an interactive visual novel with 3D elements , and one half shooter with minigames , with it 's large story and cast of voice actors , Danganronpa does a great job of showing what can be done with the visual novel platform and how it can be improved beyond it 's genre . Upupupupu !
13435,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040375092/recommended/403190,76561198040375092,403190,As of the time I 'm writing this review , 24th November 2015 , I cannot recommend this game . It looks like a nice and interesting concept , but the execution is far from playable . There are too many resources to manage , and the smallest mistake means failure . Sooner or later , your colonists will be dead , the only thing which can change is the cause . Lack of oxygen , lack of water , lack of food , lack of medical supplies , lack of spare parts to repair power generators which produce oxygen ... I 'd appreciate some varying difficulty , the game seems to only have one difficulty level - impossible mode . The AI is just {?} , which wouldn 't be a problem if you could manually override what the colonists are doing . Currently , it often doesn 't matter if you prioritize some building . The colonists can just stand idle doing nothing ! It is a shame , because the visuals seem nice , even though you can 't fully control the camera and there is no " possess " mode of Dungeon Keeper .
13436,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BeholderVee/recommended/22340,BeholderVee,22340,The game suffers from some technical issues , but I 've enjoyed it immensely regardless . It has this feature that games used to do but not so much anymore - having lots of gameplay variety in one solid game . It 's all one engine , but in one level you 're defenseless and have to sneak past everyone , another you cross with guns blazing , the third is a mix of both , the fourth one is practically a first-person adventure game , and there 's more .

13443,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeepDiscovery/recommended/8930,DeepDiscovery,8930,This is perhaps my all time favorite video game . That is saying something . That isn 't to call this a perfect game , just to say it is the best one for me . Let 's give you the rundown , The list of what is discussed is at the top , the breakdown of each is in order following . Pros -Smooth Gameplay / Quality Rendering -Endless Ways to Win -Effective Multiplayer (And a still active community to play with ) -Moddability -Plenty of Content (Even without the DLC 's and Mods ) Cons -Games are not Short -Bugs on Mac Version -No New Official Content -DLC Pricing Smooth Gameplay / Quality Rendering The game has beautiful graphics requiring an ok computer to process at times . The combat animations are wonderful , and provide a short little " Ahhhh " of satisfaction , even when your units are being destroyed . The overall feel of the game is fairly seamless , the controls intuative . That 's not to say there isn 't a steep learning curve , it is a strategy game after all . But once you understand the basics , which it walks you through nicely , it is simple enough to start a game and get going . (It is no simple matter to win consistantly ) Endless Ways to Win If you doubt my sincerity , look at the achievements for the game . This is not a game for someone who hopes to get all the achievements . Simply winning a game can require days of gameplay . There are many different people to play as , and each has a different approach to each form of victory . I have yet to win the same way twice . There are also scenarios if you don 't want to play the AI 's, which are plenty hard , or people you know or don 't know online . Effective Multiplayer & Active Community Many older games are still fun games , but are lacking in people to play . Fear not , at any given time , there are people online putting together matches . They may take a minute to put together but playing against people is where it 's at . Beyond the community the multiplayer is practically perfect , with an intuative setup interface that allows you to swing the game however you want , from 10 vs . 1 to 5 teams of 2 , or even starting from the space age . The overall multiplayer expierience is beautiful . Modability This one is self explanitory , but deserves a note . The game has a built in function to enable mods . Find cool mods , install , enjoy . Plenty of Content The game is so loaded with content that as I mentioned earlier , you won 't be getting all the achievements . Sorry , you won 't, and that 's before the DLC 's. Games are NOT Short The games can run anywhere from 5 minutes , to ... Well , some games just aren 't meant to end , right ? The average game for me (Non-Scenario, Normal or Quick Pace , King Difficulty or Higher ) runs 10-15 hours . Some people will be faster some will be slower , but these are not generally one sit playthroughs . If you don 't have patience to sit the test of time , you 'll never know if the empire you can build will stand the test of time . Bugs on Mac Version Long story short , there are rendering errors with some of the " Brave New World " DLC content on the mac . This is not the base game , but I felt it should be mentioned . No New Offical Content This game is older . You cannot be expecting new content on a game as old as this . Have fun with what is already there . DLC Pricing This game is not cheap , neither are the DLC . I reccomend if you 're going to pick it up , to grab it on sale . When it goes on sale you can grab it and its DLC for a much more reasonable price . Conclusion Although the game has its flaws , and plenty of them ( I only hit a few here ). It is still my favorite game to grab a couple buddies and play . We can spend hours building treaties and alliances , only to shatter them and eachother 's dreams . And hey , dropping a nuke on an unsuspecting city now and again is fun .

13445,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dymarob/recommended/271590,Dymarob,271590,They have gone way too far to push the multiplayer .
13446,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thisistruefatcj/recommended/17500,thisistruefatcj,17500,Pros : + Playing as survivors and zombies like Contagion + Lot of weapons (double-barrel shotgun , wrench , M4 , AK47 , USP and more ) + Lot of maps (20+ maps ) + Diverse maps not like " go to A , later go to B and kill some zombies " + Choice of 8 survivors + Steam Workshop support + More frequent updates than year earlier Cons : - Zombies in my opinion is too OP , they have unlimited lives in Objective mode , so if you have a bad team , pray that you will not die - After 3.0 update very stupid crashes like switching flashlight , loading some maps or making server with enabled cheats - Some achievements aren 't working (I mean zombie wins on Sapidcerebrum , Shreddingfield and Corpsington map ) fixed Good game , 8/10.
13447,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Viper5030/recommended/770560,Viper5030,770560,0.1 hrs , that 's right . But I 've seen enough . This game is lacking in every aspect , from gameplay to graphics to controls . I took one look and ran -you should do the same ... for now . If the devs do something quick and I decide to give it another shot , I 'll make sure to update this review .
13448,https://steamcommunity.com/id/doppleganger4827/recommended/413420,doppleganger4827,413420,More death , more drama , more despair ! While not shying away from the format estasblished in the first game , DR2 : Goodbye Despair takes your new cast of classmates to a new setting : an island paradise that cloakes the dark presence that intends to spread paranoia and distrust among your classmates . With new aspects , such as the Tamagotchi-esque menu game and new trial minigames , DR2 : Goodbye Despair keeps what made it 's first game compelling while adding some new features .

13452,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DansNotPro/recommended/9450,DansNotPro,9450,I thought Dark Crusade was hard , but when I started to play Soulstorm , I wasn 't even ready for the improvements from the last expansions . In Dark Crusade you try to conquer a single planet (named Kronus ), which is represented by a single meta-map . However , on Soulstorm you are shown a solar system featuring 6-7 distinct planets , each being fought by 8 different races (including your own race and two new races : Dark Eldar + Sisters of Battle ). I was dazzled by this freedom to conquer different planets , grow my army with planetary points and expand my races empire galactically . I was also raging at times , as the AI is a lot more unpredictible , yet very tactical about how they ; not only move around each planet to prevent you from taking over , but how they swiftly send troops to demolish your base if you aren 't playing the game fast enough . If there is two tips to give anyone who wants to play , then the first would be : To do everything you can as quickly as you can , you should never be idle in the game (technically, unless you 're winning / waiting on resources ). Second tip would be for you to keep saving Planetary points for your character / army at all times . It 's really useful when you want to invade a stronghold and you need Honor Guard Units to help you sweep the enemy in an early match . 100/100 !

13455,https://steamcommunity.com/id/elio_jojo/recommended/345240,elio_jojo,345240,Love the game , but I won 't support Creative Assembly until they apologize for disrespecting their customers . I recommend you do the same until they get back to making good historical games without a political agenda behind them and without hiding behind the excuse of their games are historically authentic (whatever that means ) instead of historically accurate and so forth .. Things I would like to see getting fixed in this game are : -The random chrashes -The screen flickering when going to a loading screen -Randomly going to my desktop and back I really do hope that CA sees their mistakes and stops doubling down on their ignorant statements just like they handled the spywarer controversy
13456,https://steamcommunity.com/id/freezestar22/recommended/422810,freezestar22,422810,Do you like difficult games that require skill and stat managment ? Do you like games were you run around with your friends and beat things senseless ? This game has both of those things and so much more ! River City Ransom Underground is a Beat-Em-Up for 1-4 players (Local or Online ). Story The story takes place several years after the original River City Ransom and the gang your character (or characters ) has been accused of kidnapping something Merv (the biggest buisiness owner in River City ) holds dear . Your goal is to figure out who framed you and maybe even find the true secret behind this city 's biggest secrets . Gameplay Gameplay is very similar to the original River City Ransom with some a sprinkling of modern features like Super Moves and Combos . Each character feels different and unique from the Breakdancing Provie to the Boxer Paul , you are guarenteed to have a unique experience with each character . Difficulty As mentioned earlier this game this game is not easy in singleplayer . The game throws a lot of enemies at you so you got to make sure to pick your fights or stock up on " Healthy " (and stat-increasing ) items because if you die , it 's all the way back to the last hideout . While things get slightly easier with more people (especially due the fact that if you die , you respawn on the next screen if your friend survives ), later on enemies get a lot smarter and learn to dodge and block more often . Music The soundtrack to this game is really good . It sounds like it could easily fit in with the original River City Ransom soundtrack while still sounding unique . Some of favorite tracks include " Punch Hungry " and the " River City Anthem " Graphics The graphics feel very classic . It does a good job at mimicing the style of the old games while making thing looks a lot more detailed and colorful , it looks like a supercharged version of the original . Conclusion This is very fun game and an even more fun with friends , while for some people it might be a bit on the short side if you know what you are doing , there is plenty of replayability with the amount of playable character it has .

Also look at that art style it 's gorgeous .
13464,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zombiecat1/recommended/550,zombiecat1,550,awesome game , what more can i say .
13465,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DansNotPro/recommended/219640,DansNotPro,219640,Chivlary : Medieval Warfare is exactly what it says on the tin . It is pretty much Medieval Warfare ! Swords , Bows , Throwing Knives , Warhammers , Claymores , Polearms and much , much more . If you have played anything like Mount & Blade , then you will love the experience that this game provides in-terms of combat . Your first layer of choices is your class and obviously , some classes are fast , some are strong , but most are restricted to certain weapon choices , however , even the weapons have various advantages as well : Like Reach , Speed and Damage . This means you can be a bulky Knight who can take damage , while using a maul for maximum damage or maybe you want to be a fast unit , who can use staves / polearms to reach people from as far away as possible ? Despite all it 's choices , however , I do believe some weapons need to be unlocked / purchased . There are two factions - Agatha Knights and The Mason Order . Weirdly enough , black and red are my two favourite colours , but I still choose Agatha Knights . " Thank you , Brother !" Now , don 't expect a load of content in this game , it is pretty much like most online PVP games ; were you have rounds , kill other players , earn EXP and all that stuff , only it handles the " art of warfare " very nicely . Swings and blocks are required consisntently . Despite the limited content , there are still mods , various game modes and I just keep coming back to play more Black Knight Mode (a mod that lets you lose limbs in combat , I highly recommend picking it up !) The only thing I advise : You will find some pretty nice people , every now and then , who are worth adding and training with in duel mode . However , most of the times , the community can pretty toxic for absolutely no reason and in some duel servers you are going to find idiots who can 't read server descriptions for {?} and just straight-up kill you for no reason . So it 's best not to let anything get to your head , just find a new game or play with your friends . Don 't let it tempt you not to play this game . I definitely recommend picking it up , even if it doesn 't go on offer . You can even get the " Deadliest Warriors " DLC (which should of been a part of the game , in my opinion , but I digress ), which allows you play as a Samurai , Knight , Ninja , Pirate , Viking and Spartan characters . If you can block , then you 'll have a good time ! - 95/100

The controls aren 't nearly the same . You can only use the " wasd " keys and " er " for rotation . And with controllers or a joystick , you have to tap very fast to get where you want . It feels awful , and I couldn 't even win a match against the computer because of these awful controls . Unless the dev team adds mouse or better controls , this game is not worth purchasing . You 're better off buying any version of Rampart on console . It 's sad because Rampart is one of my favorite games , and I was really looking forward to a decent remake to play against other friends that loved it back in the day .

I had been meaning to play it for years , but had never really been too interested to actually buy it , but when I saw it was in the Overwhelmingly Positive 2 Bundle on Humblebundle I thought , what the hell , if nothing else there were some of the other games I was quite a bit interested in . I have yet to play any of those other games , because Jesus Christ did Lisa take me by storm . In the game you play the character of Bradley Armstrong , a man haunted by his past on a quest to save his adoptive daughter , traversing a dangerous wasteland of perverts , freaks , gangs and mutants , forced to overcome various obstacles along the way , some of which can have permanent repurcussions for you and your party of weirdos . The game is extremely dark when the story deems it necessary , but also has a great deal of lighthearted goofiness to it , balancing out the tone as to not be completely miserable . It was a fantastic journey , I played through the main game thrice and the DLC two times , just because I wanted to 100% it . It is maybe the only game I 've ever truly been invested enough in to actually go that far , hell , I 'm going to buy the OST sometime soon , because that 's a whole other ballpark of awesome . If you 're even remotely a fan of RPGs , exploration , dark themes , great story-telling , trippy visuals or incredible soundtracks , then definitely be sure to check this game out , do yourself the favor man .

My only beef with it at the moment is that if you 're trying to be a commander rather than just running around the battlefield shooting and stabbing (and getting shot and stabbed ), it 's a bit clunky . So far I 've had minimal luck actually controlling my troops . What I 'd like to see is 1 ) the ability to form ranks and files , 2 ) give advance , hold , and retreat orders in formation , plus orders like wheel right / wheel left , charge , et hoc genus omne . 3 ) be able to ride a horse so you can see the battlefield better . Even in its current state though it is fun and worth a look .

You can all call it what you will , but I thought it was fun for a quick bas , but nothing more than 30mins before the frustration sets in . Titan attacks is the re-imagined space invaders for the younger generation . After booting it up for the first time , the neon graphics took hold and determination set in to see just how much these developers wanted me to like there game . It has persistent upgrades to aim for , boss fights , different enemy types with differing attacks . It is essentially , it is still space invaders , just with a bit of makeup and sheeps fur . I have now played 10hrs and have fully enjoyed the experience . This coming from somebody who doesn 't like space invaders ! 8/10

13501,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jessercuyler/recommended/211400,jessercuyler,211400,It 's short , I beat the story in under 5 hours . Once the story is complete it unlocks knightmare mode . Going through on knightmare , completing the game 100% and unlocking achievements will add additional replay value . The story itself isn 't terrible , but it 's nothing special either . Gameplay is the highlight of this game , but can sometimes be frustrating . Simple controls don 't respond every so often making your character miss a jump , not turning properly to hit a zombie , resulting in death or losing hp . I got the game on sale for $3 so I would have to recommend for that price , however buying the game full price I would not recommend . Update : Changing my review to not recommend , due to the " remasted edition " and people who already own the game get screwed over . No thanks . Dont recommend the game or developers / publishers .

Where FTL exists to punish all that come calling , this one at least lets you get comfortable before it starts screwing you over . Difficulty wise , its a bear . Even on the easy mode i was still getting it up the exit door . Graphics are nicer and more well rounded , bright and crisp . It shares a lot of the same elements as FTL but the biggest element is there are no fuel points . You 're free to explore the map as you see fit . Because of its likeness to FTL i wouldn 't have paid full price for it , but on sale it 's a decent bargain .

OTWD requires a plan or else it will eat you alive . One will pay about $6 a mission at this point of launch with promises of a second season with initial purchase . The graphics , gun handling and sound are on point in this game . If you have friends to play with this game is MUCH better . Finiding a public game sucks . If you like the walking dead franchise and like 4 player co-op games then this game is great . If you want this to be Left 4 Dead 3/Payday 3/Battlefield 9 ,523/PUBG then save us the wall of text and go play Forknife . If you 're on the fence , I 'd wait to see how season 2 is received . I 've put 74 hours into this game and I have one of my characters at level 30. I am looking forward to season 2 ! Hope to see you there .

13512,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198165930115/recommended/380150,76561198165930115,380150,A heavily qualified recommendation . I 'm a big fan of adventure games and sci-fi . Event Horizon is one of my favorite scary movies . In sum of which , I was excited to get my hands on this title . It starts out with a great deal of promise , dumping the player into an atmosphere dripping with dread and uncertainty . The adventure-game mechanics are acceptable if prosaic . Janky pathfinding detracts from the immersion of the beautifully rendered backgrounds . Sound and music get the job done . Unfortunately , the game cannot sustain either its atmosphere or narrative propulsion , and I found myself slogging through the back half to third . Here , puzzle quality seems to deteriorate - I note one particular puzzle the solution to which , and I don 't count this to be much of a spoiler , is to find the one spot of gore in the dark in a generally gory environment that you can click to pick-up . Furthermore , and more importantly , the narrative breaks down too , the more it is illuminated . Early on , the mystery and atmosphere drove me forward from room to room , hoping to uncover the secrets of what was taking place . The pieces come together inelegantly by info dump when you locate the logs of the various crew on your derelict ship . Unlike , say System Shock 2 , where information about the calamity was doled out piecemeal and the story of the crew built up over the time of a playthrough , when you find a log in Stasis you learn everything about that particular individual . Rather than putting together pieces of the story for a given crewmember into a whole over time , you read through the batch of text and largely close the door on that piece of narrative . When the lives of crew do intertwine , such relatinoships are generally illustrated almost immediately - a different room say in the same section . In this way , there is little sense of the story unfolding organically and instead bits of narrative are arranged around the geography of the ship - one area , one story . Meanwhile , the larger narrative starts out with a note of promising if unexpected camp , before fizzling altogether . So dedicated is the game to its bleakness that by the time a very bad thing happens , the outcome was not just predictable but expected and inevitable . Through this single-mindedness the game lost its capacity to surprise , and was thereby stripped of the emotional heft the narrative worked hard to set up . The game is so intent on shocking with its horrors , that I found it ultimately numbing instead . It became an exercise in bad things happening , rather than a propulsive story of humanity in the grips of horrible things . Finally , the story as it winds down does little to make sense of itself or the characters driving it and the final twists and turns elicited shrugs in place of aha moments . To close , lest you think this review is a thumbs-down , I would add that the above criticism stems from my ultimate disappointment in the product as a whole . Given my genre interests , I am still thrilled that this game was made . The game started out very well , with plenty of promise in the premise . However , I ultimately stopped enjoying myself as the game shook itself apart the longer I played - the story was not coherent enough to keep me invested in the adventuring and the adventuring was not robust enough , despite a couple of glowing moments , to keep me pushing through for the puzzles . I 'm happy I played it through , but don 't have any lingering affection for it . TL ;DR if you are a fan of sci-fi (particularly sci-fi / horror ) and point-and-click adventure games , there 's enough here to justify a playthrough . That said , returns diminish as the game wears on and fails to amount to much . Still , a promising enough release and cause to be hopeful for the future output of the developer .

I have been excited to see what new things are added and what new features are to come . With the actual realease date coming up , I wanted to give my thoughts as a member (albiet an anti social one ) of the Conan Exiles community . First off , I play single player . So some of my thoughts will be limited by that fact . I know a big aspect of this game is the multiplayer angle , but surely how it plays when you are all by yourself counts for something too . I loved the change in AI from the npc 's where instead of all ganging up to kill you , they actually attack each other . I don 't find this to be an issue as some others have . I have never come to an area where there is just one creature left bloody and almost dead . I also appriciated when the respawn rate was chilled out . I remember when I was first playing and going into caves or encampments was a suicide mission because the npc 's would respawn behind you . Finnally the ability to make Dafari gear has pleased me greatly . They are my race of choice . However , as a single player I would like the thrall system to be more helpful . I know that the game is not complete but I must stress how much the thralls are needed when playing alone . Better AI and the ability to take more than one would be nice . Also , to me it would be more immersive if the npc 's you killed dropped the gear they had . I don 't think this provides too much ease as to repair said gear you have to have the approprite skills . So even if you do get something that lets you punch out of your weight class for a little bit , it will eventually break and become useless untill you can repair it . Also , equipment that can repel heat a little better would be nice . But other than that I love this game and cannot wait until the full version is realeased .

13525,https://steamcommunity.com/id/NiwaHanake/recommended/568750,NiwaHanake,568750,Personally , to me the story isn 't very engaging and that is mostly due to the fact that the english version is translated quite poorly . Sometimes not even names are spelled correctly . Something also bothering me is the fact this game seems like it 's pulled together from free assets , there is no definitive art style in this game , and not even the main characters remain consistent between sprite and CG . I got myself one ending , but I just can not be bothered to go back and get the other endings . If the gameplay was just more well-balanced and / or a little trickier to get just right I 'd have probably liked the game a lot more ... but if you get this on sale I guess it balances out with price vs . quality . Personally , I wouldn 't buy this at full price .

I wasn 't really feeling it after the first couple of hours as the 30 fps lock and PSP-esque upgraded graphics were not doing a lot for me . But after coming back to it a couple years after first trying it I enjoyed it a lot more . Once you get past some of the issues there 's actually quite a fun and diverse combat system with plenty to do alongside a decent story .

There is and there isn 't a lot to Counter Strike , and it subtleness is what I find most addictive . It almost feels like the creators left enough out of the game that the player has to come along and finish it off . The player 100% makes the game in CS : GO . When I first looked into getting the game I read a lot about the community being toxic , and can be true at times , but there are a lot of good people on it too , so don 't be put off . Final Thoughts CS :GO is still my go to game and I still love it as much as even . When I can 't play it because I 'm up at University , I watch eSport tournaments (Cloud 9 supporter ) and read around it . CS : GO has defiantly become much more than just a game to me now .

13549,https://steamcommunity.com/id/maxer00/recommended/353270,maxer00,353270,Third time 's the charm (?) Fan 's rejoice - the third game of Neptunia is here ! Other gamers take a peak - another anime-style JRPG is here ! But is it a plain copy of the previous two games , or maybe it had some major improvements that makes it the best (Neptunia) game so far ? Story Re ;birth 3 once again places the player in the Gamindustri world , ruled by Goddesses [ideafintl.com] . Each rule a nation that represent a console company (Lastation - > Playstation , Leanbox - > Xbox , and so on ) All seem peaceful after the events of Re ;birth 2 , but our lazy and goofy main character just had to get herself in trouble again , didn 't she ? The story is of the same pace as the previous games - it doesn 't take itself too seriously , with it 's long-winded boobie talk just before a serious boss battle , obscure gaming references at every single corner and blunt 4th wall breakings (The main character lives just to break it ). But even so , Re ;birth 3 probably tells the longest and most decent story out of the 3 so far , which I personally enjoyed greatly . But do take note , that if it 's a story-driven RPG you 're looking for , you might need to rethink if this is what you 're after . Gameplay The game 's battle system remains mostly unchanged . It 's still the typical turn based JRPG battle with the exception of being able to move the characters around for flanking and accurate special skill attacks (trust me it 's much more simple than it sounds ). The only change is the merge of SP bar and EXE drive bar , which is a healthy change . Before , you could just spam SP attacks and then finish it with very powerful EXE attacks . Now , you have to use SP for both specials and EXE attacks , so you have to play more smart . The dungeon exploring remains mostly unchanged besides another very good change : the hidden treasure is no longer an invisible item in the dungeon that you had to spam a button to radar-search for it , it 's now a mostly transparent Mario-type block that casts a shadow that the player can bump his head into for extra loot . The levelling system finally feels balanced , the game doesn 't suddenly throw in undefeatable mobs to get killed by , and you don 't get too powerful too quickly (unless you use certain Plans ...) The Chirper also returns which is a direct replacement to talking to NPCs in other RPG games . It basically has almost zero use besides getting references , funny thoughts and similiar things . Though for some players it might be something to look forward to during each chapter start . And the fun auto-exploring Stella 's dungeon minigame returns again . This time , with more stuff to do . And with faster exploring too , which is a plus too . And this minigame also solves the problem of farming for materials as you can get a lot of them from the minigame too , while doing something else . Like reading the plot . Speaking of plot , you will be met by a lot of it . A lot of text that is . Sometimes it really pulls the player out of the action just to read dozens of lines of text . While story is important , from time to time you may feel as the " actual gameplay VS story reading " balance is off . Luckily you can still choose to skip the text relatively fast , or set it on AUTO , so you can read / listen to it while eating even ! Options . There are not many . You can switch the resolution , camera sensitivity , fullscreen mode , language and there are sound sliders . Also key bindings . Other than that there is not much to choose from . And finally the Remake / Plan system , one of the highlights of Neptunia Re ;birth's game mechanics for me . As before , it allows the player to " alter " how the game works . What that means is basically this is the unlock system . You want new dungeons ? Unlock a plan and then gather materials to make a new dungeon . Need more items armor clothes etc .? Repeat what you did for the dungeon . And while this Remake system offers a lot of changes (Monster strength , BGM music change , Clothing , Stella 's dungeon additions ), it 's not as hard to farm all the required materials for all the plans to unlock everything . Which is certainly nice . (Unless you 're one of those people who need to unlock a " My waifu " accessory for all the girls , in which case farming is your problem , buddy !) Graphics and Sounds The game 's as colorful as before , looks beautiful in 720p and higher , the character models remain unchanged and that 's fine since they do look splendid . A first time player will certainly enjoy the way they look and move , while those who played the previous games might wish for more variety or change . The dungeons and monsters are also more or less the same , with some healthy additions , but a veteran player will certainly be bothered by enemy recolorings and same dungeon re-using . All of the cast is fully voiced , with menu and overworld included . Only a few cutscenes are text-only . Each dungeon type has it 's own BGM as it should , and boss fights have their own too , though some are re-used from previous games . I personally didn 't mind it , as the music is not an annoyance in Re ;birth games . Japanese versus English The game originates from Japan as you may already know . But the cast is voiced both in japanese and english , which is quite awesome . The quality of both is superb so choose whichever you fancy more - squeaky typical-anime-ish japanese , or " dub " english . (Please don 't take the " dub " part seriously ) The only minus I had with the localization is the fact that the translated story text is still full of *achem* memes . It 's not as bad as it was in Re ;birth2 where you couldn 't take the story seriously due to how the translation partakes the story in the wrong way . And trust me , when somebody tells you to " stabby stabby kill kill " another person while dramatic music plays , the experience is ruined . Luckily as I 've mentioned , the translation got better and it 's not as off , as it was before . DLC 's & Bugs A surprise - the game comes with all DLC 's besides the Stella dungeon goodie (which is still a very useful DLC ). That means you get to use up to 28 instead of 10 characters if you wish . And grind up to 999th level instead of a measly 99. The DLC characters get a few sub-stories which is a nice addition . And strangely enough they get more stories than in previous games where (most of them ) were already in the game without DLCs . You also get extra super equipment Plans . But if you don 't want none of that you can always turn off the DLC 's before starting the game , which is quite helpful for those who wish to do so . And whether you 'll want to grind to the max is up to the player , as the extra dungeons do not introduce any more important story additions . The game sadly comes with some bugs that don 't allow players with low amounts of RAM or with certain Intel integrated graphic cards to play the game without crashes , so beware of that . Some are easily fixable , which is a relief as I myself had to find a quick fix for my own crash issue . I suggest reading up on any other potential game breaking issues before deciding to get the game as you may or may not encounter problems along the way . Final Verdict As a fan of the Neptunia series I was pleased by Re ;birth 3 : The game 's performance got a boost . The story got a boost in length and quality . The gameplay was also balanced for a more enjoyable experience . And while the game still does not let go of it 's habits of reusing old material , and it 's grindy parts for the completionists , I feel that this game is certainly worth a try for both fans and those who enjoy a not-too-serious JRPG experience . Unless you 're a very serious gamer who takes his games seriously , and you require a serious plot and seriously amazing gameplay I recommend this game . It 's quite fun .

13559,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PratzStrike/recommended/247870,PratzStrike,247870,This review is appropriate for the 1.04 release as of 2/11/2014. I recently picked up this game on their $1 sale on Groupees in Be Mine 11 , and I have to say that while I enjoyed the game , I believe that around $1 is what the game is worth . The gameplay is reminiscent of other turn-based character sims such as Princess Maker and Long Live The Queen - you have a set number of actions and turns a day with which to improve your character and get to know people around the station . You earn money by going to work every weekday , and you have the weekends off with which to do whatever you want . While I recommend the game , I do so with a caveat - get it for cheap . It 's good to see more character-based sims , but there are a lot of problems with Redshirt I found annoying . For instance , if you 're in a relationship , your partner will repeatedly bug you every day , even if you spend every action in both weekdays with them , they 'll still feel hurt and lonely and want more attention . Also , interests seem to be very difficult to sway back and forth , which is a vital part of getting more friends on Spacebook , towards the late game , especially since one of the best early ways to make friends is to take them to one of the healthy cheap lunch places - which jacks up your Fitness interest . I would have preferred a system where you gained levels in interests much as you did skills , instead of simply having 100% with which to split amongst the varied things you have to do in a day 's time . I do enjoy the game 's sarcastic tone of humor , and am glad to see more games of this style , so I can say it 's worth at least a playthrough - as long as it 's a playthrough that only costs one or two Karmacredits .

13562,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sid1120/recommended/381210,sid1120,381210,The short version : if you want a repetitive game of Cat & Mouse , this is it . I played it quite enough and although I enjoyed the game , I wouldn 't recommend buying it per-say (Unless it 's around 5-10 $). Reason : Gameplay is very limited and super repetitive . Every game is pretty much the exact same . They can be enjoyable , but never different . The game mechanics are also flawed in many ways . For example , camping is actually a tactic favored by the game in many cases . Or : as a new player , you play against players with a bunch of perks (Where as other , better designed games would give you a few initial choices that you can swap out for new stuff that you get later ). All of the " meh " designed mechanics pile up . It 's not bad by any mean , but it 's not great . It 's good , in a market where " good " just doesn 't cut it anymore .

It reminds me of the Adventure games of yore where it is best to take notes , make maps , draw diagrams and exam everything . I took my time and I worked on a section at a time trying to complete it before moving on . The puzzles can be challenging , but your note taking efforts will greatly help . This also comes in mighty helpful when it is necessary to go back into an area . These efforts will help to complete the game as it should be completed and the rewards for doing so are three-fold . The story is in-depth with a lot of substance . It 's also a teaching experience . I finished with tears in my eyes , a filled heart and a mind enveloped in wonderment .

13569,https://steamcommunity.com/id/versat1l/recommended/110800,versat1l,110800,How to describe L .A. Noire best ? : a love / hate relationship . Its story-driven point &click aspect is addictive . On the other side the game itself is a total disaster based on common videogame standards . Don 't look for a GTA-like or a sandbox game , there 's nothing of that here . It 's an open-world map at most , in which you can drive and explore the marvelous Los Angeles of 1947 , reconstructed like nothing else before . So I 'll start to address this review to the gamers expecting a GTA-like or sandbox gameplay prior to developing further in my review . Let 's see if you make it through the following checklist ... _ Are you a movie guy ? A film noir die hard fan ? Did you dig L .A. Confidential and Taxi Driver ? _ Do you like old school investigation point & click 's? _ Can you stand a giant map without the ability to shoot everything you see ? If you checked " no " to any of the above , then stop wasting your time and don 't read further . This game is not for you . The background and core intrigue are what make L .A. Noire great . Not once the player 's intelligence is disrespected - its story-telling easily match Hollywood 's most notorious Noir films - a linear game suitting Rockstar 's 'noir' imprint . Cole Phelps , the main protagonist (you), is one of those incorruptible badass cops . He is a tortured soul , refusing to be seen as a hero of World War II , previously decorated of the US Army 's highest distinction for defending his regiment against Japan soldiers . Shortly after beginning his police career , Detective Phelps will come across crimes of all sorts , from homicide to arson , including working on famous cases such as the Black Daliah . Phelps will also fight against police corruption , eventually leading him to the game 's main intrigue . So L .A Noire , despite looking like a videogame , has an accessory gameplay . As a matter of fact , there is an option available in the menu to skip live action sequences (of gameplay ), which might be a sign that Team Bondi wasn 't willing to develop a traditional video game at first . Unlike standard sandbox games , the game mechanics are not numerous and are rather straightforwarded . Let 's list some of them , starting with the most interesting one : 1- Interrogation gameplay Team Bondi created something very original with the development of their own facial technology , which is by far the most impressive one I 've ever seen . Team Bondi 's new technology allows you to read the witnesses ' faces for in-depth interrogations , with 3 options to choose from for each question : A ) Truth : facial expressions revealing selfconfidence . The person will not appear agitated . B ) Doubt : Nervous face . Seems concerned and / or agitated . C ) Lie : Same as B , but backed up with a proof found earlier . By choosing the appropriate answers , you 'll get more intel for your investigation eventually leading you to solve your case . 2- Point & click crime scene This is usually where you gather more of your proofs and datas ; search bodies , wallets or objects . This type of gameplay requires no mechanics at all considering the clues are popping up automatically when searching . 3- Driving & chases Some people might say that L .A. Noire 's car driving is a disaster , but really that 's just how the cars physics used to be in the 40s ; you 've got to brake ahead of time because disc brakes were not much existent . Throughout the game there 's plenty enough of police chases . After hours spent from travelling to point A to B in a giant map (which you can skip by letting your partner drive ), a classic police pursuit feels refreshing . 4- Gunfights Although it 's not the title 's main attribute , gunfights are greatly welcome , especially after a long time searching for clues . With a very limited choice of weapons and only a cover mode to interact , don 't expect anything in particular . Its gunfights aren 't renewing anything that has been done before , they are rather extremely classic in their game design . 5- Tailing In some cases you are required to tail , in car or on foot . Again here it 's extremely classic ; you follow and keep a distance . 6- Looting : cars and historic areas Just like collecting items in GTA , here you are asked to find collection cars , amongst an impressive selection of 90-100 REAL cars that actually existed , from Chevrolet to Cadillac . You will also scan around 20 historic areas of Los Angeles , similar to Assassin 's Creed . That 's it pretty much when it comes to gameplay . As I said earlier , Team Bondi 's title stands more as a movie in the form of a game , than an actual video game , clearly . Maybe now you 're thinking " I 'm a fan of noir movies , but this looks very bad after reading ." As mentioned above , the gameplay is the LEAST important thing . If , and I really say IF , you are a cinema purist , then L .A. Noire is for you . + State of the art narration + Revolutionnary facial motion-capture + Authentic interrogation gameplay + Story up-par with some of the best Noir movies of all time , including Taxi Driver and L .A. Confidential + 40 's Los Angeles restituted like nothing else before + Great research on history + 100 real cars from the 40s + Amazing actors + Badass main protagonist : Cole Phelps + Art direction - Game design extremely too classic - Technically sub-par - Gameplay serves as a cheap fill in - Empty open-world - The lack of mission diversity makes L .A. Noire quickly boring - Low replay value - Developed mostly for a niche

This game is so great that it convinced me to do so . overall I give this game an 9/10 Pros : -Moderate Replay value -Full customization of characters (after certian points in the story ) -Multiple endings -Lovable characters -Fast flowing combat -Almost all weapons have different attack combos and special attacks (I say this not having tried all the weapons , as far as I know they all are different ) -Gear upgrading (This especially delighted me , as it means you can pick a certian look for your character and not be forced to give up that look whenever you find better gear ) =Crossdressing (not my thing at all , but hey , it 's an option !) -Name used in game (not voiced , but still cool to see it in dialogue and chitchat out in the streets ) -Hilarious references (many references to video games and animes ) -Real life stores represented in game -Incredibly accurate recreation of a japanese town -Incredibly immersive story (Kept me wanting more ) -Completionist love (with an encyclopedia of weapons , tops , bottoms , underwear , headgear , animations , accesories , characters , nicknames , skills , and flyers to unlock , a completionist like me will continue to pour hours into this game ) Cons : -Anticlimactic endings (so far in my opinion the only endings worth getting are Shizuku 's and Rin 's) -No love for Kati (would have loved a path to romance her and her quirky ways ) -Almost impossible to play without a controller (combat buttons are linked to the mouse by default , but on screen prompts still display xbox controller buttons , making strip combos confusing and hard to achieve . -Limited partner system (can only parter up with around five characters , some of them are even given visual weapons that never get used . I would love to go patrolling with some of the guys in the story , but alas , I can 't have my every wish .) -Abrupt end (this ones more personal . Really endings just end with a confession of love and then ... that 's it .) -Character development (this ones another one thats just a personal pet peeve . You really don 't get to know a character until AFTER you 've made half the choices to lead down thier path .) Comments : This game is absolutely amazing . It was well worth the purchase and then some . This game (wouldn't get away with but ) is deserving of a $50 pricetag . I just wanted the story to keep going , and was resultantly dissapointed when it ended , but I just started over and went through a different amazing storyline .)

It 's not quite like anything else , which is extremely hard to find these days since pretty much everything has already been done one way or another . The universe is quite complex , the text is good , the characters fairly well built and developed . Really good job . Visually , although it 's pixel-art (and I 'm not a huge fan of it ) you can see the amount of work they put into this game -- there are lots of animations , many different characters , a rather large number of unique locations and several different GUI elements . Puzzle-wise , Technobabylon is on the easy side . Only one thing , at the end of the game , was hard to figure out ... or , rather , to spot . Great idea on this one , though . There are a good number of optional achievements to be done , and some of your choices will have an impact on the long-term story , or at least in the current scene 's development . You won 't always see it coming , so save more often than you usually would -- because you 'll most likely have to reload a few minutes back more than once . In short : ++ for the story / writting , + for the amount of work put into the game (specially considering it was essentially done by 2 or 3 guys ) and ... a - for the puzzles , since I 'm a fan of getting stuck in these games and going to sleep trying to figure out what to do next . Technobabylon lasts only 8 hours or so , but it 's worth it .

13587,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nathanielquiet/recommended/306880,nathanielquiet,306880,This is the worst table I own . It appears to be completely random and the ball doesn 't flow or react to the flippers as well as other tables . The ramps are stupidly placed and the ball movement is either too fast or slows quickly for no reason . There are loads of better tables for Pinball fx2 and I would purchase them before getting this . Much as I appreciate Deadpool as a Marvel character (and the use of all four flippers which this wastes !) this table lets him down ... the Wolverine table is ten times better ! Poor design 3/10

Where a single hit kills , spending more time running back to the boss than the amount of time you faced it becomes annoying quickly . A bit of back story would have been nice .

I feel like being a bartender now because of this game . The sound track is graet and it keeps you calm and relaxed when you play . The game also feels like a anime to me (well it is a visual novel ) and I like that type of stuff however the game also goes on the side of fan service not huge fan service here that is not the games focaus IMO . I recommend this game to anyone who wants to start out with a visual novel .

Likeable characters , amusing dialogue , plenty of easter eggs . *Good puzzles ? Check . They 're all logical enough to solve without a guide but challenging enough to provide that little bit of satisfaction when you solve them . Obviously your mileage may vary , as some people are going to be much better or worse at solving puzzles than I am , but those people can write their own reviews . *Good music ? Check . It 's not exactly Bach , but it provides the right general ambience , doesn 't get too annoying and fits well into the background . *Decent length ? Check . There are nine cases (after solving the first six , turn on the bonus cases in the options menu ), which according to Steam took me about 8 hours total to solve (discounting time spent in menus and what-have-you ). Not bad for a ?7.69 (inc. VAT ). In summary , this is everything I could have wanted it to be and I eagerly await the sequel (now fully funded on Kickstarter ). EDIT : Forgot to mention , the first two cases are avaliable for free on Kongregate , so you can go and play those first as a demo to see if you 're into it .

13607,https://steamcommunity.com/id/skidrowtrash/recommended/928840,skidrowtrash,928840,Cybarian is a neat action platformer where you 're a time travelling barbarian and you teleport into a cyberpunk style future and have to kick some butt . I has solid gameplay that feels great on the 360 style PC controller and is very responsive . The game is based a lot on timing , not just for your attacks but also for dodging boss attacks and the platforming . It 's not the longest game ever but it 's good and for the price it 's alright . First Impressions / Gameplay Video <url> -- > Follow My Steam Curator Here <-- The combat is simple there is an up-to 3 hit combo you can pull off by swinging the sword with the right timing . You later unlock a couple other moves which are helpful and required for certain situations and they make things feel fresh until the end . The music was great and I really liked the sound effects . There were multiple times where I was sure I heard some of these in Streets of Rage , like the same sound effects or very close to them . Also there is a bit of a sonic sound at parts , it all feels and sounds very clasic retro 16bit style and it 's great . The game is hard but not overly hard , although it can be punishing because there are no checkpoints in the levels . You have unlimited lives which is nice and after beating a level or getting to a boss you restart there if you die so that 's cool too . This is the kind of game that feels just like a classic 16Bit era game and it feels like it when playing too . I would recommend this to anyone who loves retro gaming and can 't get enough of it . There is a lot of trial and error because certain things you won 't be expecting and then suddenly they hit you , but because of how the game is designed everything is in the same locations and the timing is the same so you could do speed runs with this game and make a bit of a competition out of it . It 's good , there are a few issues but nothing overly harsh . There was one instance where I fell through the floor in the part of level 2 where the lava is dropping and I fell endlessly until I restarted the game but other than that I haven 't had any issues . At one point I did have some problems , my character would occasionally run in a certain direction and it would cause me all sorts of frustration . I 'm not sure if it 's game related though because I unplugged my 360 style PC controller and put in my other 360 style PC controller , restarted the game and had no problems . This is definitely a cool , short , action platformer game with nice pixel art , music and sound effects that feel very much like it 's staight out of the 90 's.

The game provides features such as : Equipping and upgrading different weapons and armour Leveling up to upgrade your survivor stats Gathering resources to build barricades and defend against the horde . Fighting against various types of zombies Offers 3 different survivor classes to choose from : soldier , medic and engineer which has 3 unique skills each . Several game modes are fully functional with 3 difficulty levels . Due to the fact that this game is still in Early Access , the story mode with an expanded map outside is still in development . Pros : + Trading cards + Achievements (planned) + Excellent team of developers who constantly update the game Cons : - Only playable in single player - Instruction guide which pops up are annoying (might be because of my limited ability ) - Early in access still , not fully complete Conclusion : Promising elements of a very good Real Time Strategy and Role Playing Game . I definitely recommend this game to anyone that is , a fan of zombie survival games or zombies in general and looking for a game they can enjoy for a long time .

Yes , the first two are at odds from the very start until credits roll . The boating : wonderful ! Calming when slow , exciting when fast , responsive and intuitive . Also recommended : LoZ Wind Waker . The climbing : tedious and simple , think early Uncharted . The scenery doesn 't do much when you 're constantly looking at the wall in front of your face ; you 're climbing on crumbled handholds dozens of metres above jagged concrete but the only thing you do when a hand slips is roll your eyes and wait for the extra seconds to be over . Recommend instead : Grow Home , I Am Alive . The exploration : pretty neat on sea , utterly tedious depth-first trudging on land & wall , you don 't even really get to scope manually . Recommended instead : Astroneer , Grow Home . The relaxing : disturbed somewhat by the need to bandage a big bleeding gash and find food & water for a dying child . Recommended instead : EarthTounge , Astroneer , Engare . The caring : purely done in cutscenes other than the actual gathering wich consists of exploration , climbing and boating . Recommended instead : I don 't know ! Would love a tip :) The Story : nothing you haven 't heard before , told in no new way . Recommended instead : Bound , Gorogoa . I bought it on sale for 2 $ and it was still hardly worth it .

13616,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MarkDarkness/recommended/49520,MarkDarkness,49520,I never expected to get into this game as much as I did . I expected to make a casual run with one character and call it a day , yet here I am , 100 hours later on single player . Interesting enough , the element that a lot of reviews highlight , which is the writing , doesn 't gel with my tastes at all . If you consider it to be good writing going through a never-ending stream of jokes where the punchline is always killing or torturing someone , then please guffaw away , but what actually caught my attention was everything else . It can 't be overstated how amazing the artstyle is , and the overall feeling of the world benefits a lot from the comic book aesthetics . There is also an interesting sense of space that is neither one of those endless worlds nor a constrained space , reaching a good balance between both . The gameplay loop is very tight , and the player always feels compelled to find something to do . Level scaling is not a mechanic I usually appreciate , but here it actually works quite well . Just remember to only accept missions when you are actually going to do them , because the acceptance is what scales the mission , no matter when you complete it . Combat feels fun and mostly skill-based , weapon variety is of course off the charts , and there is enough reason to both conserve some of your equipment and switch part of it all the time . I guess this kind of synthesizes the main quality of the game : balance . It is fun enough to run though the campaign multiple times , but what I found to be a blessing on my second run was to simply disable voices and let go of the so-called witty dialogue . The game felt much faster and more interesting to me . Your mileage may vary .

13620,https://steamcommunity.com/id/southrobin/recommended/287980,southrobin,287980,A calming train track management game that gets more frantic as it goes on . 8/10 Pros : + Beautiful minimalist style + Easy to pick up + Different modes and maps + Calming if you play endless mode + Came cheaply in a humble bundle ($1) + Makes you interested in real train map styles to improve your own maps + CIRCLES Cons : - Hard to master (over 1000 , 1500 people ) - Some scenarios are a bit unfair . (Eg 6 islands on Stockholm , with only 5 bridges ? No option to get more in my playthrough .) - Sometimes the passengers get impatient a little too easily . - CIRCLES Overall : 8 / 10 , would circle again .
13621,https://steamcommunity.com/id/heybabyxxx/recommended/230070,heybabyxxx,230070,This is an ambitious game and there are several things that I admire in it , but unfortunately it left me disappointed . Maybe it 's a case of ¡°it's not you , it 's me ¡±, because I was expecting a more traditional cRPG . What I got instead was basically a visual novel (a well written one , at least ), since combat was not advised in a first playthrough and I built a character according to that . The greatest problem was that I kept facing hindrances to the advancement of the plot : normally , a spot in which I had to have stats high enough for not failing a conversation or to fight enemies that were stronger , better equipped and in great number . This led to a back-and-forth through the world , until I had more experience to overcome these obstacles ; that would not have been so bad if the stages were beautiful or at least interesting and fun to explore . In the end , I was limited by a few of these impossible situations and my game came to a halt before the end . Incredibly frustrating . And now I 've no will of beginning again ; maybe someday I 'll give it another shot . In conclusion , this is a ¡°maybe¡±. Since you may very well like it , as many other people do , I recommend that you play the demo first . I should 've done that , but the game 's descriptions and the reviews convinced me that this would be just right up my alley ¡­ Anyway , I 'll try ¡°Dungeon Rats ¡± eventually and will keep an eye on this studio , because I see potential for better games _ if it manages to balance challenge and enjoyment ; I 've no qualms about hard games , but they must be fun to play .

Oddly , it 's the story that 's surpassed expectations here (excluding the still dire effort in the included Vergil 's Downfall DLC )-not because it was ever bad , but it was always overshadowed by the stellar combat . Playing through it again , though , it 's amazing to see just how ambitious and , at times , rather clever , it is . Let 's not forget that , as a series . Small plot holes and a few heavy-handed moments of satire aside , DmC 's story does a great job of crafting a foreboding atmosphere to back up its action , especially when coupled with the excellent voice acting and effortless dialogue .

Swords , Murder , Revenge , and a girl in a motercycle helmet . Good music , nice artstyle , and addicting gameplay . The combat takes some getting used to but once you understand it you can cake walk the rest of the game EXCEPT the last level . On the Negative Side only putting ONE checkpoint on the last level was horrible . You have to complete the longest level in the game without making a mistake ? That was a {?} move .

13636,https://steamcommunity.com/id/little_caesar/recommended/335670,little_caesar,335670,Simply put : An underrated gem . LISA is an rpg with dark humor , dark themes and at least one dark cave . You 're Brad Armstrong , a beaten and scarred , both physically and mentally , martial arts instructor who has to make some serious decisions . There 's JOY , a drug that makes you forget all the pain but should you really use it ? There 's people to rescue and / or to kill . There 's people to recruit and sacrifice . The game doesn 't really pull any punches . It keeps throwing disturbing events at you and it 's up to you how you take it . I get most of the jokes and find the game brilliant but some will definitely find it repulsive . This is one of those games that I will remember for a long time and something I just might go back to . Just to breathe in the good kind of weird . edit : I went in blind , picked the hard mode , didn 't use the drugs and boy was it a wild ride now that I 'm through . I suggest playing on normal though , since the game can be a bit on the edge at times , especially with some of it 's bosses .

13652,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mramazing3/recommended/912460,mramazing3,912460,So my dudes , it 's finally here , fighting road , and after that long wait and multiple let downs it has finally been released , and here 's a few thoughts . So the main selling point is fighting road , and at the minute I have spent around 2 hours on it and only just made my debut , it is incredibly long (I'm on about 2% completion .) and I 'm excited to play it , FIRE PRO FINALLY HAS A STORY AGAIN !! The included wrestlers are all brand new , with new edit parts that can be used on custom wrestlers and all look as close as you 're going to get to the real thing , with some new moves and all the new parts , I know I am very excited to start making more CAWs again with all these new additions . There is also the updated menu , voice lines for all the NJPW wrestlers which again CAWs can use and the addition of run ins for matches , great for if you are running a company and trying to make convincing rivalries like many of us are . Overall for the ?15 I paid for this I think it is worth it , I 've had no technical issues so far and with over 200 hours in the base game alone this is a very refreshing and very welcome change of pace , finally putting some meat on what was fun , but a little bare . I 'm going to have so much fun with CAWs

(" Since I cried so server that time , how were I cured ? HOW WERE I CURED " ) - Options for auto-play lacking , it 's sooo slow even set to max speed ( 25 char / s ). I read faster than a 4th grader thanks . Honestly , if you can handle the god-awful translations , it 's probably worth it for the low price . For me , they ruined it which is why I can 't recommend it .
13654,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SpudLordOfAllPotatoes/recommended/440,SpudLordOfAllPotatoes,440,I remember hating this game . It 's weird learning curve , getting mad at players for being too good , Calling out " spawncampers " even though the spawn I was in had two or more exits . Yeah , I was a very , VERY stupid player . But I came to love the game for what it was , and got easily pulled in by its charm . Yes , I 'm still bad at the game , but now I enjoy being bad at the game . What other game lets me conga with up to 31 other random dudes ? What other game gives you a sense of pride for looking as stupid as possible ? What other game actually makes me WANT to throw money at a screen for some stupid hat ? This game . And that 's pretty powerful .
13655,https://steamcommunity.com/id/IAMThePHiLsTeR/recommended/637670,IAMThePHiLsTeR,637670,I beat this game when it first came out and I was only 11 years olds . That being said I have EXTREME nostaligia glasses on . This was my very first rpg and it is what got me hooked on rpgs to this day . Therefor , this review is completely nullified for any newcomers lol . For people with nostaligia glasses on , this game IS secret of mana and this remaster did not destroy it . Only negative I consider is the new soundtrack which is souless artificial crap . The sound settings allow you to switch back to the original , thankfully . It has the same mechanics and story as the original with the following enhancements : Updated graphics Full voice Added cutscenes Quality of life improvements Additional banter segments when sleeping at inns Quality of life improvements include : 2 shortcuts to weapons and spells Quest page that reminds you what you need to do next Controllable 360 dashing Mini-map at top right cornor of screen For all the negative reviews , people just can 't be pleased when it comes to classic games . This happens so often . Why don 't they just play the original then {?} Jesus . If you don 't compare each game with magnifying glasses and take this remaster for what it is , you 'll be pleased . Only real negative is its price at $40. $30 would have been the sweet spot .

13657,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gone_oh/recommended/493340,gone_oh,493340,*UPDATE* (1/4/2017) Game still runs like absolute doody . Seems like it is a lot more prevalent in the discussions as well . Maybe one day ... *UPDATE* (11/25/2016) Unfortunately ended up refunding this . Hopefully when I look back into it in a couple months all the kinks will be worked out . Here 's hoping you have better luck than I did if you buy this . ---Original Review--- Of the 1 ,500 user reviews for this game less than 50 are negative . That should tell you something right there . It really is quite something , this is to RollerCoaster Tycoon what Cities Skylines is to Sim City . I 'm giving it a negative review because of the performance issues the game is having . Given the overwhelmingly positive reception Planet Coaster is receiving you may not notice just how many people are having performance issues . Check the Steam discussions and you will see people with i7s , 32gb ram , and gtx 1070s being unable to achieve a stable 30fps ON AN EMPTY PARK . Meanwhile you will also see people getting stable fps over 40 with i5s , 8gb ram , and gtx 970s on loaded parks with over a thousand guests . Personally , I can 't even run the game at 1920x1080 on lowest settings and get much more than a semi-stable 20fps . This is an improvement though ; just yesterday in the beta I was barely getting 15fps . I have faith that Planet Coaster will receive some more optimizations . When that day comes I will definitely update this review . Until then , buyer beware . It 's really hit or miss that you 'll be able to run this game .

13667,https://steamcommunity.com/id/skullburn/recommended/203810,skullburn,203810,First , this is not " A Game " as we ussaly called a game . The control reside on mouvement and mouse look . That 's all . No intereaction , jump , fight , switch , etc . But don 't be fool , it 's a great game of exploration , narration , and the music is really good in is genre . A playtrought is appoximatively 1h30 , but some narration seems random and you wont get all of them in one playtrought . It is said on the internet that it take 6 playtrought to get all . The first 30 minute of the game are weird , but give you time to adjust to that kind of game , and it will be awesome .

I 'm very picky about arpgs and little is needed to make me not play a game . This one has everything - 4 classes with multiple skill trees , skill variations and modifiers to choose - cool loot (rare, unique , sets , legendary etc ) that you can enchant , socket , transmute , reroll , gamble , etc . - graphics that is pleasant to the eye (and I generally don 't like pixel art ) with very cool skills effects and monster special attacks - can be played using a controller (I love it ) or wsad + keyboard - combat is very satisfying - very customizable interface - the dev named Squarebit answers all your questions on forums and listens to the community . And more - minions , waypoints , shrines , multiple difficulties , randomly generated levels , some kind of rifts (haven't reached it yet though ). So much fun for so little money .

So we can chalk this product up as edumacational , at the very least . I 'm not sure if it 's informative or engaging enough for the price they 've slapped on it , but it 's well worth a watch for anyone interested in indie game development , if and when you can find it on sale . As someone who 's watched a lot of stuff about WESTERN indie game development , it certainly gives a slightly different perspective . And come prepared for subtitles , suffice it to say , if you don 't happen to speak the Japanese language . Verdict : 7.5/10.

13676,https://steamcommunity.com/id/HaitianVacation/recommended/276810,HaitianVacation,276810,Who among you shall die today ? Those are the words which are often said after the main menu loads . You should prepare ..... Mordheim is a turn based tactical combat game . The goal of the game is to start off as a rag tag bunch of mercenaries and survive the city of the damned leveling up , obtaining new gears , new skills , and new heroes along the way . This game isn 't for the casual feel good gamer however . During your journey to survive you 'll have set backs such as permanent injuries and deaths . Don 't get too attached to a character because as Murphy 's Law states " ANYTHING THAT CAN GO WRONG , WILL GO WRONG " . That is where the RNG comes into play . Every action has a chance to fail or go wrong , but this also means it can also go well and work out in your favor . In Mordheim everybody submits to the RNG Gods ... Although there are faction specific campaigns with their own unique maps , generally most time will be spent on side mission which are randomly generated . Everything in the game has a point rating from the lowest quality white dagger to the sum of a maxed out level 10 hero character with all gear spots full . This total determines your active warband rating and although campaign missions have a static rating allowing you to play them as a higher rating , random missions will always have around the same rating as you and your warband composition . This means every mission is as balanced as possible with no funny business , because let 's be honest , there is enough funny business when RNG occurs . You may fight the same faction as your warband or different factions , but rest assured they 'll look and act differently . The city of Mordheim although grim and dark may appear very similar , maps are randomly generated . This means obstacles , walls , traps , loot points , stones , and time of day all change between missions . Difficulty ranges from normal to deadly with the possible rewards in volume of stones and items present increasing , but this also increases the chance of being ambushed , ambushing , or having chaos demons present on the map which attack randomly . Mordheim is all about risk vs reward . Visually the game isn 't that impressive , but not bad either . There are faction specific variations for all items in the game from swords to basic helmets . A white grade helmet is going to look vastly different on a Skaven than a Witch hunter for example . Beyond that there are numerous other visual options available for each character including numerous color options . Using a SweetFX profile to increase color vibrance and sharpness is recommended . The user interface although different than most games works well and is convenient . This isn 't a typical mouse driven top down or isometric control scheme . Instead you use WASD to move characters like an action game then A and D to select actions and confirm with a mouse click . Pressing spacebar opens a half circle radial menu in which you can view different actions / skills / stance for more information if you wish . Hotkeys revolve around displaying the combat log window , buffs / debuffs , and character stats . Before you take an action whether it 's trying to jump across buildings or stab a bad rat there is a success percentage displayed with most factors compiled and displayed on screen showing exactly how that end success chance is calculated . It is a difficult game . You have to play the tutorials and come to realize bad things will happen , but the point of the game is adjusting and continuing on . It 's one of my all time favorite games because it 's so unique and has enough variation and content to keep players interested for hundreds of hours . Multiplayer exists and you can either play for keeps resulting in permanent injury / death like the single player game or choose exhibition in which there are no permanent punishment or rewards . Whichever way you decide to play there is no save scumming (reloading because things didn 't go your way ) and results are permanent . You can play a warband forever if you want . After you complete the campaign you can continue playing . Here is a listing of that content and the vast amount of options that make it so re-playable . This includes all DLC . 5 playable Warbands with 39 unique characters . Each character has 1 or more passive unique starting perks . All characters can have up to 6 skills and up to 6 passive perks . Casters can have 6 unique spells as well . All spells , skill abilities , and passive perks have 2 levels . 59 available passive perks for each character + 3 unique faction specific perks . 61 active skill abilities + 3 unique faction specific skill abilities . 8 unique faction spells to use by casters . 10 additional unique abilities for each DLC character (Poison Wind Globadier and Smuggler ) Veteran system that unlocks and rewards more benefits the longer you play and complete tasks . 12 veteran ranks with 149 total tasks to complete . Each rank rewarding you with different rewards . 3 factions with 5 reputation levels each you can obtain further rewards from . 9 stat point categories to distribute points while you increase in level for all characters . 6 gear spots for all characters and up to 6 inventory spots for consumables . 19 unique permanent injury possibilities . 14 unique book / tome / grimore items to further increase stats on characters beyond leveling . Active warbands can take up to 10 characters at once during missions . You can unlock 8 additional reserve character spots for characters . 8 unique campaign missions per faction with a total of 40 campaign missions . .
13677,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gozbyn/recommended/221910,gozbyn,221910,This game is amazing . It is different almost every time you play it , and you can always come back to it . I highly recommend playing this game . You shouldn 't keep reading reviews , and you definitely shouldn 't look for gameplay in question of whether to buy it . The less you know about the game before starting , the better your experience will be .
13678,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Commissar_Jimbo/recommended/884660,Commissar_Jimbo,884660,Good proof of concept , and would be nice to see them bring this mode of Infantry Combat into War Thunder - however , the aiming feels slow and inaccurate aswell as doesnt have impact or punch making all guns feel like pea-shooters that do no damage . The main menus itself are kinda ugly - the 'cloud' loading screen actually hurts my eyes . Its pretty dime-of-the-dozen , doesnt add much other then show what could be done for War Thunder . Nothing Special .
13679,https://steamcommunity.com/id/howieantonio/recommended/367080,howieantonio,367080,This is an extremely fun game the controls are simple and done right ( you can map them yourself . The mechanics for the on screen items was really nice but switching items from the menu was a little awkward but you get used to it . As for gameplay and fighting its very responsive and tight controls which works with the kind of game this is . The pixel are of this game is really nice and well done . The music is something I really enjoyed , the tune feels like something adventurous and makes you want to play more . The story is something interesting i do wish the game was slightly longer but the progression with the dungeons didn 't feel repetitive every area was completely different . Overall i highly recommend this game

Although I have noticed the " secrets " are random , it 's still a nice touch .

That is , of course , assuming you aren 't dead before you push that screenshot button . The game feels pretty brutally hard at first and I can tell I have a lot of hours to go , but it controls well , looks fantastic , and is one of the few modern 3D arcade space shooters out there . The roguelike might turn some people off , and I think a linear version of the game could have been great , but it is what it is and persistant upgrades can help ease the pain of dying all the time to everything that isn 't a bandit drone .

Examples : Sound only plays voice . No ambient , no music , no vehicle sounds . UI does not display messages , but it still collects them until some event clears the blockage and you get 500 messages . Which is nice . The list continues : - permanent fire bug - wrong map symbol (rare) Positives : Australia is a wild place mate . I can hear the thunder . Only game I know that takes place in Australia . And I imagine it to be this hellish wasteland where everyone wants and can kill you . I am really impressed by the clean design choice to associate the colour red with non-counterable . If you see red-flash it 's a sniper , you can 't block his bullet . If you see a red symbol above a combatant you know he will charge you , you can 't block his charge . Well done . Also this game is a man-simulator . You hunt , you gather , you become the alpha male . Very attractive . I am atracted to men it 's so confusing .

My favorite Insurgency joke ;) This is a very promising project , it already works fine despite being in Early Access , Insurgency really delivers some intense first person combat action . Strategy and teamwork are absolutely essential if you actually want to win a single round in this game . A nice example that communication really is key . The integrated voice system influences the gameplay and is a great idea that we hopefully see more often in the future .

13711,https://steamcommunity.com/id/noestringfound/recommended/759220,noestringfound,759220,Wonderfully surreal platformer , such a unique experience . Almost instantly the game has an immersive atmosphere between the music and cinematic presentation . And it rapidly builds up a very dream like world which is just steeped in intricate , reflective cynical dialogue . From a story telling perspective it really is just unparalleled how perfect the surreal atmosphere is and how consistent it remains . And the simple but unnaturally colour coordinated environments really helps to hold it together . The gameplay itself is responsive , simple and fun to control . It has quirks with the ledge grab being too sensitive and the block not being used much but otherwise it 's well polished . There 's only a couple frustrating moments to the gameplay beyond that it maintains a balanced and persistent level of challenge . If anything it 's too long , as at two to three hours the atmosphere does start to wear off the longer the gameplay sequences drag on and the charm of the surreal dialogue begins to fade . But still so much value for only a couple dollars and the world it builds is just incredible .

If you played the old one on PS2 a little has changed with regards to the licences , I would advise maybe looking some stuff only as they 've now gone with more of a traditional Final Fantasy style job system with these boards . Works great though . Overall , I love it . This was always one of my favourites as a kid , and it 's great to be able to replay it with some modern conveniences and graphics .

13739,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fr0sent_Lucifer/recommended/217980,fr0sent_Lucifer,217980,Steampunk theme , stealth , if desired frontal collision with enemies , a small part of the RPG system . In the game itself , there is very , very much research . You can just run through the game without noticing , enjoy the gameplay and stay happy . And you can go deep and feel it completely . Danwall is a simple city . Here people live in their apartments , collect paintings , lock valuable things in safes . The city feels alive not only for this . Here you can stumble upon all sorts of situations . You can protect the girl from corrupt guards . You can see the quarrel of bandits who did not share the profit . Or guards who kill their partner , because of suspicion of infection . Despite all the skepticism , it turned out to be a wonderful game . Many were waiting for a great stealth , with the option to join the fray , and the output received an elaborate game . The same stealth flavored action , with its exciting and lively world , where there is always something necessarily happens .
13740,https://steamcommunity.com/id/peppage/recommended/609490,peppage,609490,Amazing game , I had so much fun playing . I don 't normally want to get lost or have to deal with puzzles like this but knowing the solution is only ever 1 minute away changes everything . Now I know going in one direction has a limit , I can 't get too lost . I loved figuring this game out and exploring the world . The characters are fun to meet and interact with . Each puzzle had a great solution . This is a special indie game I recommend strongly .
13741,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kmcbride/recommended/358750,kmcbride,358750,The sequel to " Sunrider : the Mask of Arcadius ." This game plays much the same as the first title , but with mild updates to the battle system . The battle system still feels a little sluggish since it 's running through the RenPy visual novel engine , but it 's still serviceable . The scenario is a direct continuation of the first title , and the plot does change slightly through the player 's choices at the beginning of the game . While Mask of Arcadius had sparse English voice acting during its battles , Liberation Day - Captain 's Edition has full Japanese voice acting through the entirety of the main game 's events . The voice acting is well done , but I do wish they would have tried to refine their methods of English voice acting- we can always use more good English voices in visual novels . Still , their determination to create a full experience is exceptional , and I appreciate the effort they put in . Unlike the first game , once the ending for this game plays , an additional mode is unlocked . Titled " [RE]turn," the player is given the chance to play through an additional story reliving events that happen through the game 's plot . This elevates a " choose your own adventure " choice style for the visual novel- there are no battles to strategize in [RE]turn, only choices . The decisions you make will determine whether you get a good ending or a bad ending , and there are many endings , so there 's plenty of replayability . If you enjoyed Mask of Arcadius (which is still FREE ), it 's likely you will also enjoy Sunrider : Liberation Day . Definitely use that game as a litmus test before any purchases .

Along with new additions like the hard exploration mode and the immersive mode , it was hard to pass up and I 'm glad I didn 't . It 's a much more thoughtful and restful experience , punctuated by well designed bursts of action that outstay their welcome . The game very much rewards exploration and it can be both relaxing and thrilling . If you don 't want a more exploratory experience with an interestingly developed world , I would definitely say this game is not for you . But for a balance between the original games and the first game in this modern series , with great writing and an atmosphere that makes you feel like the even more Indiana Jones-type this version of Lara Croft has become , I emphatically recommend this game . There are some missteps such as the aquatic piranha stealth , but they don 't fully undermine the experience . TLDR ; 8.75/10 , +Exploration -Combat Frequency

Unless maybe you 're one of those nitpicky types that gets very angry over small details that differ slightly from reality but leave you unable to enjoy a game like this . I on the other hand belong to the group of people that like to zone out listening to your favourite music from the early 2000s doing something repetitive and very irrelevant . And this game really is perfect for that . Admittedly it comes without the music but you can somehow bring it in the game via a fancy radio feature or just leave your music-player open in the background . Soon you 'll find yourself on the road letting your mind wander ¨C I can absolutely recommend this game ! On a slightly different note writing a game review for a virtual internet badge should really make one reconsiders one 's life priorities .

13780,https://steamcommunity.com/id/HaitianVacation/recommended/311290,HaitianVacation,311290,The biggest attraction of this game is that it 's made for the PC and not just some multi platform paid DLC by the numbers modern game . That is instantly apparent when you load it up . This game launched without a ridiculous season pass or any mention of paid DLC . There is no horrid crafting that now plagues seemingly every game in existence . This game is like a time capsule when games were made by gamers and everything wasn 't designed for paste eating illiterate console gamers . The UI is stylish and uses the whole screen . You actually get an inventory and sorting features and you don 't have to click 15 times to bring up a comparison between gear . There are no nerdy data logs sitting everywhere explaining the lore of how elves take a dump in the woods . There are things you can read if you want but these are interesting or relevant to where they are such as a note from a dead person next to their corpse . It 's not some primer on the organization of the ruling council of the nerd kingdom you 'll never come across in the game . This brings up one of the greatest strengths on this game as it doesn 't try to overwhelm you with nerd lore . Dialogue makes sense and isn 't boring nerd explanations . This is made even better by the excellent voice acting in which you won 't be cringing over even if the character is swearing . Did I mention that The White Wolf himself is one of the main character voice ? That doesn 't hurt either . I like this game . It reminds me of the good old days of PC gaming where everything wasn 't designed around trying to limit players to spend more money . I don 't feel the need to rush through the game or overthink the mechanics of the game . I can load it up , feel like I 'm in a fantasy world , and care about the story because your not trying to do 15 different fetch quests to get 10 pig butts in order to craft a shield . Good old PC RPG game . There is loot . No tedious crafting . Numerous different enemies based around traditional fantasy tropes . When you buy and sell things at a merchant the UI is simple and straight forward . You can compare items easily and there is only one currency . The game isn 't a pretentious nerd fest is what I 'm saying . If you like fantasy RPG games you 'll probably like this . The RTS elements isn 't the main focus of the game and the campaign doesn 't just plop you on maps to destroy the other side to proceed to the next map .
13781,https://steamcommunity.com/id/4nt3k/recommended/107200,4nt3k,107200,Great game Worth every hour of playing . If you are into simple not complicated 2D space shooters it 's game for you . There 's a lot of humor mainly in text (unfortunately) but it won 't make this game worse . fully customizable ships . You can equip your ship as you like it : (engines, armor , energy shield , any weapon slot , add-ons , crew ) every ship in this game is different and almost all obtainable so you won 't fly with the same thing until you find the best one easy controls , use WSAD and mouse (Yes you control ship by yourself ) ;] not enough resources , or crew ? No problem destroy UTA , Civilian station . You also don 't have to buy technology from any station , you are the pirate ARRRRRRR :D fight like gladiator with your ship in Bounty Hunters arena I like the zombie infection idea it reminds me Beast from Homeworld : Cataclysm . Overall 9/10

That is where the game lost me . Personally I generally like games that have grind as long as you feel progression , which this game offered little in that sense as everything takes quite some time . On top of that navigating the menus which you 'll be spending a lot of time in is just a chore . There isn 't anything bad about the game , and it will definitely have its longitivity in it if you enjoy the grind and slow progression . However , I did not and can not recommend the game .

13795,https://steamcommunity.com/id/WolfCarnby/recommended/466560,WolfCarnby,466560,Overall it 's a pretty good RTS Game , the building / research system is nice but the combat is awful and frustrating . The only thing you can do is select all your combat unites and attack something . You are unable to create single groups or give them some stances / formations . If you leave them alone they will just fight until they die with the ranges staying in melee and it 's really frustrating if you set up a group with front tanks / rang dds and the rang dds just start getting oneshooted cause the game love to set them at the front of your group . I really enjoyed the campaing and the building / lore system but as soon as you need to start managing bigger fights it 's just frustrating .

As far as shootemups on Steam go this one isn 't terrible but does suffer from enough deficiencies that I can 't recommend it . The resolution is fixed , the developers promote the use of peasant gamepads instead of accepting PC users use mouse and keyboard , and while the graphics are not the worst I 've seen , the developer made a deliberate choice to use retro pixel graphics , despite the game being available in 2015 , where far better graphics capabilities were available to them .

Dead Space 2 continues the story of Dead Space 1 except Isac Clark not stranded on a ship anymore he 's stranded on a space station instead . Even better he suffers from a form of dementia plaguing his mind and threatens to kill him in the form of his old wife Nicole (Lovely isn 't it ). New characters are introduced in Dead Space 2 Nolan Stose who suffers from the same syptoms and dementia Isacc does , Tidman who is a complete dumbass , and Ellie who could be a better waifu for Isacc than Nicole . The horror and gameplay in Dead Space 2 has improved and is much better compared to the original with more horror ( especially scences where Isac 's mind interfers and displays Nicole ), more action , and more Oh {?} moments . There are more suits and more weapons in Dead Space 2 giving players more stuff to experiment and play with . The suits now have special attributes tied to them like 10% more health recieved from health kits and 15% percent more damage with certain weapons . There are even more different kinds of necromorphs to kill and loot from them is obtained by stomping and smashing them (because who dosen 't like that ). The religous group in Dead Space 1 makes a return here with thier own church on the space station and so does the government with their government sector . Dead Space 2 is a better version of the orignal and is a must own for people who have played Dead Space 1. I do not recommend buying this on its own , instead buy the Dead Space 1 & 2 bundle and experience the best of both worlds .

This is a free to play game , which means alot of questionable people log in . People go around spraying porn images , doing sexual role play and the administrators say they can do nothing about that . but if you ask a question about how do the controls work on this steam forum , a group of moderators will attack you and delete your question within an hour . of course , they want you to search for a two year old guide on how to play hidden on page 49 of the forum from last year . These clowns don 't have time to answer a question or take care of hackers and rule breakers but they sure do got plenty of time to complain about how people need to use the search button on the forum . second of all , I said this is a free to play game . What does that mean ? well , it means people without money are likely going to play this . So , who would that be ? let me tell you 7 out of ten times you will meet people from south america and the old soviet block countries around russia . Now , that is not bad , I love diversity , but many times you will log in and everyone is speaking spanish or everyone is speaking russian . It 's funny because I was talking to some guy who told me he was from south america and he was practicing english so he could come study in america and his mother walked in while he was on his mic and started yelling at him to clean his room , that was pretty funny , true story . Now , Is VRchat fun ? sure everyone should experience it . I have a windows mixed reality headset and a PSVR . The PSVR does not work properly with VRchat so don 't waste too much time if you are trying to use one , but the WMR is quite a good deal if you get one on sale . however , don 't go around thinking this game is cheap , HTC gave this company 4 million dollars . Where exactly is that money going ? I couldn 't tell you , but I might guess with such terrible administrators and moderators , they all probably went to vegas .

Boy what a mess that would be . Thankfully , Monaco is 'not' a mess , but rather , a stealth heist game in which you and up to three other thieves band together to plunder the money of a variety of facilities in and around Monte Carlo , everything ranging from Casinos to Hospitals to High Security Prisons , being represented . The game 's two virtues are its deceptive level of gameplay depth , and its humorous design aesthetic . It 's the personality hidden behind the neon pixels that at first attracts one to this game--the perplexingly simple yet expressive character designs go along with the frantic piano ragtime and silly french NPC voices , to be extremely memorable . You 'll laugh as your little colorful lego thief pees in a toilet , wiggles their hands to hack a PC hollywood style , or hugs a wall and takes deep , ragged breaths after being shot--to the accompaniment of bloodied footprints left in their step . And as your little Mr . Pink dies from that one guard who peaks just inside your hiding place to bop you with a wrench , they explode into a neon pink colored skeleton , and the music thuds to an abrupt halt--only for the music to pick up again where it left off , once your fellow criminals put your guts back in (to the sound of hilarious squishing noises ). As for the gameplay , it 's definitely the part that keeps you playing Monaco , long after you 're familiar with its pretty pixel face . On the one hand , you can be a sneaky , super subtle player who never gets caught , never trips a trap , never fires a shot . It can at first be a difficult process to do so , as you 're forced to learn by trial and error (due to the game 's sparse tutorial elements ) how to remain undetected . On the flip side , however , Monaco , unlike some of its compatriots in the sneak-em-up genre , never trips over the hurdle of forced stealth . You can shoot people down in a bloody Scarface-esque machinegun massacre , lure guards and civilians into side areas off patrol and give them a wrench over the head , 40 's femme fatale style , or be a clever bastard , cut the circuit breaker in a particularly well-guarded facility , and just 'camp' the power room subduing guards who come with chloroform , while your (debatably) coordinated teammates do the legwork . In fact , if you 're in a hurry , it can sometimes be better just to run aggressively past NPCs , dodging from cover to cover to avoid security agent machinegun fire , or to climb in a vent duct to escape angry attack dogs who are onto your scent , rather than trying to outstealth them . And as a result of this flexibility , at first , it seems like Monaco will be trivially easy to play and win . But Monaco is a stern teacher , and it knows how to steadily ramp up the difficulty to keep you challenged through around thirty-some different , replayable missions . As you go , new classes and items are introduced to the formula , along with new map features like security-trigger handscans , computer viruses , alarm-triggering ATMs that must be busted open for cash , and more . The game is incredibly flexible in its approach , and each class is nuanced enough to be distinct from its brethren . (The one class I am not personally fond of is the Pickpocket , which tends to encourage reckless , self-serving tactics over cooperation , at lower levels of play experience .) However , the classes are not so distinct that they cannot all perform basic functions like opening a safe , or hacking a PC--it 's just that some classes do these things more efficiently than others . So there will rarely be a point where you play a mission 'exactly' the same as the last time you played it , as you tackle obstacles in a level best suited to whatever class you are playing at the time . Lastly , there 'is' a story to the game , consisting mostly of text dialogue , but which is filled with humor and an actually relatively intriguing plot , fleshing out the personalities and origins of the thieves you play as . The thieves themselves have some pretty charming tics--the Hacker is constantly making references to PC error codes and computer shorthand terminology , the Gentleman is your 'World's Most Interesting Man ', complete with his own little intrigue and espionage plot , the Cleaner is a stoic psychopath who rarely speaks beyond deep heavy breaths , and the Mole has a terse Serbian accent and a Freedom Spoon which he employs with a mixture of bravado and thuggish loyalty . The game does suffer from a poor matchmaking system , which is a bit prone to lag and connectivity issues . Also , the menu options are a bit confusing , and there is one bug with using a controller that prevents mouse usage until your machine is restarted--so if you tend to use a controller for some games , like Gauntlet or Dark Souls , but prefer a mouse and keyboard for Monaco , you may run into complications where your mouse doesn 't want to work to aim guns til you pull a soft reset on your OS . All in all , I give Monaco a thumbs up . There are a lot of visual tweaks that could probably make finding your way in the maps a bit easier , the story could use some accompanying visuals (even if just still scenes ), and the tutorial aspects of the game are sorely lacking even after a custom tutorial map was added--but the game just has so much complexity and charm , that it 's hard not to pick it up from time to time , if you can get past those hiccups long enough to get into the meat of the game . Grab it if you don 't have it , and see if you can 't wrangle some friends into the heist with you on headsets . At worst , it 'll make for an amusing weekend of cartoon criminal hijinx .

The art design and assets are top-notch and reeks W40K out of every orifice . Unfortunately the game itself isn 't anywhere near as polished to the point of frustration . - No dedicated servers . Matchmaker displays no ping or useful information whatsoever to tell you the quality of the host . Oh and if you disconnect , crash or the host leaves you lose all progress / rewards . Not a good combo . - Class information is impossible to find unless you know exactly where to look . In fact there is only one screen that displays what the various class abilities actually do . What screen you ask ? The in-game loadout . Yes , you actually have to start up a match if you want to read about the abilities ! Furthermore this information is poorly displayed . You 'd think you 'd just see the class abilities and their icons and hover the mouse over them or something , right ? No , they 're hidden under some kind of awkward " level up " system . - Rewards are given out in a Lootbox (TM) fashion . Of course , you don 't have to buy them with money or anything but Lootboxes (TM) with a random reward for each level-up is a horrid way to hand out rewards even if you don 't have to pay for it . I 've not gotten a single useful thing for any of the classes I prefer . Woopee . - No Single Player " level replay system " . The campaign features various collectibles and not being able to easily select and replay a beaten Chapter is asenine , quite frankly . You have to start the Campaign over entirely if you miss any of them since the game only has a few save slots and overwrites them with each new Chapter .

13819,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Opal_mine/recommended/333600,Opal_mine,333600,Strictly for seasoned veterans of Grand Strategy games , this game is BRUTALLY difficult . I would recommend watching about 5 or so hours of tutorial videos before starting . You play as Cashew , the worlds most oblivious man who has been sprayed with some kind of ultra pheromone that attracts genetic cat-human hybrids . You must resist these freaks as they advance on you as much as possible , failure to do so will result in the bad ending where our hero Cashew ends up mesmerized by the evil Chocola and Vanilla , who have their way with him . If you think you have the skills to get to the good ending , and appreciate a game where almost every choice results in faliure , then by all means give it a go . However in my 20 hours of playing I have still yet to ward off those mutants , no matter what I do it always seems to result in the bad ending . Good luck !

The game lets you play as 3 characters , Michael a man who wants to retire , Franklin a gangster who wants to live the big life , and Tervor a man who is crazy and is an old friend of Michael who finds out he is alive . The 3 team up and perform certain missions to fufill their goals and their needs ot to help the FIB to keep them alive and out of trouble , the 3 characters have special abilty 's with them , Michael has the abilty which I did not used at all , it can slow down time to get a better aim , Franklin 's abilty is that he can slow down time to get a better grip when driving which is very useful when ity comes to racing and driving as a whole , and Trevor 's is the one I used the most as he can go into a rage that makes him do double the damage and he can tank more hits . When you are not doing missions you can come across the many stranges and freaks throughout Los Santos as they have things for you too do and such . The world if Los Santos is big and there is lots to do in it , you can go biking , buy a boat to ride them , get nice cars and so much more , there is a lot to do in GTYA5 and that is why I like it since the freedom it gives you , hell if you want to go and get the cops on you start a rampage . Now as for online I have played it a bit on PC but I did manage to play a lot of it at a friends house on his Xbox one and it was good on the there but on the PC is another story as there are a lot of hackers and most of the modding is now gone due to Rock Star and Take Two due to legal actions taken on them . All in all GTA5 is a great game single player wise and good mutilplayer when the hackers are not out to ruin your fun and such , I recommend this game to anyone who wants a great open world game and the freedom to do what ever they want in the world of GTA5.

I 've put in plenty of hours , and it seems every play through I discover something new . At times , I do have to look up some strategies like when I needed to figure out how to survive winters , but that 's rare . For the most part , it 's very clear in what you have to do and resources you need to gather to survive for quite a while . For a survival game , this is a lot of fun , and I keep coming back to it .

13825,https://steamcommunity.com/id/spineduke/recommended/242680,spineduke,242680,Nuclear Throne is a top down rogue-like shooter set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland featuring animal mutants as the stars of the show . There is some backstory to be had there , but it 's out of the way once the game starts up . And boy , is there a game to be had . Staple to Vlambeer 's output , the game features hugely satisfying combat - with shots giving out appropriate amounts of screen shake , freeze frames and audio feedback upon pulling the trigger . You 'll learn to love the impact of the shotguns and the sniper like efficiency of the crossbow . The weapons have been given loving amounts of attention , between tweaking , balancing and playtesting there is bound to be something for everyone . The levels themselves are randomly generated , akin to the way Spelunky or other games of that ilk work . You 'll have to navigate through several themed worlds , amassing rads (experience) and weapons along the way . The experience unlocks perks - gameplay perks you 'll have to decide upon , the majority of which can greatly shape your playstyle and tactics . Defensive and offensive options abound for the players who like to play safe or for those who need more risk and reward . You 'll find yourself on one hand (or two if you 're playing Steroids ) wielding increasingly massive amounts of firepower , while coping with the snowballing odds . Bands of enemies become hordes , and you 'll find yourself in pure glee as you lay waste to everything before your eyes . Nothing can stand between you and victory , noth ...oh wait . Death again . The game is hard , and you 'll initially find yourself inching to survive . You 'll have to observe individual enemy behaviors , learn to understand the baiting nature of the game , and capitalize on every bit of terrain on the battlefield . With enough time you 'll find yourself at the Nuclear Throne ...only to loop the game and turn up the difficulty to 11. The game features , single and local co-op action (still WIP ), with dailies to add something to come back to everyday . I await the final release with (fish) baited breath .

13829,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stripstroke/recommended/845070,stripstroke,845070,I 'm a huge fan of Life is Strange and this game fits perfectly into the series , it 's in an odd spot though because technically it 's a spin off , a demo and a prequel to Life is Strange 2. The good well the game looks gorgeous , I 'm honestly unsure if they are using a new engine or not but it seems like they are . Everything looks nice especially the character models . There 's plenty of settings to mess with as usual which is great and I don 't know who they keep hiring but every game tops the music one after another , it 's honestly a treat to listen to the handful of tracks within the game . Playing as Chris has to be the best part of this game though because it 's super charming and it also gives you the chance to interact with a tonne of {?} I don 't even think Life is Strange had this much things to mess around with in one area . The bad the game is give or take 60 minutes or a little more , depending on if you rush it like me for the story or do every single thing the game has to offer . Since this is a demo it 's not a cutscene , story heavy game . It 's more of a play little mini games with side stories which is fine but the ending cutscene was the high point , I would have loved to see more of that . It 's a great take on Life is Strange and someday I hope I see more of this , whether it 's in Life is Strange 2 or it 's own sequel .

13840,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kiggamcg/recommended/384190,kiggamcg,384190,This game is a stunningly beautiful and breathtaking adventure through various underwater environments . The game utilizes the full spectrum of colors across multiple environments , from bright coral reefs to the dark deep sea . It 's a delightful surprise to see what new regions and new sealife you will find next . But what I found most impressive about this game though , was its ability to deliver an interesting story and tell the history of the environment simply through the environment itself . In the beginning , you are just thrown underwater with a quick tutorial of controls but no story is revealed until you go searching for it yourself . The art direction is fantastic in that you learn so much about the background of where you are based on the observations and interactions of your surroundings . This encourages exploration as there 's always something fascinating and magical to find through your journey . The game is short (roughly just an hour or two for one playthrough ), but if you appreciate pretty open-world games , like to explore and find things , looking for a calming but stimulating experience , or even if you 've just always wanted to scuba dive , I definitely recommend this game !

Loaded up fine , was pretty good played two players with Xbox one controllers . The control scheme is great the theme and art style are complimented by a cool soundtrack . but the game crashes on the regular . Sometimes after a minute , sometimes after a full level . One thing you know for sure though is it will crash and when it does it is a bad freeze your PC crash , refuse to close the programme through task-manager crash . Reboot your PC and punish you for thinking you can play the game you paid for type of crash . The crash is confined to this one game , so I know it isn 't my PC . It is a shame but in it 's current state (20/02/2018) it is unplayable without the threat of being booted . 0/10 wouldn 't be forced to restart PC again .

Personally , I really liked this game , although I 'm not very familiar with this genre , the only acquaintance is naturally Alien Shooter , so there 's really nothing to compare me with . Bloody Streets have two big minuses is character customization is completely absent . And the game doesn 't have any story line . The game has a standard set of weapons , namely : two assault rifles , two shotguns , two pistols , and a machine gun . All this opens with the passage of the chapters , here their four . Each chapter has a certain number of cards in which we need to hold out three waves . I dare say that the cards are not boring , the enemy climbing from anywhere so you can 't sit in one place , and you will be have to run . Models of the enemies are very nice to see , especially when you killing the crowds of zombies , it looks very colorful . Of course , if it were not for achievements that are not difficult to knock out , I would probably spend here for an hour or two less . But still , the game was finished , and it was very entertaining to engage in achievement hunting . So I think this game I can recommend for a couple of evenings .

But free look camera on the right thumb stick has been added and it helps out a lot in combat and discovery . My first playthrough it had been some time since I played the previous LoS . I knew the story must take place in a modern / future setting but I had hoped they would find a way around it so it wouldn 't feel corny . In a way they did and it was pretty genius . It did feel a bit corny the first playthrough but after some time and recently replaying through LoS and Mirror of Fate I found much more to be appreciated in LoS2 and enjoyed it quite a lot . Peicing together the story accross the games was a lot of fun as well . There are so few action / adventure games made these days ; and fewer still that are worth playing . The LoS trilogy is quite good and worth owning for fans of the genre . LoS gameplay draws a lot from God of War and some from Shadow of the Colossus with a good sprinkle of classic Metroidvania . The expeience and skill tree system I quite prefer in this game if I am to have one . The moves you use are the ones you gain experience in , as it should be . And gaining experience and leveling your weapons doesn 't take forever . 3 levels for each of the 3 types . I can live with that over leveling to absurd numbers . The DLC is short but appropriate . Playing as Alucard weilding a sword rather than a whip like weapon with reach gives a new flavor to the combat yet remains quite familiar .

Since you 're playing as the Blacksmith , you will find that he isn 't at his forge as well , which is a nice touch from a Roleplaying perspective . It 's a shame you have to grind your way through Insane Mode in order to unlock the other characters . I would not of minded paying the same price , tbh . It 's not like you " win the game " by having each character , so all the grinding proves is that you 're patient .

13896,https://steamcommunity.com/id/skl_andrey/recommended/473560,skl_andrey,473560,First of all , I recommend this game , it 's a great tower defense . The main idea of the game is to travel in space with the ship , and to defend yourself from the enemy ships . The music makes you to feel like you are playing an old school game , awesome soundtrack . You start with only one turret , you can 't pass the first planet without doing some upgrades or buying some new defense guns , lasers , turrets , rocket launchers etc ., and you need some skill , it 's not that easy to hit all the enemy ships and win . The game has some tasks , when you finish the task you get a reward , like energy , money and aluminium so you can upgrade your weapons . It 's addictive , you want to destroy more ships , to get more energy , to travel more , to reach the next planet . Main problem of the game now , it 's that starting with the second half of planet two , the game become a bit unplayable , 5-10fps drops , but the dev is already working on that . Per-total , it 's a great game , addictive , and worth a shot .

13917,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Grey_Guard/recommended/226840,Grey_Guard,226840,This is a pretty solid turn-based strategy game , the different fantasy and RPG elements mix stupendously with the strategic elements . You don 't even have to play the campaign to enjoy this game , you can literally just play custom games for hours upon hours on end , and still really enjoy this game . I personally find it really enjoyable to create my own leaders and heroes , and then play in a customized world , adding some of my imagination and interpretation into the whole playthrough , which is one of the things I like about the custom mode , you can end up creating your own personal lore and story based off of the game itself , though that 's my personal experience anyways . Despite that , after like a 100 hours of custom games and after playing through the campaigns , your probably gonna have to get some mods and maybe also the two DLCs , otherwise the game just starts getting a bit dull ; my only other complaints , really , would be the overly simple dimplomacy system , which I felt lacked some features to make it more useful and inmersive , and also , I personally wasn 't a big fan of the first campaign , dropped it before I got to the end , though from what little I have played from the other campaigns , I think they are much better . So in summary , if you like turn-based strategy games and fantasy , this game is well worth the time and invesment , and if you are willing to get some mods and the DLCs , then I think you 'll get a very enjoyable experience for hundreds of hours , easily .

13934,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ivanleterrible/recommended/307780,ivanleterrible,307780,Mortal Kombat X is the latest entry in the MK franchise and boy , what a good game ! I must confess that I stoped playing those games since MK 3 and only now decided to go back to them . Seems like Mortal Kombat 9 got criticized for its cartoonish character models , especially the female ones , so this time in MKX they tried a more realist approach , making characters look more like real people , with men looking not that buff and women looking not that busty . The result is that now the carnage has a real gory feeling , like if you are taking part in some kind of slasher movie , especially whe you perform one of the infamous fatalities and do crazy gory stuff with the opponent 's body , like ripping their heart , cutting their head off and other even more macabre stuff . Single Player There 's a bunch of single player modes , so even if you don 't play online you still gonna find the game fun anyways . The story mode in this game is kinda good , I mean , it makes sense and is entertaining enough without being too dumb . Thumbs up to Netherrealm for making a fighter with a decent story mode . The other single player modes are usually variations of the traditional " towers " found in usual Mortal Kombat games , and here you have a huge amout of those towers . The most fun are the so called " living towers " which provide you some kind of challege to increase the fight difficulty , like fighting while the screen is shaking or with lasers blasting both opponents and so on . Online The only is kinda dead now , so you will only find random people to fight on weekends and such . Usually , to find an online partner , you have to call up someone on you friend list . That 's how most of the online activity happens . PC port It seems like when game was released , the netcode was broken and Netherrealm simply stopped caring about the PC version at all . Now all these problems were solved and the game runs fine on PC with all the content included . Problems The problems with this game are only two , both gameplay releated : 1- Fireballs and long ranged attacks are too overpowered . You can pick up certain characters and keep basically running away while apamming fireballs and the opponent can do little about it . Unfortunately , this seems to be a recurrent problem in all Netherrealm recent fighters . See Injustice 1 and 2 , for exemple . 2- The controls for the special moves are really messed up . Some follow the traditional MK style , like down , up + button , while others follow a more Street Fighter style , with quarter circle + button . I thinks it 's time for MK to adopt only one style and get rid of this mess . Overall , it is a very good and solid fighter I rate it 4.8/5.0

13938,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MarkDarkness/recommended/464060,MarkDarkness,464060,I thought this would be an interesting game to pick up , particularly seeing as I sunk quite a few hours into Neon Chrome , but it simply didn 't click for me . Games in this genre live and die by their gameplay , and no amount of interesting visuals can compensate for that . Unfortunately , Ruiner 's controls just feel kind of disjointed and unresponsive , at least on a mouse and keyboard setup . Conceptually the narrative is decent , I guess it 's trying hard to be edgy , but the writing of the script just never really delivers on what the setting could provide , and feels weak on the overall . Can 't recommend .

The graphics are updated and seem to run well on my machine . The music is done well with a mixture of electronic and metal . If you enjoy smashing up cars , hitting pedestrians , and racing this is a solid game . The gameplay has a variety of races / battles in career mode . Kill your opponents to add their car to your stable . Finding tokens to upgrade your car can be a bit of a drag , but just be on the look out for them . If your going to pick this up I suggest getting a bundle of the series if you can , otherwise wait for a sale and grab it up . Just remember 200 points for grandma with a walker .

With wonderful and amazing stories . Here are my thoughts of that story : In the first episode , its kinda harsh to make these choises in cutscenes . Thinking what to say . I know this is a game but imagine this is real life . You live as a normal person who have friends and you want to have fun . When you meet those people who are mean , you somehow can make friends with them . Trust me , you are not that kind of person who wants to kill civilians in real life and in a game . You have some shoices to make . Leave them , kill them or just save them . I am a friendly person and I help people , so I started to save people and even those people who are in danger or almost dead . I do what I feel like . I make my own choises to make my story interesting . No fighting , just team work . All I can say is that this game is fun and I love it ! Story : 10/10 ! Characters :10/10! Other enemies / civlians in story : 10/10 ! All the episodes : 10/10 ! I really recommend to these people who likes Minecraft and wants a family friendly video ame with a tiny bit violence ! I hope you understand ... I love it !

Billed as an action murder mystery , Omensight takes elements from the movie Groundhog Day and infuses them with a Murder She Wrote style plot where you assume the role of the Harbinger , a warrior summoned to the world during times of strife and crises and tasked with solving the murder of a priestess which has sparked off an impending apocalypse . It is your duty to relive the worlds final day as you hunt for clues , fight enemies and uncover the culprit before all is lost . It 's a Greek tragedy told beautifully with high contrast cell shading that gives the game a unique look . The games combat , whilst not overly complicated , is just the right side of enjoyable as it slowly introduces new powers and abilities to you the further you progress and offers just the right amount of challenge . Famed game designer and RPG scribe extraordinaire , Chris Avellone (Planescape: Torment , Pillars of Eternity , Fallout New Vegas ), adds heft to the writing duo of Nadim Boukhira (Stories) and Genese Davis who tell a story worthy of your time investigating and who flesh out each of the four suspects so that they end up being fully-fledged three dimensional characters and not cardboard caricatures . I enjoyed Omensight immensely , especially getting to know the surprisingly complex characters that inhabit this mystery . Recommended . One word to sum up the experience Intriguing Performance / Bug related incidents None . Game also ran flawlessly at 1080p and 2160. Similar to games Stories : The Path of Destinies ; Torchlight 1/2 ; The Legend of Zelda : Majora 's Mask ; Bastion Suitable for Suitable for people who enjoy solving mysteries , who enjoy stories centered around time travel , those who enjoy action RPG 's that ere more on the cartoon side graphically .

There have been quite a few improvements to OOTP since my last purchase (OOTP10) and the obvious change is the MLB license . For those unfamiliar with the series , this is a TEXT based game with visuals to generally represent the action . Once you are hired by your team , you control almost everything (after your budget allocation from the owner ). As the GM , you can directly control (or delegate to the AI ) player and staff contracts , FA signing , roster promotions / demotions , trades and even ticket prices . Then as the manager , you set your pitching rotation and lineups and play ball . From there , it 's up to you if you want to play the game days or simulate through them and just be the GM . Finally , there is a ton of flexibility with historical years and statistics of the entire MLB history from 1871. Pick a season to start and alter history . Or you can create a completely fictional league to play . A large user community already exists with entire fictional leagues , uniforms and players that are ready to download and import if you are interested . Who would like this game : Folks who want to be the GM of their favorite team and enjoy baseball 's rich statistics . Who would NOT like this game : Folks who want high end graphics and real-time in-game action (stick to the very good console baseball games ).
13962,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Seqqeqeth/recommended/540840,Seqqeqeth,540840,It 's a fun turn-based puzzle-adventure , but later levels can be a bit complex Having not played Hitman GO , I started this game with low expectations , but now that I finished it am pleasantly surprised . A decent number of levels , each with various stages or screens featuring a puzzle or series of interlinked puzzles , all linked together in a quest for an artifact , and a showdown with a giant snake . There are even some bonus missions that help to give the game more value for money . The game has some surprising additions too that fans of the original series may recognise . Acrobatic climbing , swan dive , and even some atmospheric music taken from the earliest titles , and a plethora of costumes to unlock , ranging from Angel of Darkness , to Area 51 , to Antarctica - even some ridiculous ones , like Midas Lara , which I 'm sure fans will recognise ;) Sadly though , no Bacon Lara . Thankfully the Steam version boasts unlimited hints (handy, given the later levels quickly ramp up in complexity ), and special costumes (such as Hitman Lara ) are already included . My only issues were with Cave of Fire and Mirror of Spirits later half . The new versions of regular enemies have the ability to come back to life after a couple of moves , which I thought was a bit far-fetched , and that far too many of the later puzzles seemed to require a lot of trial and error , as there are just way too many moves between starting and ending a given puzzle that most of us just can 't think that far ahead . Mirror of Spirits , while perhaps not as difficult , was challenging in a different way as you had to guide TWO characters at the same time . MoS might have been set in the Croft Manor to begin with , but what it turned into quickly became a nightmarish psychadelic splintered dimension , with bits of doors , windows and bookshelves scattered around great big gaping holes of nothingness . Memorable , but for the all the wrong reasons . Loved the timed switches . Loved the boulders . Bit too heavy on the combat for my liking though . If there was going to be a LC GO 2 , I think there needs to be larger areas , more hidden things , more abilities , less enemies . Overall , a solid title worth adding to your Tomb Raider collection .

13966,https://steamcommunity.com/id/marksmanozzzy/recommended/448510,marksmanozzzy,448510,I purchased Overcooked : Gourmet Edition during a Steam sale . Overall , it is a fun local co-op game but it REALLY does need online multiplayer ; especially for those days when no one in the household wants to be player two . Completing a kitchen by yourself with three stars is doable but it 's both more enjoyable & less strenuous with more people (obviously). Definitely recommend playing with a controller vs . keyboard . Also , I would have liked to have seen additional recipe combinations & kitchen layouts . I would say it currently offers less than what it could offer . I still recommend this game but am not sure it 's worth the regular price without online multiplayer .

13971,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stripstroke/recommended/433850,stripstroke,433850,I saw the game leave early access so I thought I might as well give this a shot , even though I was disappointed with the direction this game has taken . I 've owned this game since day one , with the game getting rebranded 3 times and reworked on I lost all hope of ever getting back the H1Z1 I paid for and loved . This game is not good , not one bit seriously there 's nothing here that other battle royal games don 't do better . Why is this even called H1Z1 there 's no zombies nothing ... Daybreak didn 't just sweep this under the rug like other companies , they buried this game 6 feet under and ironically they still hope they can turn it around . If you guys just stuck with the original concept and design you sold to everyone none of this would have happened the damn game was a success and now it 's not even close to what it was . Daybreak is scum they ruin everything they touch , play what you want enjoy it I 'm not one to tell you what to do but think twice before supporting this company . We 've all been burned before and it 'll happen again ! I 'll never buy anything from them again and I haven 't since H1Z1 originally released .
13972,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xShadowsaur/recommended/582010,xShadowsaur,582010,The long and short of it is that this game is good . Simple . Having played Monster Hunter : Freedom Unite for the PSP and Monster Hunter Tri for the Wii I can wholeheartedly say this experience doesn 't disappoint . Since this is my only exposure to the Monster Hunter series this is the basis from which I 'll judge this game . The additions and changes made to the series work well together , the most prominent example are the changes to the levels . With no loading screens between rooms within a locale the devs were given the freedom to make crazy , massive maps that are admittedly difficult to navigate . To counter the difficulty the scoutflies mechanic works beautifully and , while the maps are large and multi-tiered , they also are memorable and reward memorization . The introduction and fleshing out of endemic life , additional things that creatures of all types (endemic life , small monsters , large monsters ) do in various situations , and things like turf wars make this game extremely organic and vivacious . The addition of personalized rooms with pets and whatnot allow for a personal albeit cosmetic touch onto things and allow for a nice room to just settle in and relax . The fact that this Monster Hunter bothered to have a story is pleasing and it allows for a nice progression system throughout the locales and with different foes . I initially didn 't think I 'd appreciate a story mode in a game that proports to be multiplayer and is also Monster Hunter , but I was pleasantly surprised . One final thing I 'd like to say is I am very glad that they kept in expeditions , and even expanded them , from Tri . That was honestly one of my favorite parts of Tri , just wandering the island . As per usual Monster Hunter World is extremely Monster Hunter . It is beautifully designed aesthetically with its odd and lively machinery , it has the same gratification from wearing your foes . It also has the same farming for resources both directly (going on missions ) and indirectly (using the farming mechanisms ). The combat is still quite Monster Hunter and came back to me almost immediately . Of course I stubbornly cling to my longswords . On a more negative note : I am a bit disappointed they discarded the swimming mechanics altogether . I thought they added for an interesting kiting dynamic , trying to lure enemies out of water , but I can understand why people would prefer it not being a factor . I wish there were more locales to explore but considering this is online I 'm sure more will be added , and the ones we have are massive and rich and pretty unique . All in all this game is great , I 'm so happy to see it on PC and I know I have many more hours with it in the future .

13987,https://steamcommunity.com/id/peppage/recommended/777880,peppage,777880,Video Review : <url> Fluffy Horde is pretty good . The levels are fairly challenging with a good mix of strategies . The objective is similar (and get can get weird !) but the way you complete it changes . A simple example is how the game might limit you from building certain units . The levels are really short and I really like how even though the game dishes out three medals at the end for completing a level in a certain way it doesn 't stop you from progressing . Thank you ! Anyway , I think some levels are padding and were too easy but a majority of them are well done . The look and feel of the game is good , especially the UI . Killing bunnies is so silly and I found myself getting caught up playing more than I expected .
13988,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cringkamp/recommended/298560,cringkamp,298560,I was really excited when I picked this game up . All the LPs I watched and just the buzz around it was phenominal . When I actually purchased the game , I didn 't regret it at all . After playing it for a few hours , however , I 've noticed that the game has a very weird spike in difficulty around the 3rd and 4th world . Every time I reach these stages I 'm always out classed in terms of hardware . Either that , or , when I finnaly find an enemy I can kill to upgrade my ship to match the objective , one or two ships 1-2 levels higher than me suddenly appear and wreck my {?} I acknowledge that most of this is probably poor play , and I greatly enjoy the difficulty , but it has begun to become monotonous farming forever trying to match the ship level I need to proceed . Still love the game , and I really look forward to playing it some more .
13989,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/301860,stumpo,301860,Imagine a game that takes the wordless storytelling , melancholy mood , and mechanic of leaving home base to find a target around the world from Shadow of the Colossus . It adds the automatic platforming / climbing mechanics and bar-filling collectathon of Assassin 's Creed , the overgrown vegetation cityscape of Enslaved , and the sailing of Wind Waker . ... but then removes all difficulty , danger , combat , and dialogue . The core game works like this : You are a young woman . The game opens with you pulling up your small motorboat to a temple in a city almost entirely submerged in water--only the tops of tall buildings like hotels and hospitals stick out from the water . You bring your brother , sick and injured on the brink of death into the temple and lay him on an altar . You set out to explore the ruins of the buildings looking for supply drops to heal him . The game proceeds with you taking your boat around the water , looking for landmarks--the most memorable for me was a ruined ferris wheel--animals (mutated sealife , mostly ), and collectible books that tell you the story of what happened to the city through little pictograph images that are sort of like cute hieroglyphs . The main game involves climbing large towers to get supply drop cases at the top . I should say that climbing the towers is pretty straightforward . The game does not have puzzles , and you do not have limited grip strength . Like an Assassin 's Creed tower , it 's mostly just about hopping to the next handhold or finding the next ledge . You 're a tourist here . If that sounds like something you wouldn 't want to play , then I wouldn 't buy the game , but I liked it . Different towers are different--one is a giant skyscraper where you weave from exterior ledges across vegetated floors , while another has you taking the path to a top of hollow , donut-shaped hospital , and then climbing down and around the inside to get to the rest of the roof . Another has a zip-line at the top of a roof . Are the locations memorable ? The negative reviews say no . I found them memorable enough to keep going and tell apart in my head . The towers also have storybook collectibles off hidden paths . Like Team Ico 's games , the characterization is mostly inferred through very indirect images . There is no voiced dialogue and no explicit explanation or development (again, the family 's story is told through unlocking pictographs ). But you get the sense of a girl who is protecting her younger brother and doesn 't want to give up on him no matter the cost . The game lasts around 3 hours with a little more for getting all of the collectibles . At 5 hours , I got my final achievement . Visually the game is somewhat simple , but striking in its beauty . The day-night cycle leads to great moments where the sun or moon or weather patterns interact with the scenery . The game provides a photo mode feature that lets you turn off the UI and pick a camera angle . You can take some really wonderful photos . Whether or not I 'd recommend the game depends entirely on your taste . It 's possible you 'll buy it and think , " wait , this is it , I 'm just doing the same thing again and again , nothing is going on , there 's no challenge " . If that 's what you think , bummer dude , sorry you didn 't like it . But I liked it and if my description sells it to you , then I hope you like it too .

13991,https://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/373990,EdenStarGazer,373990,I only have a half hour in this game because it felt like a gimmicky platformer . After that , I uninstalled and moved it to the hidden section of my game library . It seems to be a decent platformer , but it is sold under the guise of something new and groundbreaking . It could have been . I 'd actually like to see someone develop a game where metrics clock your progress through a game world . That would be cool . But , Metrico + is not that . Metrico + is admittedly an abstract art game , with the visuals performing like background art . I 've played Proteus and Journey on the PS3 , and I could almost see Metrico + falling in the same genre . The big difference is Proteus , though having simple graphics , at least left you with a sense of having interacted with your surroundings . And , Journey had a submersive feeling to it ¡­ the spellbinding journey through the desert was surreal at moments . I felt nothing like that at all in my half hour in Metrico +. At ¡®checkpoints' (I presume they were checkpoints , because I quit very fast ) the avatar opened randomly appearing doors to proceed , in a sort of cut scene that just felt like a loss of control over the progression of the game . One such door came very soon after the first door . So , really it didn 't feel like a reasonable place to have a new checkpoint . Then , my avatar would float up in the air for no explainable reason , while I waited for ¡­. something ¡­ anything ¡­. to tell me I 'd achieved some portion of the game . But , that was it . Nothing happened after these floating experiences but more abstract & easy platforming . Cons : 1. The background visuals did not change the gameplay in any important way . 2. The moving bars in the foreground were easily solvable platformer elements . 3. The resulting platformer was too easy to decipher . 4. The background visuals functioned like unartistic art . I see no good reason to buy or play Metrico +. I got it with the Humble Bundle monthly , so I 'm out nothing but a half hour , and the excited hopeful anticipation I 'd felt before playing this ¡®new' game . Yeah , it was a disappointment . But , there 's Witness I 've installed and that should prove to be a visually new and different game . But , Metrico + is not that .

13996,https://steamcommunity.com/id/neutronenstern/recommended/402160,neutronenstern,402160,This game , no matter how promising it may look , is simply a disgrace . There is literally not a single aspect of the game that isn 't bugged . It 's not even close to playable at this point , no matter how hard you try . As if this wouldn 't be already a deal breaker , the really sad thing is that the devs are simply incompetent to manage the mess they 've build . Development is slow , unfocused and unprofessional . IMHO this game has not the slightest chance to be finished and without any doubt will end as abandon ware . Trust me , I know what an abandonware candidate looks like since I learned it the hard way by supporting Kinetic Void , Spacebase DF and way to many other EA titles ... and those games where even in a better state than this game . It 's such a shame since it would be exactly the kind of game I would love to play .
13997,https://steamcommunity.com/id/froakiethroat/recommended/350080,froakiethroat,350080,Standalone expansion to my personal Game of the Year for 2014. Split into two episodes , The Old Blood catalogs the events that took place in 1946 prior to the events of Wolfenstein : The New Order . Both episodes call back to previous Wolfenstein titles , with episode 1 being a one-man assault on Castle Wolfenstein , and episode 2 dipping back into the more occult side of the Wolfenstein series (Nazi Zombies ) . It pains me to say that it ultimately feels like a bit of a step back from Wolfenstein : The New Order - sporting a less remarkable cast of heroes and villains , as well as a lack of interesting locales . Pacing at the start of the game also feels very off , putting a pretty big emphasis on stealth (far from the game 's strong suit ). If you can look past these points however , the game still offers tons of enjoyment in terms of Nazi-dismemberment and crazy suicidal dual-wielding gun-play . The value proposition is also sound . My full playthrough lasted just under 6 hours (attaining about 50% of the collectables ). Not bad for a ?15/$20 game . If you enjoyed The New Order , I can recommend it solely on the appeal of it 's gameplay - but if you 're new to Machine Game 's vision of Wolfenstein , go with The New Order over The Old Blood .
13998,https://steamcommunity.com/id/indigoviking/recommended/305620,indigoviking,305620,UPDATE : 24 hours in and I 've uninstalled the game . It 's complete garbage . Good game , could be better . Heavily flawed . My first experience was pretty neat , I found a gun pretty quickly with a box of ammo and I killed every wolf that I came across . I almost froze to death many times , but then one day a wolf comes at me around a house and I didn 't see it , it didn 't see me but somehow it knew I was there and it attacked me . I stabbed that wolf FOUR TIMES with my knife and it runs off . I cleaned my wound , started collecting wood because you need a fire every hour in this game to not freeze to death but , it takes you 15 minutes to break a stick into 3 , because logic . After I broke my stick , the same wolf comes BACK and blind sides me AGAIN and I stabbed that F ***er FOUR MORE TIMES and guess what , it ran off . I patched up , started gathering wood , THE WOLF COMES BACK AGAIN AND I STABBED IT FOUR MORE TIMES FFS and it ran off , a third time . At this point , my health is very low , I had 2 bullets left , I patched up again , still freezing to death , the wolf comes back less than a minute after the last attack and I pulled out my rifle because I was just done with this s ***. Except what you don 't know is that you 're a guy with parkinsons and you can 't hold a gun still at all , so the iron sights , not the barrel are spinning in circles (because more logik ? mak sense much wow ?) and I pulled the trigger but the delay or something happened and it didn 't fire at all , I think the animation triggered where the wolf attacks you and it cancelled out me firing the gun , so that was great . I stabbed that F ***ING wofl FOUR MORE TIMES , but this time he kills me . Apparently stabbing a wolf with a hunting knife 16 times isn 't enough to kill it , in the damn neck . These wolves are invicible and have god mode on unless you shoot them . This is so stupid . When I first started playing the game it seemed a lot bigger than it actually is . The more you play it , the smaller it gets and you realize you will quickly be doing the same thing over and over again . I am enjoying the game so far and I will be playing it for a while but it 's getting to the point where it 's feeling repetitive . Here are my issues with the game as it stands . The fact it takes you 28 minutes in game time to " break down " a small cardboard box , is silly to me . This game goes for realism , but who takes that long to tear down a cardboard box . A small WOODEN crate , takes less time to break down by hand for firewood than a cardboard box . It takes you 10 minutes to tear up a t-shirt , and I would go on and on but you get the point . When you get to playing the game and you spend SO much time doing senseless things it 's just irritating . They need to change this , and balance the time it takes to do these tasks . You don 't have that much daylight , so when you take an hour of your 8 hour daylight time to break down TWO cardboard boxes (friggen please )....what the hell devs . Another thing , is that you can 't defend yourself from animals unless you have a gun . You can 't equip your hatchet , a crowbar or anything , but you can equip a rock ? So , when a wolf runs at you all you can do is stand there and wait for it to start biting your d *** off , then you can use your axe or knife etc . You can build a snow shelter , which should be named a snow grave because it 's completely useless since you still drop in body temp , and sleeping in it isn 't possible unless you want to freeze to death . Not even sure why this exists , to be honest . All in all , the game has potential , but this would be better off it did have zombies in it , and if simple tasks didn 't take you half a day . Or , if they gave you options to build things , like a drying rack instead of just dropping hide and guts on the floor to dry it (lul). I would like to be able to make a cabin my own , hunt the area etc . But this game is more about trying to survive in subzero temps by walking around everywhere , because that 's how one would survive in these conditions (not). So glad they have a warning when you open the game that this isn 't an example or training for survival because otherwise I would be thinking that wolves are invicible and that the best way to survive is to constantly travel .

I realized too late that the product video on Steam for liteCamHD is a bit misleading , this is *not* a rebundled version of the liteCam HD software as I had hoped , it is a commercial version of their previously-free liteCam Game software (now with more FPS and no watermark ). I have been disappointed with several things : it does not have the Audio Recording option seen in the video , the insertion of Title and Credits shown in the video is not the ability to splice in your own clips for either - it is text on a black background set by you which is displayed for a moment or scrolled past as credits - far less robust than I had hoped , the Video Recording menu shows options for FPS above 30 but you cannot select them - I hope they will be in a future update , there was one error message I received so far when the PIP failed but it was entirely in Korean so I have no way to know what the actual problem was , and most of all the video trimming function has not worked well for me - perhaps I 'm using it wrong , but any video I have tried to trim has come out black with audio intact . I have reported my issues to the company but no official response has been given yet (well over a week ago ). I had wanted to use this for non-Game video or audio capturing , but it 's not the software I had hoped for . No refunds allowed here , so I 'm just glad I got it on sale . That said , I bet it works great for game capturing , if all you want to do is record the video and work on that video outside of this software . I 'd recommend trying their trial version on their website first though .

14009,https://steamcommunity.com/id/himynameissean/recommended/268910,himynameissean,268910,This is the most frustratingly fun game I think I 've ever played .
14010,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sengtsan/recommended/3830,sengtsan,3830,Probably the best storytelling , humour and creativity I 've ever seen in a video game . The writing in Psychonauts is absolutely brilliant . Head and shoulders above anything else I 've experienced in gaming . It boasts a gloriously funny , perceptive and , in some ways , deep story and script . Much of it is centred around overcoming personal demons in a psychologically sophisticated way that is never pretentious or preachy . The overraching premise is about as good as it gets : you must solve crimes and resolve issues by entering minds . The technical execution is brilliant , the voice acting , music and art design is first class ; the comic timing , both visual and scriptwise , is a joy ; and the highly imaginative and truly 3D worlds are amongst the most creative things I 've seen in the medium . In short it 's brilliant . The flaws ? Alas , they are numerous , and , at times , major . Psychonauts betrays Double Fine 's point and click roots with the really frustrating puzzles throughout , which are too cryptic for their own good . There are also some horrendously difficult platforming parts , made worse by horrible camera behaviour . In certain parts I was not enjoying playing at all . I also don 't like having to resort to game guides , but when I did , I found there was no way I would have managed without advice . Now , if you don 't mind point and click adventures and your brain is wired to " trying every combination because there is no logic behind the puzzle " sort of gaming , that might not be an issue . Point and click is my least favourite genre , so these objections might be too harsh . Enough criticism ; because when the game is fun , it truly is amazing . The characters are brilliantly realised , the story is a joy , and the humour is clever , sly and perceptive . In spite of the many problems I have with the gaming aspects , for me it 's still one of the best examples of video games out there . Bring on Psychonauts 2 !

The campaigns are nice , if totally blind and very gimmicky . They give enough cards from the set to make a deck with , but it 's at the barest level of functionality . To " earn " packs , you either need to play PvP to grind that 400 gold-per-day cap , or non-campaign matches against the AI . The three levels of " difficulty " are actually a lie : easy is the hardest , and hard is the easiest ; the AI has been proven to always start with a favorable hand , because they want you to play PvP , and never look into their poor programming . It will hold on to a single card the entire match (40+ rounds ) and play it as the , " I won when the game started " card . Easy AI plays strong early game , which often has a good late game , and hard has lots of good stuff , interspersed in the bottom half of the deck . Does shuffling move them ? Who knows ? Quests are the worst feature , by far . You can and will cycle and cycle , only to get three PvP quests . If you don 't like PvP , because it 's stressful , meta 'd to hell , slow , and never mind the fact that whoever the hell is in charge REFUSES to ban hackers or exploiters , this is objectively not the game for you . There is no " Clear my quest log " button . You have to log in each day to see if there 's one you can do in AI matches . Some of them are ridiculous even there , such as the , " Win two matches in which you generate at least 15 energy ." Not only do you have to win , you have to achieve a certain amount of energy , which you should be writing down as you go . This means the match can take twenty minutes to an hour , depending on how controlling either you or the bot is . Overall , if you like PvP , you might be okay . But if you play against AI for the fun of the actual " Magic : The Gathering " game , this game is strictly worse than Magic 2015 , in which they had a clear separation between AI (not really " PvE " ) and PvP advancement .

14022,https://steamcommunity.com/id/OfficialTink/recommended/287700,OfficialTink,287700,I forgot to write a review for this game , but with over 300 hours in it , with only play Metal Gear Online for a few hours , I can say that this is one of the must-have games on Steam , or any console for that matter . If you enjoy : Sandbox , open world , stealth , run and gun , or shooters in general , this game may be for you . There is an almost infinite number of ways to tackle your missions , and it 's up to you on how you do it . Plus , once you 're done with the main story , you have Forward Operating Bases to take care of , where other players can invade your FOBs , and you can attack theirs . All in all , this is one of the best games that anyone can have on Steam .
