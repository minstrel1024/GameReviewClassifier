Separated into 5 episodes , each one offers you a chance to make personal choices which in the end , impact on the outcome of the rest of the game . Worthy of it 's 2012 Game of the Year wins , THE WALKING DEAD is a must-play game for all .
2,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hiperdrive/recommended/599960,hiperdrive,599960,This game was good ... although it seems " half bad done " , it has certain charm , and I like it someway . It has enough things inside the game itself , which does not end up making him so boring (like a lot of mini-games and ways to go ). The dialogues , the places and the randomization in general , it is quite cool in some way , the duration of the game is good , for the type of game , since there are so many games in the steam that are crap and they are still short . >>>On the other hand ... The generic sounds are annoying and the music is pretty standard , presents poor controls and game itself is poorly polished (perhaps because of the limitation of the engine used ). A tip for the developer : when recording a sound , try not to record the sound with the fan on , or simply edit your sound in some way so as not to have the irritant wind noise . Thanks ,

7,1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052234251/recommended/48700,76561198052234251,48700,Hello fellow gamer , So I been playing this game for a while now and would like to give a feed back and say what I think about this game . First of all in general this is a very good game with hours of fun . If you can get it while there is a discount definitly buy it . But now lets come to the bugs and stupid things about the game , to be honoest this is the reason I am writing this review . - some quests are annoying as hell , like trying to find the bandit camps quests , or worst quests ever is trying to rescue a prisoner . In order to rescue a prisoner you can do three thing ; 1st go takeover the castle , 2nd find someone with connections to the castle your prisoner is being held . (have never seen anyone doing it this way ) and the 3rd way is going to the village associated with the castle and asking the village leader to set fire which you pay him 200golds then you can sneak in to the castle , this way you shouldb e only fighting the prison guard but nope I keep fighting the hall castle still . - when you are asked to collect a tax from a village or deliver a message to someone they are almost always on the other side off the world (map) - when you start the game it is a bit too hard even with easy setting . hard to level your troops , raise gold , buy armor &weapon and later on when you have a strong troop , which you get around day 100-150 generaly , then the game gets way to easy . (with my 100 troops I win againts a hall kingdom (100 vs 700-900 troops ) without even loosing a single soldier . At one point I had like 10-12 counts ,lords and their king as my prisoner , no one left to pay their ransom in their kingdom :) - Game constantly crashes like every couple of hours . So I am quick saving like every 5-10 minutes :( I am playing on a mac but the got the game directly from steam and it is a mac version so not sure how it plays on a pc . Anyhow in general I would give this game 4 out of 5.

I am just going to put that out there to start , who knows maybe they threw in some big crazy puzzle near the end but I doubt it . I was roughly at the part where you return from visiting the aliens and get the infinite placement power . This game was good I will admit . It looks amazing and the puzzles are not bad , but that 's all . I played the first Q . U . B . E . a long , long time ago and this game is just more of the first with a poorly writen story added in between chambers . I can 't say the 25 (20 when I bought it )$ price tag is worth roughly 4 hours of gameplay . I really don 't want to say to not get the game but the truth is between the first game and this game the gameplay doesn 't stack up to the countless cheaper and better puzzle games that came out since then . Get the first Q .U.B.E., hell just get Portal to be honest , but this game while I was really please to see it came out when I woke up today (I had no clue of its release date prior to today ) it just didn 't live up to my hopes . If this game releases dev tools and creates a workshop it will be worth every single dollar but until then this game is just not worth it .

Of course this is a choice based visual novel and not going to appeal to everyone , plus it 's a shame that there 's no voice acting as it could have added something to the experience .

Are you going to forget about morals and just do whatever is necessary to ensure your group 's safety , or are you going to go out of your way to help people in need ?

And that is not an easy task . Losing someone really feels terrible .

34,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrCharmy/recommended/680360,MrCharmy,680360,Editing my review to say that the Devs keep updating the game every week and it 's getting better and better . If it was worth grabbing before , now it 's definetly a must ! Has a lot of potential , I easily spent 2 and a half hours on it the first time playing and I still wanna go back to it and explore more of the map . The mechanics of the game are addicting and rewarding , often presenting to you hard enemies you can barely defeat and letting you go back later in the game and recking face (I'm looking at you troll ). It 's well worth the price , and depending on how ofter they 'll update , it could become one hell of an indie game . Some suggestions though : Have a quick and easy way to manage your workers . A list with the locations and how many workers are there would help A TON since I wouldn 't have to keep clicking on the map nodes to see if the resources are depleted and how many workers are there . (EDIT: There 's actually this function implemented in the game . Click the hammer icon on the bottom left corner of the map and a nice list of your workers , resource nodes and resources per minute will show up ).

I 've been even thinking about how much money did I just waste ! But after sometime I got used to it and I can say I like it ! xd +Controller works with every single game on steam . Some games are supported for controller and some aren 't.(Some NonSupported games are actually unplayable but if you are some kind of nerd into these things you can make your own settings and you can make every game playable with controller . +Controller also works on desktop without Big Picture mode or without having game turned on so you can go on youtube or browse internet with controller .(No idea how is that usefull but it 's kinda cool .) %Keyboard and Mouse are indeed always better . Steam controller is usefull thing for some people and also kinda cool thing , but if you wanna use steam controller on 100% then you should also buy steam link or steam console and connect it to your Television . Then you can chill with your controller in bed and play games with it on television . Some games playable with Steam Controller Don ?t starve Together / Don ?t starve Rocket league Terraria There are more controller playable games but I don 't remember playing any others !

56,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Icember/recommended/397060,Icember,397060,Faeria is a refreshing take on an old formula . Although at first glance it may look like a Hearthstone / MTG knockoff , it 's so much more ! Where other CCGs will have you play minions to smash into your opponent 's minions or face , the addition of a hex-grid opens up a vast amount of strategic possibilities . As mentioned things work a little differently in Faeria . The first thing to note is that mana (which is called faeria ) is cumulative . You gain 3 every turn and there and there are 4 sidewells to harvest 1 faeria each turn from with your minions , so if you save up the first couple turns you can play some big stuff pretty quickly ! This can be risky too , though , as if you haven 't played any creatures you won 't be able to harvest from the faeria wells to get ahead of your opponent 's faeria curve . Cards in Faeria must meet two requirements : 1 ) The faeria cost & 2 ) The land thresholds . There are 4 types of elemental lands : Forests , Mountains , Lake , & Desert that you can make one of each turn , and a 5th type of neutral land , plains , which you can create 2 of per turn . Switching between these two is key to developing the board aggressively & getting your creatures into your opponent 's hero orb . The colored cards will need to be played on your corresponding colored land types , but your neutral cards can go on any field you control , so keep that in mind too when developing a deck . Neutral cards are also very handy because they don 't require you to have elemental lands . Developing a board effectively is both challenging and rewarding . Figuring out your opponent 's deck / playstyle is key to winning card games , but in Faeria you can use more than just their faeria (mana) & cards they 've played . Have they played a couple of mountains ? You better expect some damage dealing red control cards . Have they played two neutral lands and a desert directly towards you , sacrificing the ability to farm faeria from the side wells ? Chances are they 're a yellow rush deck & you better decide if you need to play defensively or face race . There are many decisions to make in this game on every turn , which is why I ultimately feel like this game surpasses Hearthstone in terms of how much control player skill has over the outcome of matches . But don 't worry , there 's still a little a RNG thrown in w / some cards if that 's your thing . The developers are constantly looking @ the way games are played & fine-tuning / balancing is done very conservatively & with careful consideration . I paid a few dollars for early access & feel it was worth every penny , but if you 're conscious of $ it IS free to play & some of the best players in the community pride themselves on being F2P . With monthly tournaments (doling out prize money , mind you ), a rich art style , a vibrant meta (new strategies are always being discovered / developed ), multiple ways to play including single player , constructed Casual / Ranked , & Pandora (similar to Arena from Hearthstone but with OP treasure cards each player drafts into their deck ), and a very friendly community , you 'd be a fool to not try it . Just make sure you sacrifice a yak to appease Garudan first . That guy can ruin your day otherwise !

The Cloud is not a big problem , the beeping only requires a small amount of trial and error , and only in some areas ; otherwise both hazards are very manageable and have a risk / reward factor . For the skeptical ; i played this at level 29 , and levelled up to level 30 after finding Dog / God , which put all the enemies 5 levels higher than me for the rest of the DLC . I was fine . I played hardcore , i had a decent skill set , i died a few times , and only to being overwhelmed by enemies . This is a very memorable DLC that works in cohesion with the rest , and should be respected as much as Old World Blues or Honest hearts .

66,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/evil_taco/recommended/242640,evil_taco,242640,Way too many scripted deaths by unbeatable enemies . Reutilizing the same puzzles a second time is a lazy game extending option as well . The storyline was great . I enjoyed the drawings over the actual computer animation . The game was more frustrating than enjoyable but I wanted to see it through to the end . I don 't foresee myself purchasing any future installments unless it is a completely different engine . These are just my opinions , if you want to play the game then by all means . I would suggest waiting for a sale though as I did .

72,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Biohazard2191/recommended/294100,Biohazard2191,294100,Have had this game for some time now . Haven 't put as many hours into it as I 'd like . I 'm currently up at about 2 :30 in the morning after just losing the last of my colony . Started with three folks I named Axl , Brick and Frankie Frankie was an awesome hunter but I noticed she moved a bit slow . That 's when I realized she was pushing 85 years old . Axl harvested a {?} ton of berries while Brick made clothes and butchered any food killed . At some point in late fall the temperature dropped quick and low and no one had warm enough clothes so it became a race against time to gather anything outside the house . At some point Mike joined after being chased by pirate and had nothing but pants . Then Matthew arrived and everyone began suffering hypothermia and infected limbs . In one fight someone had an eye blown out . The cat even lost its front paw .. After everyone simoultaneously getting too sick to work , the pet raccoon was eaten by a fox , Brick went down trying to save it but realized he was too slow in the snow , then was hunted down himself . Frankie hobbled out to save Brick and went down because of old age . Axl saved everyone and was left to then save Matthew and Henry who were attacked by a wolf . After realizing he was all that was left he lay in bed locked in the house with the cat waiting for the lone raider who decided to pick the best time to drop in . Raider blows up solar panels and as Axl runs out to put out the fire , he is clubbed and kiddnapped . While waiting to be taken away there is one last cry . Arctic wolf ate the cat ... Sounds like the story of my life ..

74,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fjerwG/recommended/578080,fjerwG,578080,I wanted to recommend this game before but now its full of hackers / cheaters , every new " patches " is making the game worse for me , the game is still not optimized (a 1060 6gb , i5-7600k and 16 gb ram ddr4 can 't run this properly ), many known glitches and bugs are still in the game since the launch that aren 't even fixed yet and the netcode is worse than Ubisoft 's. I know it 's early access but really , 7 months and many KNOWN bugs are still there . But if you don 't care about cheaters , that you may (or not if you have luck ) have 40 fps or less and that there 's many bugs (I know that a game without bugs & glitches doesn 't exist but with that many ...) I 'd recommend this game . Edit : you 'll be able to run this game fine but in big cities , expect big fps drops Edit2 : Now when you win , you don 't even get the battle points Edit3 : Now you get your points but apparently some plants are walls now (exemple : the one in the casino at Pecado , in the map Miramar )

Not only does it successfully mimic what made countless NES era games such as Ninja Gaiden and Castlevania so wildly successful back in the day , it actually succeeds in passing majority of the games it pays homage too . The metroidvania / 8 & 16 Bit revival has produced a glut of modern retakes on these old , familiar tropes but none of them have successfully achieved what The Messenger achieves , which is a perfect symbiosis of old and new . The closest modern retake I can think that matches The Messenger beat for beat is Yacht Clubs magnificent Shovel Knight so just know that you are incredible company here . The Messenger is an incredibly well designed game from its cast of colourful , well written , characters that help flesh out its gorgeously and cleverly designed world . Each area is painstakingly recreated in both 8 and 16 bit which houses many secrets as the player learns to shift between the two asethics . I must also give the game credit for its writing and story . I don 't normally go into metroidvania 's or platformers thinking I am going to get an enjoyable tale , merely just a serviceable one as narrative is usually nothing more than a means to and end in these kinds of games , but The Messenger raises that bar in such a way that I often had to check myself that I wasn 't playing a big sprawling narrative heavy RPG / action adventure game . While the game has many dramatic arcs thankfully it never takes itself too seriously and I often found myself chuckling along at it as its crazy , and fantastic , story unfolded . Where The Messenger succeeds the most , and the one area that could have easily sunk it , is with the gameplay which plays out like blazingly fast ballet of swords , shuriken and leaps that when choreographed in perfect harmony almost reaches a nirvana-like state of euphoria in the player . Please don 't look at the The Messenger and pass it off as just " another retro-indie " because you will be doing yourself a great disservice and missing out on one of the best gaming experiences of the year , or any year for that fact . One word to sum up the experience Classic Performance / Bug related incidents No issues Similar to games Shovel Knight ; Castlvania Symphony of the Night ; Ninja Gaiden ; Axiom Verge Suitable for People who enjoy retro inspired games , people who enjoy strong narratives , people who just enjoy good games in general . Current position in my games of 2018 cleared list 3rd position . Rating <url>

Plenty of story even before all the DLC and no subscription fee to play after initial purchase which is a huge plus . There is a subscription , but it is in no way a requirement and you don 't need it to play the full game , but it does give you 1500 crowns which is $15 worth of in game currency and you get access to all the DLC you don 't already own .

Vermintide had the best and most intense co-op I ever played , I couldn 't get enough and the feeling of progression is amazing . every game you play you feel like your getting better , your learning the machanics and tweaking your play style more and more and then once you get good gear and you found experienced players and got your four man team all ready to go ..THEN the real fun begins because you move up to cata and that blew me away with how intense it felt , I just couldnt get enough ....but that was the first one and if any of this sounds good to you and you want to play somthing challengeing and intense , with the best melee combat I have ever experienced then this is a MUST !! HAVE !! because Vermintide 2 is even better ......sooooooo summery if your not a whiny child this game is absolutely worth your money .

84,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/silent007warrior/recommended/292030,silent007warrior,292030,This is more than just a game . I played over 60 hours , still in main story . When this game released , it gets overwhelmingly positive reviews . I thought why this game getting positive rating and reviews because this game contains violence and 18 + contents . Then I purchased Game of the Year Edition on 10th Anniversary of Witcher game series . When I start playing , it 's graphics , soundtrack , story , environment , combat {?} , voice acting , and also Yen and Triss {?} . I loving it . ?For best experience : Ride and travel across the map using horse instead of Fast travel signs . Except travel to different regions (Velen, Kaer Mohan , etc .). Now a days , many game devs just care about money . And then they releases loot boxes and microtransactions to make more money . I hate that . Only CD Projekt Red care about every gamers . They gave insanely amounts of contents , quests , side-quests , secrets , various activites , gwent games , lots of stuffs to do and AAA title quality . This game also contains two huge expansions (Hearts of Stone , Blood and Wine ) and all DLCs if you buy Game of the Year Edition in just 19.99USD when on sale . I bought GOTY Edition for Rs .399(INR) or just says $6.17USD. They deserve what they want . Please support them ?. And that 's it , I have nothing much to say . I highly recommend it . One of the best RPG game . My final verdict is 10/10. Sorry if my English is not very good .

It worked for some people , but not for me . I won 't go into details why . The thing I liked the most is the writing . You know how almost every japanese vn have awful writing with cliched and super-unrealistic characters that come out of paper of someone who doesn 't know human feelings at all . When I found out that DDLC was NOT written in Japan , I was excited as there are better chances to get a good writing . And DDLC indeed has very good writing . All characters while took right from japanese vn character database get enough development and interesting perspective on some things that make them different from your average anime character . The only thing that bothered me is how main protagonist was ignorant to some obvious love signals from the girls . In the beginning he was certainly established as someone who had interested in these girls from the club . Maybe it 's just me but the level of ignorance reached that of harem mc oblivious heights . Other than that the characters are great and the romantic scenes are the thing that will stuck in my mind for a long time .

Many planets to expand bases , nukes , laser shooting moonbases , planet collisions . Almost a 100 units to build . Dayum . Only downside I can think of is a lack of campaign like story which almost every RTS games has . But dont let that alone stop you from playing this awesome game . Totally worth it .
89,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SHD_9115/recommended/433530,SHD_9115,433530,Pretty neat game but it 's one of those games that have good potential , though it 's playerbase is a let down . Very few battles on any server , I had to play on a US server once to play a battle with 4 players in (keep in mind I 'm from the EU ) Another downside is that a few veteran players that will smack talk you because you didn 't pick an AH attack helicopter or if you 've just installed but will easily rage quit if you either shoot them down or make them crash . Their isn 't a ranking system which I think is good as veteran players don 't know whether they 're smashing new players or getting smashed by the devs or elite players . Which also reminds me to speak of the devs as well . Played a game with them for about 20 min or so . They were a good opponent and a good laugh to play with and they support their commuinity . The game does need more players though I cannot stress that enough . TL :DR Great game , great devs , little playerbase .

You 're a Shiba Inu just happilly trotting along , trying to get coins , while snatching panties . It 's a silly concept , but is actually implemented well . The only controls are to click to jump , and you have to dodge various obstacles . I got all the achievements , which largely involves just grinding the game long enough to get the coins to unlock every costume . The one to get 802 panties was annoying to do , because I just kept playing without actually caring about how far I got each attempt . Overall : 7/10 , it 's nice and very cute , but gets pretty repetitive , and by the time I was grinding out the last achievements , I was pretty tired of it . That being said , for the price , this had more going on than I actually expected , so it 's definitely worth it .

You try to get the most points as fast as possible while growing your deck to become stronger . The art-work of the first game is a bit ugly , but the expansions look a lot better . 9 Expansions are included in the steam version . Info achievements : I like the kind of achievements this game has . A few are straight forward but most you need to do something specific , which I enjoy a lot . The online achievement to win 10 times in a row sucks , but will be able to unlock when you partner up with somebody else . For some achievements there is a guide on steam , but it is not complete anymore since the game had some updates . I hope somebody will complete the guide , if that happens I 'm pretty sure I 'll go for all the achievements . Pros & Cons : + very fun and addictive game + easy to learn the base + a lot of variation with the 9 expansions included in this steam version . + fun achievements - not yet a complete guide how to unlock all the achievements

104,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/icegriffin93/recommended/742460,icegriffin93,742460,The trailer makes the game appear more fun to play than it really is . I grew up on Super Monkey Ball and this game seemed to be a perfect fit for me , but it has been nothing but frustration with the physics and controls , as well as level design . For example , there 's a level where you boost up a half loop (shaped like the letter C ) that sends you immediately into a cluster of bumpers , but if you miss those there 's a sudden edge that 'll send you to your doom . And on the level that I quit on , there 's this propeller-type rotating board you need to jump onto , except its edges don 't meet with the platform you 're currently on , so you have to leap far onto it , but as it 's spinning fast , it tends to just fling you off . In a SMB level , the edges would have met , and the propeller would have briefly slown to a pause to allow you a chance to climb on board . There was also another level that supplied you with high jump power ups to leap over tall walls , some of them have a ceiling above you , causing you to get spiked down as soon as you jump (and you also seem to lose complete mid-air control when hit by an object ). You get sent down , and the powerup doesn 't respawn , so you have to fall off and die or hit R to start again . One level I did like , where you rolled forward at high speed across a bumpy course , sending you upward and bouncing around until you hit the end . This was a fun level , but if 90% of the game isn 't fun , then I think I 'll pass . I was really hoping to like this game , as Super Monkey Ball 2 is one of my favorite games ever , but the poor level design and physics are frustrating and haven 't been fun for me .

Some people complain about the replayability but I disagree ... just take a ook at my hours played haha .

They can 't control the bad hackers that screw with online , but they are busy taking down the good guys who just like having fun with their game and aren 't hurting anyone else . I usually try to steer clear of the hate train , but I have to jump on this one . R * insinuated mods would be ok as long as it didn 't mess with online . They clearly mislead the people who bought this game , they attempt legal measures against people who are probably the biggest fans of this game , and this whole mess has really turned me off from even playing it anymore . So much for any Sharkcard purchases from me , my wife , or any of my friends who all feel the same way . Way to go . TL / DR : I don 't want to live in a world I can 't play GTA as Iron Man .

Good to play with 5 Friends , a 4 vs 1 match :) The idea of this game is phenomenal . Look for it if you want but can not find it , no such game compares to this . I speak of the genre regarding Monsters like Doom , jumps like Unreal and Weapons like Quake . I loved the presentation of the game , the tutorials , the characters , the game modes . Nothing bad to indicate so far . Better you try by yourself :) <url>

The UI , top-down view , and the simple mouse control scheme make this game easy for anybody to pick-up and play , especially those who are accustomed to playing similar style pool games . The game focuses on online multiplayer matches , but the community is relatively small and you may have trouble finding opponents during certain times of day . Fortunately , the game also features a single-player game mode , allowing you to play single games against a computer-controlled opponent . It also has a single player 'speed game ' mode where the object is to simply sink all the balls as fast as possible . The game features a handful of different tables to randomly play , and a multitude of different cues and custom balls that can be purchased with currency won within the game . These items can also be purchased through microtransactions , which may seem like it makes the game pay-to-win . Yes , all of the cues have different attributes that can make the game easier , but a good player can have great success with even the most basic cues . Fortunately , the in-game currency is not hard to come by freely , and the game also gives everyone daily random gifts & rewards for playing online matches . Pool aficionados may be put-off by the basic nature of the game , but it 's a great game for casual fans and unpretentious gamers looking for a fun way to waste a few minutes here & there .

The HOG scenes themselves were somewhat on the small side but with a few puzzle features in the mix . There were puzzles throughout the game as is in most HOGs and mostly simple though I came across a couple that I needed to auto solve and I hate to do that . The two in question I could not figure out and the hints were not really helpful but this may be due to what I believe is that English is not the native language of whoever wrote the lines in this game . This is not really a complaint just something I noticed and I believe effected my puzzle solving satisfaction , but my lack of skill in solving puzzles may have played a larger role for me . I 'm not the best in solving puzzles but I am pretty good at them nonetheless . Story was OK but I don 'y feel right to talk about it as I might let something slip and that would take away someone 's enjoyment . I found the voice work good over all but some minor sync issues which did not kill the game for me . Graphics were nice and even better than I expected . I only wish that the HOG scenes themselves were more robust as some of them were too simplistic . For the price of this game you are getting a great deal in my opinion and you should not pass this one up . This is for when you want an easier going HOG and not tax the old noggin . Hope you enjoy as I sure did . I usually don 't replay these games and I myself am not an achievement hunter but since I 'm only missing three I 'm going to hit this again .

130,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/insanitysmuse/recommended/432370,insanitysmuse,432370,This is another great example of an experience that 's really only possible through a game . It is rough around the edges but I loved it early on , I did have to look up something near the end because I thought I was giving the right answer but was off slightly . The biggest flaw it has is looking at the notebook takes you away from the terminal and vice versa , it seems like it wouldn 't have been that difficult to implement having both on screen and make the overall experience a lot smoother . If you have a passing interest in languages or linguistics , it 's an interesting experience though for sure .
131,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kmcbride/recommended/312750,kmcbride,312750,The definitive FFIV experience . Voice acting in key scenario scenes , crisp polygonal graphics with charming pixelated textures , a flowing version of the ATB battle system , Augment battle abilties that add strategy for experienced players ... It goes on from here . Take heed , it 's a nightmare to set up alternative control methods due to Square Enix 's shoddy launch program . If you intend to play with a keyboard or with an Xbox 360 controller , you won 't have issues with the default controls . Changing the controls and using a third party controller makes things annoying and difficult . Shame they didn 't put as much effort into the launch program as they did the rest of the game .

The game takes place literally in 30 minutes , and achievements , drop out for anything . Going into the game , we understand that " it " positions itself as the first chapter , but on the store page there is not a word about it . In general , about this nowhere a word . The gameplay is clumsy and boring . Textures of enemies cause sadness and disappointment . And the dialogues are not afraid of this conclusion , they are written by children , maybe someone else is less . A lot of grammatical errors . I do not want to see this in the Steam , I do not want to play it , I do not want it to be bought . Definitely a huge minus . Please do not buy this .

Then we get enemies like SWAT turrets and Captain Winters that give players who didn 't purchase DLC with explosives or fire a really tough time . And now we are here , during CrimeFest , a whole week of FREE stuff added to the game . Except , you know , the CS :GO unboxing {?} t they put out on the FIRST DAY . If you unbox something , it has a chance to have higher stats , which gives other players a higher advantage (similar to owning certain DLC ). It doesn 't help that they worked around a bunch of the weapons stats , making many good weapons terrible and many okay weapons OP . Also , if you unbox a weapon that is DLC , you can 't use it .

If you pick this up you 'll be spending a lot of time playing community created tracks and there are a ton of them . Almost all the ones I tried are very well done . Distance plays more like a platformer than a racer at times so it would help if you 're more into doing awesome stuff with a car than racing . Although this should be obvious since it 's a flying car .

So what sets this one apart ? Is there anything , really ? Surprisingly , yes . In typical Sakura fashion , you have the option to pursue multiple girls . While Sakura Santa is short (even by Sakura standards ), You do get a few options / choices this go round . There 's the lewd fox spirit , your childhood friend , and Santa herself . Each route was cute in it 's own way . One is a bit lewd still , but the others were more heart warming than I expected . Don 't get me wrong , the game is still chock full of the weird , clumsy girls tripping and exposing panties and breasts and whatnot that we all know and love . Yet this time , I actually found myself wanting to see how things ended with the different girls . Maybe it 's because the focus is Christmas , but this title seemed a little less . . . over-the-top . That said , there 's still a harem ending and plentiful CGs . Most are a little risque to where you don 't want your family to see , but typically the " ending " CGs were more cutey than booty .

Either way , you 'll be pressing J a lot to load the next system sorry no you 're " engaging the ftl drive to hyperjump " ... so yes , Press J to load a system , click either an asteroid , other ship or cargo in that system then turn around and press J some more . The most depressingly shallow and dissappointing gaming experience I 've encountered . People say it 's not a game for instant gratification and those who like things easy , press J , nothing can kill you , nothing is dangerous , complex mechanics requiring skill ? there are NONE , just levelling up to beat other people in dogfights , pressing J to Explore , Pressing J to haul cargo . Nothing is a threat , nothing is 'in depth ' your 1300th hour will be exactly the same as your first . Look but fdon 't touch , press J a lot .

Driving is probably a little too realistic (aka bad handling since it 's older cars ) Storyline is your average mobster flick , except with less focus on you rising through the ranks ; more the story of the average Joe (haha you 'll get it if you play ). I would recommend it , but I also warn you that the replayability is practically none and once you beat it , the fun pretty much stops . The DLC are all " meh " .

Sean 's dad (which is hilariously portrayed as a stereotypical Mexican ) makes a remark about Donald Trump 's presidency and how it turned America into quite " dangerous place " , even tho the game takes place one week before presidential elections of 2016 (+A writing devs lul ) Sean 's neighbour is a white male (prolly also straight and priviledged ) who gets his {?} beaten after bullying Sean 's 'lil bro and making racist remarks towards their ethnicity . White police officer is portrayed as stereotypical racist cop who don 't hesitate to shoot at people of minority , then he gets slaughtered in rather glorified way . The hillbilly guy (He's white of course ) that you meet at the gas station accuses Sean of stealing (even tho I didn 't steal anything in my playthrough ) and makes racist remarks towards Sean 's and his 'lil bro 's ethnicity . The hillbilly guy proudly mentions the " Trump Wall " saying people such as Sean (minorities/ people of mixed ethnicity ) are the reason why the wall needs to be built in the first place . The fat bearded soyboy (who's actually a cool character TBH ) who saves Sean and his 'lil bro , tells him that the local rednecks are so much biggoted that they 're more afraid of seeing mexicans / minorities rather than sasquatch itself . The way LiS 2 turned out to be so " political " is just meme-worthy .

207,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/4453776/recommended/420530,4453776,420530,This game is almost revolutionary in way . It 's true breaking the fourth wall isn 't something new but this game takes it to a whole perspective , the game knows and recognizes you exist . The interesting thing about that is the game talks you in ways many other games similar cant do , like undertale . Undertale becomes really bland after playing this game especially how this game handles it 's gameplay . Undertale is just another rpg with simple endings . This game has rich characters even though they might look bland a first glance but once you gone through the game multiple times you start to see what the characters are really like . Right now to be honest writing review this in-depth to show my love for this and it 's wonderful community it gathered , is really hard because I can 't just spoil the game in this . I want you to have a chance to experience it and see for yourself . Like I said earlier it 's revolutionary game that changes people 's opinion of how the fourth wall should be use instead of talking a little bit the player . Just play the game and enjoy . Hey , I 'm not saying that undertale is bad , I never found it to be immerising to the player . It 's not a one size fit all , so if you don 't like it 's your fault because 1. you 're closed minded , 2. you 've never played these type of games , 3. You 're from a toxic community , or 4. Your standards are to high for a simple game . ;3

212,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/heybabyxxx/recommended/362960,heybabyxxx,362960,I used to enjoy these cRPGs , many years ago _ my favorite one being ¡°Torment¡±. But bad experiences with titles like ¡°Neverwinter Nights ¡± and ¡°Baldur's Gate ¡± made me fall out of love with the genre . Now I 'm making my peace with it again thanks to this very good product (that I only tried because of 2018 's Spring Cleaning Event ) and I can 't wait to play other titles , like ¡°Pillars of Eternity ¡± and the ¡°Divinity¡± series . For starters , it took me 75 minutes for character creation alone , which I thought was amazing . You decide your own backstory , and this will influence (apparently, in a significant degree ) your playthrough . You will have to ally yourself with one of two main factions or go alone _ and each one of these decisions seems to take you to different routes . Besides doing all the quests , I finished with only 33% of the achievements , so there 's a lot I didn 't experience . My only playthrough took 72 hours (I played without any DLC , so no companion quests , unfortunately ). The lore is rich , the writing (by Matt MacLean , also author of the not so good ¡°Alpha Protocol ¡±) is above standard and voice acting is top notch (specially by Debra Wilson , who plays a beastwoman in a marvelous beastly way ). Combat was challenging in a few spots early on , but after Kills-in-Shadow joined it became a smooth ride , because I had two tanks (her and Barik ) engaging the enemy and two healers / supporters / range attackers (the main character and Lantry ). I barely used Eb and Sirin , with Verse being retired early , because she was too much like my main character . There 's great variety in levelling up your party , with lots of perks to unlock and items to forge . Also , the spell-making system is the deepest I 've seen . The effects of your reputation are also relevant . I roleplayed it in a very sensible way , uniting with the strongest faction and avoiding recklessness , but it must be fun to go on the anarchist path , {?} everybody off . Maybe in a few years I 'll give this another try . And I hope they make a sequel , because I really want to bring the fight to that {?} Kyros . In a nutshell , it 's a complex and ambitious game that 's not frustrating . Kudos to the developers for achieving this . It 's worth its full price .

233,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fr0sent_Lucifer/recommended/204100,fr0sent_Lucifer,204100,A small background : The story of Max begins with the fact that in the beginning of the first part several addicts break into his house and kill his wife and daughter . After that , Max becomes an agent of the " Office of Drug Control (DEA)" to conduct his war against drug traffickers . Some time later , someone kills Alex Balder , Max 's partner , and substitutes it . He begins to search for policemen and he , forced to hide , begins his own investigation . Regarding the gameplay and graphics : Shootings with slowing down the time are truly breathtaking . In addition to all the first in the series appeared a system of shelters . Prior to the release , many scolded this idea . Like it will make the game very easy and kill the gameplay . And of course it was all wrong . First , no one forces you to use it . This is just another possibility . Secondly , at the last level of complexity , the game is very difficult and without hiding 100% is indispensable . In Max Payne 3 , developers were able to create a very good artificial intelligence , so that the enemies are very smart . If Rockstar had not added a system of shelters , then it would have been at least not fair on their part . For the game is really difficult . One of the strengths of Max Payne 3 is the graphics . The level of detail and realism that Rockstar recreated is truly amazing . That attention to the environment , to objects and every little thing there makes us applaud standing up . When you look at the characters , sometimes you can not even tell the difference from reality . Summing up . Rockstar again was able to prove that in the creation of third-person shooters they are kings . Excellent detailed plot and skilful submission , addictive gameplay , stunning graphics and the best optimization in gambling inuistry . And of course our beloved Max Payne (Though slightly older and also a drunkard ) and branded Bullet Time . My personal score : 10 out of 10 drunk Payne

The game has a silly over-the-top humor , with seagulls that fly across the board to attack other players , a hamster-like character that speaks in a foreign language and likes to rob others , and a female Santa Claus with rabbit ears who fends off attackers by hitting them with her present bag . In short : It 's a lot of fun , unless you somehow hate anime , or cute characters . What I like the most about this game (aside from the humor ) is its perfect balance between strategical depth and RNG : On one hand , analyzing the parameters over which the player has control can be quite interesting , and you can spend a lot of time with meta analysis , if you like doing this . On the other hand , there are a lot of things that are outside the player 's control . While you can gain a bit of an edge with smart decisions , you 're still at the mercy of the RNG . Put together , this makes for a game that can be enjoyable for both strategists and casual players , without being too onesided . And if you like roguelikes , you 're probably happy to read that the game can throw you in a lot of different situations , where you have to improvise with the " items " (cards) on your hand in creative ways , or make an educated guess . At its core , the game is quite simple : Players take turns , and roll a D6 to move forward on the board , and the panel they land on determines if they gain or lose stars , draw a card , or if other things happen . Players can also battle other players , allowing them to steal their stars and gain points if they KO them . To win , players need to level up a certain number of times by landing on a player home panel with the required stars or battle points . While this may sound a bit boring , there 's much more beyond this . First of all , the game has a very interesting deck mechanic , where players create or choose a deck of 10 cards before the start of a game . However , the cards from all players are shuffled into a common deck . So , to build an efficient deck , you can 't just add cards that are good for your character ; you also have to consider how bad (or good ) it is if other players draw those cards , which , btw ., is the far more likely outcome with 4 players . The cast of characters is quite diverse , with each character having different stats , an exclusive hyper card that (usually) only this character can draw , and sometimes a passive ability . The character diversity results in very different playing styles or card synergies , which keeps the game fresh . The battle system is simple , yet elegant : The challenger rolls a D6 for attack , and the challenged player chooses to defend or evade , before rolling a D6. Then roles swap , and the challenged player is allowed to counterattack . The rolls are modified by the character stats , potentially played start-of-battle cards , and sometimes other factors . Since character stats are very small numbers , it 's possible to estimate the risk of challenging another player quite well , except for potential cards that the other player may play . Now , the battle system is a bit more than just a gimmick thrown into the game for some forced chaotic interaction : Some characters are good attackers , while others are good defenders , or star gatherers (which is a bit of an oversimplification ). In addition , characters pose more or less of a threat depending on their HP , card hand , character level , board position , and how much they need your stars . Sometimes it 's safer to attack someone , because passing them would allow them to attack first . Sometimes , you want to attack someone , because it allows you to stop on their panel . And sometimes you don 't want to pass another player , because you know the other player will attack you to land on your panel . There 's a lot more to say about the game mechanics , like thoughtful pathing , resource management (cards vs stars ), and the many ways cards and active events have an impact on the game . Figuring out how to build a good deck for certain characters , or to play them well can be an interesting , non-trivial challenge . But , as mentioned at the beginning , there 's only so much that a player can influence : While the game has a lot of depth , playing well is often countered by bad luck , and vice-versa . If you expect that the best player wins , this is not the game for you . If you enjoy meta analysis , and are pleased to win slightly more often if you play well , you might enjoy this game . And if you just want to have some silly fun while chatting with other players , without having to think too much about the deeper aspects , this game has you covered . While the game has a singleplayer mode , I mostly played it to unlock some things , for a challenge , and to try out things offline . The AI is very limited : It gets most of the basic things right , but plays cards completely randomly , and makes poor risk management decisions . In the singleplayer campaign , the difficulty setting determines how much the AI player rolls are rigged (the final boss even makes a comment about this ^_^). You can get some enjoyment out of singleplayer mode , but it probably won 't last long . The developers / publishers seem to care a lot about the game , are active on the community boards , and keep updating the game with bug fixes , new characters and voices , or seasonal events with special rules and obtainable cosmetics , and so on . My experience while playing with strangers has been good -- particularly during seasonal events -- and finding new friends to play with isn 't difficult with this community . Regarding DLC : There is a lot of DLC , but IMO the only essential DLCs are the two card packs . The (Japanese) voice packs are worth it as QoL features , if you care about this . For new players , the base game already has a lot of characters (18, some of which have to be unlocked ). So the character DLCs aren 't necessary , and I exclusively played base game characters for a long time , even though I owned some of the DLC characters (which often are a bit more difficult to play for someone who is new to the game ). Note that two character DLCs (Breaker & Witch Pack ) add a new campaign , each , in case this is important for you . While I ended up buying all DLC , I did it because I wanted it , and not because I felt I needed it to enjoy the game , and because I wanted to support the developer / publisher . The only two bad things I can think of off the top of my head (ignoring minor issues ) are : 1 ) The manual is outdated , confusing , and contains a crucial mistake that caused me to misunderstand one of the core mechanics . But there 's a good beginner 's guide on Steam , and the game has a link to an extensive wiki . 2 ) It takes some time to unlock all cards and characters . I personally don 't care about the latter , but I found it a bit annoying that I couldn 't just freely build my deck for a tank character , until I unlocked several rare HP recovery cards , which are more or less mandatory for such a character .

The story is like every possession & murder story and a little bit less . Nothing feels truly shocking in this game . Honestly , I wanted to like this game , but I just couldn 't. I wouldn 't try this as your first pixelated horror game .

242,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ivanleterrible/recommended/250320,ivanleterrible,250320,Amazing dark cartoonish storytelling game ! Story The Wolf Among Us is a kind of a mix between an interactive story and a videogame . The whole story is somehow difficult to explain , but its set up in a fictional New York where the character from the Brothers Grimm fairy tails have migrated seeking refuge . The main protagonist is Bigby Wolf , who once was the Big Bad Wolf from the fairytails , but now he tries to be the good guy working as a sheriff in this town . Things start to get scarier as some members of the community start to get murdered for unknown reasons and this threat might even reach Bigbys close ones , such as his collegue and love interest Snow White . Game play The gameplay is divided in three main sections : exploration ; where you investigate places looking for clues ; dialogues , where you choose from usualy four options to set the pace of the conversation ; and quick time events , which take place in most action scenes . Now , I really dont like quick times events , but there is usually only one or two action scenes per chapter , so it didn 't spoil my experience . Veredict Overall , I really enjoyed this game , it was really great and deep , made me feel chills over my spine quite a few times , the story is rich but easy to catch and the character Bigby is very well build , with his contraditions of being the Big Bad Wolf turned into a law agent . I strongly recommend this game . Just wish it would be longer ... I give it 5.0/5.0

245,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/scissormarks/recommended/486310,scissormarks,486310,Meadow is not about anything , there is no real end game , but it is a nice , atmospheric social experience , where you meet other players , pack up and try to communicate with the very limited tools you have been given . The game can seem really slow at times , and that makes sense when you are trying to work together with a group of +15 random strangers you have just encountered . There is a real sense of mystery and wonder to the game , and as you work together as a pack to achieve your goals , you will walk away from the game with a new perspective of what friendship means . Can suggest trying this out .

252,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zoburg/recommended/730,zoburg,730,I used to recommend against this game , but now I have to recommend it , after playing 83 hrs of r6s , this game is actually pretty balanced , like most halfs you finish 7-8 , unless the other team has a smurf or your team has a thrower , while in r6s theres not a single ounce of balance , ash is dirty op , with her {?} ing nonexisting hit boxxes , the ubishit servers and peekers advantage , when you get down to it this is a simple game , that takes skill , no confusing map layouts (a few exeptioons , but you ussually learn them in 7 rounds unlike r6s ), callouts are easy , your team actually uses mics , and you can mute people and vote kick people , now in r6s there is no vote kick in comp , no lie I had a guy on my team telling the enemy team where everyone was on our team , and we couldn 't do 5/8ths of f-ck all , we could report him but thats a joke , in this game you report someone who 's hacking they will get banned , the people who made this game (valve), is so on top of their ban game that I had a picture of a cat with a nazi arm band , and I got my profile pic removed and a 2 week no pic ban , ubisoft wouldn 't even take off the profile pic . tldr : if you want a decent 5 v 5 competitive fps game , get this not r6s , this is way more optimized , more balanced , and the community is like a bag of salt free chips compared to that of r6s , where they expect you to know every call out when you play the map once
253,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/KronicDreamz/recommended/70400,KronicDreamz,70400,Wonderful game with an incredible amount of depth and character .

254,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/radslag/recommended/241600,radslag,241600,Rogue Legacy is incredible . While it visually doesn 't look like much , the mechanics make the most addictive old school game I 've played in a very long time . Essentially what Cellar Door Games ahs done is fuse the most fun mechanical elements of multiple 2d genres into a delightful play loop that can last you dozens of hours . Rogue Legacy has very tight 2d platformer controls coupled , roguelike permadeath , lots of loot with light metroidvania exploration randomized dungeons . But the real secret sauce is the inclusion of RPG leveling mechanics that allow your progess to pass onto your " descendents " , making their run a little easier than yours . This really helps take the brutal edge of dejection off the roguelike gameplay as now each death / failed run into the castle now has long term benefits . Throw in the game 's whimsical sense of humor in heritable traits and you 'll never have so much fun failing hundreds of time in a game .

260,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/clef/recommended/253250,clef,253250,(I play mainly on my DRM-free copy without steam , so hours of play are not correctly represented ) I backed this one on kickstarter years ago , and believed it was yet another game that would never be finished . However something magical happened ... these guys actually delivered where so many others failed ! (See timber &stone, castle story , clockwork empires ). Ok , the truth is that , just like those other games , development of this one will stop before the game achieves its full potential or the things that were promised . But this one is a game that deserves the " 1.0 " version number ; it 's perfectly playable and offers a fun sandbox experience with just enough goals to make you want to complete the tech trees over and over again (which is something I cannot say for games which are more complex but also become tedious after the first play ). The animations , sound and overall presentation is also very satisfying with those little " tactile " details like watching your guys move stuff around , kicking up dirt , chat idly , etc . which really makes all feel more alive . Also , as far as I know , this is the only modern " colony simulator " with actually working multiplayer (the feature that is always requested by fans of these games , but never delivered ) and an easy to use 3d voxel building system . So if either of those are things you were looking for , this may be your only choice for that niche !

Deep Space Waifu now has a medieval skin to it ! If you 've played any of the Deep Space Waifu games , then you know exactly what you 're getting with this one ...that said , I 'll try to keep this short to prevent redundancy . You play as an anthropomorphic bear trying to strip some giant sexy girls while defeating tiny enemies that roam the screen . You can even play this one-handed ...for the pervs out there that want to thoroughly " enjoy " the gameplay . For the most part , it 's the same as any other Deep Space Waifu game . What makes Deep Space Waifu : FANTASY unique shouldn 't come as any surprise . Where Deep Space Waifu : Flat Justice implemented a story mode (that the original lacked ), Deep Space Waifu : FANTASY continues with a story of its own of an almost completely unrelated plot . Same character , different story , different waifus , but still the same game ...it's all a matter of tastes . Though , this " FANTASY " now implements a new world map interface for your experience . That 's probably the most significant change . The humor is still lewd and the waifus are still waifus . So , would I recommend it ? Well ...kinda' a grey area this time . Yes , it 's a good game , but it 's more-or-less the same game , just with a different skin . Fortunately , I enjoy the medieval setting in general . Some people , however , may be bothered that there 's nothing really new this time around other than the new skin ...and I wouldn 't blame them for thinking like that . Pick it up if you 're interested , but you 'll be completely done with it in 2 hours . Goes on sale for $2, worth that much , but wouldn 't go lower than $1.50 for a sales price . 6/10 It 's not bad . I like the waifus , but the lack of much new content leaves this as a bittersweet experience . (I was spoiled by the previous incarnations )

Pros : +Nostalgic aesthetic that is consistent and wonderful throughout +Mechanics are solid and allow for multiple solutions , routes , and preferential choice +Plenty of hidden spots and secrets +All elements would be found in the most polished of retro games +Interestingly varied boss fights +That soundtrack is amazing . At worst is mediocre , at best is catchy and awesome to listen to . Cons : -Occasionally you may get lost (rarely for more than 5 or 6 minutes ) -Inconsistent difficulty (not a problem for me personally ) -Save / respawn system should be linked to the warp system and allow for more warps (it was frustrating travelling across the map over and over ); deaths and respawn fade ins / outs could be quicker =Ending was either meh or I am oblivious and didn 't get it . I 'm pretty dull , so it wouldn 't surprise me . Overall I loved the experience . It was very charming and may get more playthroughs from me as time goes on . 8/10 is probably a fair rating for it
281,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/manicado/recommended/579180,manicado,579180,<url> Ys VIII : Lacrimosa of Dana has you participate in the story of Adol and Dana , the two main characters , while being able to alternate between them and a multitude of other characters in order to unravel and experience a deep and memorable plot involving the fate of the world . The cursed Seiren Island is an open world environment you can roam while taking down various monsters and enemies . Players meet new friends along with exploring and collecting materials for use in crafting healing items and stronger weapons . The game opens with you , as Adol , on-board a famous ship , the Lombardia , which sadly doesn 't get to the destination he was headed for . The player crashes near an unknown island (called the Isle of Seiren ), where they struggle to survive and unearth many mysteries while saving people scattered around different locations . -- POSITIVES -- Dual story-lines and emotional journey The majority of the time you are in control of Adol , but there 's a period of the story-line where you go travel through time in order to relive Dana 's life that led to her becoming the Maiden of the Forest . This adds to the backstory and depth of the plot , making the world feel detailed and fleshed out as it allows you to play it rather than simply explain Dana 's backstory through dialogue . Throughout the whole playthrough , the plot evoked many emotions that were flowing within me . Whether it would be happiness to the extreme or the contrary being extreme sadness . The story in this game provides you with a beautiful journey and emotional roller-coaster . Endearing characters You 'll meet a wide range of characters , from ones you want to hug to others which you want to punch in the face . Normally , you 'd wish the annoying characters would not exist but Ys VIII does a great job of eventually making you attached to everyone , even the ones you dislike . You learn more about them as Adol includes more into the party from either his fellow castaways or residents of the island , and realize that each has something to contribute to exposition for the plot (such as Laxia , a noblewoman , providing information on Eternia ). Entrancing music The musical score in Ys VIII is simply outstanding and superb , the team at Falcom and Yukihiro Jindo (the composer ) has produced music which has left a mark on me months after playing . I often find myself listening to the official soundtrack and humming Dana 's theme to myself when I 'm working on various tasks . Each song and sound really enhances the experience during gameplay and provides a perfect complement for the fantasy nature of the world . Areas , exploration and maps The Isle of Seiren doesn 't skimp out with places to explore and different varieties of locations . There 's one point where you can even go underwater thanks to a handy relic which takes it beyond just land-based combat . There 's huge mountains , dense forests , dark caverns , boggy marshlands and so much more which really adds to the immersive nature of the open world genre . The variety of beautiful locations makes you awe in the design of it all , as well , as you can tell that the team at Falcom really wished to convey a sense of nature-meets-magic . Longevity Lacrimosa of Dana provides a real in-depth story and lasting narrative . Fortunately , at no point did the story feel like it was dragging on and it flows nicely through the course of 30 hours or so ; yet , neither did it feel as if it was too short or left with any kind of cliffhanger . Ys VIII also provides a true ending for completing most of what the game has to offer , so it gives you more motivation to go through every nook and cranny of the Seiren Island . Building up a base , surviving , and friend quests Upon crashing onto the Isle of Seiren , you 're automatically plunged into a scenario which brings you back to having nothing . With the survivors , you can gather items and materials to build up the base and defenses as well as helping survivors with their quests and needs . This is a great amount of content that 's been integrated into the Seiren Islands and gives the player lots to do to fill up gameplay . It wasn 't too overdone and quests weren 't repeated too much to make the game feel padded and instead felt organic as any hero adventurer traveling through a fantasy universe would since helping villagers and solving mysteries . -- NEGATIVES -- Attention-seeking Raids Every time I got engrossed and wanted to explore more , the little parrot would beep up and say ¡°Alert! Alert ! Camp is under attack ¡±. While I believe you don 't have to do them , I didn 't want to take any chances and found myself constantly teleporting back to a ¡®defend the base ' type mini-game , which I 'm not really a fan of . That being said , if you enjoy 'defend the base ' type missions , this may be a positive for you . This may seem like nitpicking but when something detracts away from my exploring to do a mundane task such as this then it has a negative impact on me . Predictability of boss fights Every single boss fight on Ys VIII is extremely predictable in terms of when they will show up . I found myself knowing and stocking up before each and every boss on the game . This took away from the element of surprise and made sure I was fully prepared for each and every encounter as there is no point at anytime that I was caught off guard . If there were more unexpected boss battles then it would add to a more challenging gameplay instead of ensuring I was always prepared . Many players may feel like this is a sort of hand-holding . Customization is just a palette swap When I unlocked the tailor I got extremely excited upon hearing of character customization . Excluding the DLC , the customization was a major let down as the different outfits were just color swaps of their regular uniforms . While I understand being limited on the physical side of character customization , I really wish that the outfits actually changed instead of being just a simple color change . Accidental special usage I found that when playing on PS4 , to activate a special ability you need to press L1 and R1 together to activate it . The control scheme also has the dodge button on L1 and block on R1 , which could cause the player to accidentally activate the special at times when it 's not needed . This , during more action-packed fight sequences , was a bit frustrating due to the fact that special attacks took a while to build up and could also save you from potential death situations in a pinch . PC Port Issues While this is a more technical point to the review , many people who have played the PC ported version thus far are having issues with it being buggy , crashing , glitching , and not acting how it should . I 'm one of the fortunate few who 've encountered zero problems in either version of the title , however , I felt it was worth noting here -- for anyone considering to get it for PC -- that many have noticed this and that it 's still unknown whether it has to do with the build of your computer or some other yet-unrealized software issue . -- CONCLUSION -- It 's not often you come across masterpieces , but Ys VIII : Lacrimosa of Dana is simply breathtaking and provided a voyage which has left a lifelong and emotional mark on me . There is minor annoyances to be mentioned for the game but none have seriously impacted my love for it as all the positives far outshine the negatives . From the wide range of characters to the scenery and an out-of-this-world musical score , I highly recommend this as a purchase to anyone who enjoys action RPGs that contain an in-depth story and fun gameplay . Ys VIII : Lacrimosa of Dana is simply one of the best games that I 've ever encountered and played in my life .

283,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/208110,stumpo,208110,First , I just wanted to say that I am a great fan of the Myst series and if you have not played Myst through Myst IV , you should start with realMyst Masterpiece Edition . I entirely recommend the games up until this point and nothing I 'm about to say should be taken to be criticism of the series as a whole . Below I discuss elements from the previous Myst games . I can 't recommend Myst V because I do not think it is a good sequel to the series , and because I don 't think on its own there is much to recommend . The game is shorter , slighter , easier , and less interactive than any of the previous games , and despite being position as an " end " to the Myst storyline , does very little to engage with other titles in the series . The premise is simple : Much time has passed since Myst IV . You (I am made to understand that the player character here differs from the previous games , but this is irrelevant and the game is unclear about this ) arrive in K 'veer, Atrus ' study area seen in previous games . You quickly meet a much older Yeesha , Atrus ' daughter . She is crazy , delivers a long monologue , and then warps you to the old , dead D 'ni age . There , you immediately meet a guy named Esher , who is a D 'ni. He tells you not to trust Yeesha and then delivers a long , crazy sounding monologue . You now need to visit a series of ages to get tablets to get some dongle (called a Tablet , but not the tablets you 've been using the whole game ). Yeesha tells you not to give the dongle to her . Esher tells you not give the dongle to her , and also to give it to him , because it will grant him infinite power . It 's all a little on the nose . There is nothing resembling a plot for the rest of the game , and then in the ending you choose what to do with the dongle . Other than a passing reference and Yeesha 's existence , the game does not connect to Riven , Myst 3 , or Myst 4. I am told the game connects more to Uru , which I have not played . The previous games sketched out their story , history , and worlds through diaries . Here , we find 12 of Yeesha 's diaries in the caverns leading to D 'ni. What does she have to say ? Not really anything , it 's mostly just nutcase rambling and mythology dump that never comes into play in the game . There is a puzzle solution in one of the journals -- a throwback to earlier Myst games if ever there was one -- but it feels less organic . The other ages contain no items , journals , writing , or really anything to tell you much . Instead , information is conveyed by Esher giving long , boring monologues . The endings discuss these elements as though the player was invested . I was not . The game is in full 3D . It actually looks remarkably good . The environments are clean and the designs are beautiful as always . I uploaded a few dozen screenshots and I have nothing bad to say about the environmental graphics . The character models are disappointing ; low polygon , sub-Half-Life 2 era 3D models with stilted animation . Is it fair to judge the game today when it was made almost 15 years ago ? Yes . All of the other games hold up visually in their old way . To put it simply , replacing digital actors with 3D models is a little like George Lucas talking about how the CG in the Phantom Menace is better than the traditional models and animatronics . It 's not true , and even a few years removed from the game 's release it looks obviously dated . This is compounded by the overall poor direction -- character voice actors deliver bland line readings as they pace back and forth in place . You can 't skip text or move around during it . Just an epic disappointment , really . There was one character model which , to talk about it would be a spoiler , but my heart literally sank in my stomach when I saw it . As a long term fan , it 's all so sad . The choice to go 3D impacts everything else as well . The node-based navigation is an unfun afterthought , but 3D movement is not much better . The character 's walking speed is too slow , the running speed is too fast , and the physics are off so going down stairs too quickly makes you mysteriously float . The developers compensate for this by making passages wide and open , which then gives the world an emptier feeling . I am not sure if the choice to go 3D impacted the puzzle design , but I can tell you that there is little puzzle design . Virtually every puzzle in the game revolves around either finding a hidden switch , or finding a symbol written in the wall and regurgitating it in the right place . There are easily fewer than 10 real puzzles in the game . It 's really too bad . When the game started and I got the opportunity to explore the caverns leading down to D 'ni, I was extremely excited ... until I got to the bottom and there was nothing there and not even really any puzzles . As far as I can tell , the design effort went to adding a tablet mechanic . You carry a tablet on which you can draw , using your mouse , symbols . If you then put the tablet on the ground and walk away , an alien friend will teleport in , look at the tablet , and if he understands the symbol , do something . The game is built around this and it 's a deeply bad mechanic . I understand what they wanted to achieve -- take the notion of writing and language that is so important to the series and put them in direct control of the player . But it is a failed execution on several levels . First , the symbol detection is awful . At the end of the first age , a puzzle requires you to draw a symbol . My first time through it took me 14 tries to draw the symbol correctly and I could not tell you what I did differently when it eventually worked . In the next age , I drew a symbol thinking it would be a puzzle solution -- unfortunately the game interpreted the symbol incorrectly and promptly made me skip the entire age . It was impossible to undo this decision , meaning I had to replay a decent chunk of the game to restore from an earlier save . Let 's imagine that the writing recognition worked . Would this be a good mechanic ? No . Largely writing is inconvenient , carrying the tablet around and dropping it when you need to climb ladders feels awful , it takes up a non-trivial portion of your viewport making it harder to enjoy the world design . The symbols themselves do almost nothing . Each age has one symbol that does something to the age 's climate . You use it once or twice in appropriate places . Each age has 3-4 symbols which warp the tablet to a pedestal somewhere in the age . These are generally used in a boring way . There are two special symbols that are a part of solving puzzles (at least the way I solved them ). And ... that 's the ballgame . You never need to apply knowledge from other ages . I took a total of two pages of notes , most of them symbols to write on the slate -- in general Myst games take 6-10 pages of notes . Although you can do the ages in any order , the game has an intended order . At the end of one age , dialogue makes it clear this is supposed to be the first age . At the end of another , dialogue makes it clear that this is supposed to be the second age . And at the end of what it assumes is the fourth age , you get a bunch of pre-ending dialogue . Hope you didn 't pick the wrong order , otherwise this dialogue would seem like random nonsense . Oops . The music goes for more an ambient vibe , like Myst and Riven , then the Jack Wall scores from 3 and 4. I prefer ambient music , but found the music here bland and could not hum or tell you anything about the music . There is an element in the game 's bad endings that is an interesting and heartbreaking callback to the series as a whole . If you look it up online , you 'll see what it is . Seeing something you love in ruins is really a metaphor for this game . For anyone reading , play realMyst , Riven , Myst 3 , and Myst 4 instead . If you finish those , I would move onto Obduction , Cyan Worlds ' recent game , which looks and plays great and is a worthy followup . If instead you play Myst V , I hope you don 't let it tarnish your memories of the past .

Quantum Break is certainly an interesting experiment . Part TV Show . Part videogame (although mostly game of course ). It is a game that blends the weighty storytelling of a weekly drama with the action of a game and does it pretty well . The good : - The cast . An A-list cast bring this together both in live action form and in video game motion capture / voice acting . - Visuals . The game - especially the actor models - look and animate incredibly well . - The story : It is certainly interesting andf I always want to know what is around the next turn . - Action . Combat feels like an evolution of Max Payne . Instead of random slowdowns , you now have superpowers . Some are more useful for platforming or puzzle zolving (which isnt an emphasis here ) and others are better showcased in combat . All-in-all it feels pretty good . - Choose your own adventure moments . Select at the end of each act a course of action that will influence the game and story . - Story is great through to the very end . Cons : - So far the only main grip eI really have is the combat has regenerating health , so if you just avoid enemies for long enough , even big meaty ones , you can just keep shooting and they generally arent as big of a threat as they might otherwise be . That being said I found it fine , personally . A fun game that had a weird pitch / intro , but turns out is actually pretty good .

I liked Sonic Unleased for some reason and SG was good , but I soon stopped playing my 360 and I have not played a Sonic game in years , untill one day Sonic Mania came out and boy was this game good . I have to honesty say this game was a blast to play as it features many of the old classic stages in the Sonic games some from Sonic 1 , 2 , 3 and CD with 2 new stages in the game . The controls are pretty good and easy to use after a few mins of play time , the sound track is great and fun to listen to and the graphics give you the old classic Sonic vibe and such . However there is one problem I do in fact have to say and it 's not about Sonic Mania it 's self , it 's with Sonic Team . Sonic Forces came out a few months after and it got poor reviews and Sonic Mania was made by fans of the classic games and it got much better reviews like this one , so in other words the Sonic fans can make a better Sonic game than Sonic Team and Sega at that and that is saying something , as a matter of fact that says a lot . However I recommend this game to anyone who was a fan of Classic Sonic games and for anyone who wants a taste of the classic Sonic games . Oh and {?} HYDRO CITY .

(i dont mind the download ) but after a few days , the game starts freezing again , which drives you nuts . and if you want , you can repeat the process :D - The game is crashing , yeah , for a lot , and for a lot of weird reasons . 1. not enough memory crash , i have 12GB of ram , and the game is crashing because i dont have enough memory , even if you have 64GB of RAM it will still crash and give you not enough memory message , Fix is , you need to enable PAGE FILE (i know , doesnt make any sense ) set at least 2GB of virtual memory and the game will stop crashing with that error message . 2. the gpu crash , when the game crashes , the screen goes black , and you need to restart your pc , (enabling page file fixes this ) i dont understand that one also . 3. the random crash , i have no idea , regular windows error closed this program ... they happen from time to time , especially if you chat on steam (using the steam overlay ) a lot when you play - The game is lagging , i mean , when you play a faced paced game like this , everyone needs to have a good connection in order for a game to be ok , but that is not the issue 1. i can understand that after 1 year passes the game loses its players 2. there are no dedicated servers , so most of the time you are connected to some guy (who is the server ) 3. half of the players have a bad connection to the server , 2 or 3 bars out of 4 (bars show how good the ping is ) 4. most of the time i have 4 bars (max), and other people are like skipping frames , i see him here , then i see him there 5. in a fast paced game like this it is really hard to play like this - DLC dont work right , i have purchased the extra slots for the armory , and it loaded only after a month (i tried to reinstall the game , switch it on off , restart stuff , it didnt help ) CONCLUSION dont buy this game just because of the multiplayer

There isn 't a vast majority of weapon choices , unlike games such as Call of Duty or Battlefield , but that doesn 't mean they are bad choices . They are definitely practical and you find yourself getting good at using weapons that you didn 't even use before , simply due to this limitation , There is also a buy menu in most games , which is a pretty unique feature for games like this , as it makes the player learn to adapt with what he / she can get . However , I tend to join servers that allow you to spawn with a random primary weapon , simply because it is easier when you want a quick match . If you 're familiar with the Source Engine or the Half-Life series , then I would recommend looking this up ! BOOM , HEADSHOT ! 95/100 !

This allows for more accurate firing and opens up a lot of different ways to take on a boss . the upgrades are really cool , not gonna spoil them but you can buy the from the shop , and the boss are challanging but you can get their patterns down quickly . One thing , I 'm glad there 's upgrades because I hate the standard shot , but it 's not a deal breaker obviously . Defintely reccomend this game .

Runs well on my system - Rarely crashes - Awesome soundtrack - Good graphics - Blood and gore - Each difficulty feels unique and needs to be played differently with your team - SO MUCH GORE - Replayable - Customization - Did I mention the gore ? - 10 Perks each having their own playstyle - Workshop Neutral : - Leveling can feel slow on some Perks . But it teaches you how to play each Perk by actually spending time with each one Cons : - You 're reading my review and not killing Zeds on the Killing Floor :C

DMC " HD " uses original low resolution ps2 movies and same gigantic UI that isn 't widescreen . Textures seem to be a complete cut-copy-paste from console with no visual upgrade whatsoever . Game runs at twice normal speed if using high refresh rate monitor , need to force cap 60fps otherwise it 's completely broken . Resolution capped to 1080p .. If you can overlook these issues that should have been patched prior launch and don 't really care about it truly being HD which it 's not . Then by all means buy , cap to 60fps and enjoy . If never played series before (what's wrong with you ?) it 's well worth your time . Completed games and not super keen to replay ? just wait for sales . Other then finally being released on PC and running at 60fps , it 's really nothing special and borderline false advertising imo . Short game fix guide - > <url>

You play as a creature that looks something like a lemming - and like the lemmings from the game , it plods along regardless of pits or other hazards . So your challenge is to block it , or give it limited commands (on cooldowns ), while mining away hazards that it must pass . The game is played as a series of expeditions , each with a new , progressively deeper and more complex map , and a goal , like freeing a number of your lemming friends . Expeditions are pretty quick to run , but it 's not frantic ; you can generally take some time to look forward on the map and plan a good route down . So far my little guy has no ability to attack the other creatures that infest the maps , but many of the hazards can be turned against the creatures . I also have no ability (so far ?) to climb up , so the map clearing is a one way trip down . Because of the seemingly random nature of the maps , I 've been stuck a few times and couldn 't complete the map goals , but that 's not the end of the world ; a small hit to resources or prestige .

Magic is almost entirely unviable for the boss ; it could be that I was just bad , but it took me many playthroughs to beat the boss , and the only way I could do it was by investing entirely into defense and attack , and saving all of my arrows . Also what was the point of the campfire (and making it lightable ) if it wasn 't a save point ? But all that said , I really liked the game . It just felt a little unfinished . I also was unsure of what " avoid " meant when right-clicking on traps . It just ran me straight into them . Things I liked : Injury system (healing injuries , taking care of toxicity , etc ) Taking care of hunger / thirst The traps and that you can detect and disarm them Doors Things that I would like to see added : Explanation for stats Seeing how your levels would be affected if you were to upgrade certain things (Willpower, etc .) before finalizing your decision Auto-save in case of accidental closing of the game or a confirmation prompt before closing the game More arrows or a way of obtaining or crafting them Explanation of controls and different inventory key Settings page that consists of something other than language Things to know if you 're going to play : Alt +click adds one item to your inventory Shift +click uses item Ctrl +click drops item You can move with the arrow keys Tab switches between loadouts Alt +Enter for fullscreen
369,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gilboron/recommended/72850,gilboron,72850,EDIT : Massive props to Bethesda for admitting they made a mistake ! Mods can no longer be behind paywalls ! [TL;DR: Fixing core game issues can require additional costs in the future , buy another Elder Scrolls game instead .] Overall , my opinion of Skyrim is very mixed , because it has both pros and cons . Let me elaborate . On the positive side of things , Skyrim improves greatly on its predecessors in a lot of ways . Many things are more streamlined or made more consistent , you get a lot more combat options , spells are more unique , and you have the addition of more unique combat encounters in the form of dragons . Radiant quests also make sure you always have something to do , but that brings me to my negative points ... Questlines and characters are , with the exception of the Daedric quests , flat and uninspired . Nothing you do - no matter what the dialogue may imply - has ANY considerable or lasting effect on the world , and that makes it hard to motivate yourself in the end game , when you 're so overpowered that combat is a butchering at best and a slap fight at worst . That 's not the only negative , either - but the other negatives deserve a paragraph of their own , considering recent decisions from Bethesda and Valve . The game is exceedingly glitchy and buggy . On top of that , most of the pros I mentioned are only potential pros , that need a lot of polish to actually lend positivity to the game . This used to be a non-issue thanks to mods - but now , Valve is pushing for modders to put their work behind a paywall . This creates a TON of new issues : fixing game problems can now cost money . And if incompatible mods create a bug , you might have just wasted money , or worse have to spend additional money to fix it . You may argue that this won 't happen to all mods , but consider that sharing resources between modders will become exceedingly rare now that profits are involved . This whole fiasco of a train wreck is essentially a microcosm of everything that 's wrong with modern capitalism . Plus , one mod that EVERYONE considers essential (in fact , a lot of mods require it ), SkyUI , is already going P2P . Honestly , at this rate , I 'd really recommend buying Morrowind or Oblivion instead . Or , hell , I 'd recommend Elder Scrolls Online over this . At least that game is fully functional without potentially requiring additional purchases .

I found Remember Me to be a colossal bore that even with its incredibly short playtime was a chore to play through and I find their Life is Strange games a bit too mawkish and overly-sentimental for my tastes . So blow me over with a feather that Vampyr actually turns out to be surprisingly good , well at least good enough for me to reconsider their games in the future when they aren 't mining adolescence for the nausea-inducing feels . Vampyr had me gripped from the get go , especially given that I was drawn to the bitter irony of the tale that centers around a turn of the century blood transfusion doctor being bitten by a vampire and being turned into one himself and then having to deal with a viral epidemic that threatens to wipe out London , that may or may not be linked to his creator . Vampyr isn 't perfect however as it suffers from what Life is Strange suffered from which is some god awful prose . The game is littered with some clangers that nearly caused my ears to bleed (" What is glass but tortured sand " ; " What is darkness but setting sun " ) but thankfully it 's a lot better this time around . Learning to dial it back a bit is still a lesson the writers at DontNod haven 't quite yet mastered . The combat is also not as refined as it could be (I would describe it as scrappy and rough around the edges ), there are sections of the game that feel a bit graphically underwhelming considering that early 20th century London can look striking when you are out and about questing . There also seems to be an odd problem with engine lighting because each character looks like they are being lit up by an inner lantern dialed all the way up to 10 , with light piercing through the crevices of where they have been stitched together giving each character an odd Frankenstein look . Where Vampyr does excel is that it offers one of largest and most memorable cast of characters I have yet encountered in a game . Each character (and there are many ) are fleshed out and feel distinctly real , not cardboard-caricatures of the era when they aren 't sprouting purple prose . It is also an incredibly focused and tight affair (something I am all the more grateful for ). There is no busy work / fat built in here (unless you plan on healing every citizen in every district ). You have main quests and side quests (all which enhance the main story ) and none of the hundred million other doodahs that seems to populate open world RPG 's these days that simply serve as distractions . Vampyr is also an incredibly well optimized game and I was able to run it without any slow down at 4K / 60FPS . Word of warning :- Vampyr is heavy on exposition and you will often be locked into lengthy pieces of dialog with various characters so if that is not your thing you might want to reconsider . Thankfully all of it is gripping and enjoyable to listen too with enough twists and turns along the way to ensure that , narratively , you are kept on your toes . As it stands , Vampyr gets a recommend from me . One word to sum up the experience Gripping Performance / Bug related incidents No game breaking bugs were encountered outide of the odd engine lighting issue highlighted in the review . Game is incredibly well optimized and should scale admirably on various hardware . Similar to games Vampire : The Masquerade - Bloodlines ; DARK ; Castlevania : Lords of Shadow ; Bloodrayne Suitable for Lovers of all things vampiric , people who enjoy a good yarn , people who love it when their games get a case of the " talkalitis " . Current position in my games of 2018 cleared list 12th position . Rating <url>

There was fun to be had but it just didn 't have the magic of the original (Star Control 2 ). The game played basically the same notes as the original , planet landings for gathering resources and occassional other items of interest , arcade-like space battles , meeting weird aliens , exploring the galaxy and defeating the overarching antagonist but most of these just aren 't quite as good . The best part of the game is the space battles . Good variety , good controls and basically just pretty fun . Unlike the original , there is a greater variety of ship types (in the story portion ) as each alien has around 3 different variants . This adds a lot to the combat but unfortunately these variants aren 't available to the player after allying with them . Other than that the battles are very similar with the major exception being that the space area does not wrap around which does change the tactics quite a bit . The rest of the game is subpar though . Exploring planets is just a chore . The nice 3d planets look good but searching 100 's(?) of these is just not fun . There is little to do on the planets other than to pick up resources or perhaps find the one special location on the planet which 90% of the time is just a free ship . There is no real sense of excitement exploring these and it can take some time to find all the resources . You may not need to do this as much as I did but you will need to do it a lot in the early game for sure which ruins the pacing . They did later patch in a scanner which tells you which planets have something special which was a great time saver though , for me though I was already 50% or more through the game before that happened . The other aspects are fine but nothing special . Exploration should be the best part but other than the main story missions , there isn 't much to do . There is some small side content but it is hard to find and isn 't very rewarding when you do find it . The aliens personalities and quest lines are pretty good , but everything is a bit too lightharded . The original did have large portions that was lighthearted as well but also had scary and wonderous things which this game lacks . So not a glowing review but still some mild fun to be had for the right kind of person . This type of game is quite rare so it has that going for it . Just keep your expectation in check .

This game is unforgiving , and relies on RNG , but i 'd say that it truly becomes hard and unenjoyable if you have no past experience with turn-based RPG , plus if you have poor strategy or just don 't know what you are doing . Darkest Dungeon runs smoothly on my low-end laptop , has godly artstyle , sound , immersion , and is really the only game that got me hooked since a long time .

Although it did hold my attention and has a lot of room for advancement , the cons are just to overbearing to want to play the game right now . At 24.99USD there are plenty of other titles out there that perform better and hold your attention for much longer than STN . Pros : -Great atmospheric enviornment -Optimal future content to look forward to -Developers are hands on with fixing bugs and problems -Graphics are decently presented 7/10 Cons : -Low inventory carrying capability -Crafting system is missing alot and is very buggy at times -Random game crashes -Looting , Feeding , Drinking , Maintaining health and warmth feel like a chore -Looting is practically not there (Check 20 cabinets , Find one Dirty Water ) -Loot Storage is unavailable or will dissapear out of dressors you stored your loot in -Zombies walk through doors and dont even notice you from time to time -Features such as some weapons , tools , generators not implemented or bugged In my opinion this game has a lot of potential and could be one of the better sandbox survival games out there when a lot of these issues are addressed and fixed . Until then , I wouldnt shell out the 25 bucks just yet .

So when I found out that One Piece had a game I of coure wanted to play it as soon as possble and this game is a breath of fresh air , it was also pretty fun and the gameplay was pretty good . However there are a few problems I do in fact have with the game , for starters there is no way for you to memorize the controls of the game because they give you no tutorial for the game so you are complety blind for the game , 2nd the game is a Dyansity Warriors game and I never played a single DW game at all , so One Piece Pirate Warriors 3 is a first timer for me and a game like this can in fact get a bit stale over time , the 3rd thing I should point out is that you should be at Dressrosa before playing or you might be spolled if you play ahead . The final thing I should point out is that the game has a few differnces from the anime a few examples is that Zora is dressed differntly then he is and barry 's are now beils so if small things like that don 't suit you then this game may not be your cup of tea . I recommend this game to One Piece fans and One Piece fans only like myself because if you are not a One Piece fan then you should not play this game because it 's just one of those games for the fans , other then that you should 100% play this game if you like One Piece .

It takes the twin stick shooting of Robotron 2084 , the side scrolling shoot 'em up play of Contra , then adds a nice dash of Gauntlet 's monster portals , and multiple classes . It is then placed in an oven , and baked to a golden brown . After which it is topped with some Rogue like elements like randomized environments , and perma death . Also it is very addictive , and has a challenge level right up there with the Dark Souls games . Ergo , you 're going to lose constantly , but have fun doing it .

393,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/satoruu/recommended/414340,satoruu,414340,The game is short but definitely leaves an impact on you The intro sequence is quiet and understated . Yet it feels so intense and oppressive and sets to mood of the game very well . The theme of mental illness being itertwined with various mythologies is interesting . The combat is simple but that 's not really the point of the game really . The puzzles are more intersteing and weave the mental illness theme as well . While its short , its definitely something to experience .
394,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/morgenmuffel/recommended/639010,morgenmuffel,639010,I really enjoyed the game so far . It nailed the style and the atmosphere of the previous games but I can see why some people are concerned about the gameplay changes . I would have also prevered a traditional control scheme myself but since i have played the demo on PC I can understand the changes . All the manoeuvres from the previous games , like sneak attacks and dodge rolls are still here and work just as good as they used to . Additions like the special abilities and the tactical mode work fine aswell but again as someone , that isn 't really a fan of strategy games I can understand why some people wouldn 't like these . As a big fan of the original Fear Effect games , that just wanted to have a new installment after such a long period of time I actually didn ?t mind all of the changes because of the reason mentioned before . And I think this game so far has succeeded in giving old fans like me a new game of a classic series , while being a good game in its own genre . So overall I can recomend this game to fans of the previous games aswell as people that simply enjoy real time strategy games .

Story is very philosophical and especially the ending makes you speechless for a good 10 minutes . Combat is satisfying ,graphics are cool and the music ,oh god ,the music is really good . The nordic and celtic vibes in the combat music boils your blood with intense feelings . I 'd say even full price is totally worth it .

While the game gives you a lot of weapons one would generally just use a sniper and then a smg for desperate times . For pistols I 'm betting most people use a silenced pistol . Because going loud isn 't all that ideal . Shotguns seems to be really weak though which is a shame . Played coop through the entire game and it was fun . But if you do not like sniper rifle games this is not for you .

404,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FreeIceCreamKiddos/recommended/271590,FreeIceCreamKiddos,271590,Pretty fun game , I have almost 600 hours on it and I 'll probably have much more over time . However I wouldn 't recommend this game because of how much it pushes for you to buy Shark Cards in Online , over priced microtransactions that provide you with in-game currency . This wouldn 't be a problem if you didn 't mind constantly , and I mean CONSTANTLY grinding to buy the things you can use in freemode . Hell , you have to grind just to buy things you use to grind even more . At one point I caved in and bought a shark card because grinding in this game is awful and I just wanted to get this one vehicle . I wouldn 't make that mistake again because it only further encourages Rockstar to add microtransactions to future games . Story mode doesn 't have that great of a story and you can 't do much , so if that 's what you want I 'd buy IV , San Andreas or Vice City instead . Also if you 're wondering what grinding entails , it means doing the same heists over and over (they get boring after playing through them a few times ), doing missions and races that pay {?} and doing freemode missions for your business , MC or soon enough nightclub that pay pretty well but are so horribly boring and leave you at the mercy of griefers .

GOD dammit do not just rush in because you are a melee guy standing in between two enemies {?} ing railing you . When in combat , you should almost always be backing up after landing a blow or a series of blows . It 's a dance , not a run in and stand there and get rekt . 2. Movement abilities are not for DODGING single attacks , unless they are ultimates , roots , stuns , or you 'd die otherwise . They are for fixing your {?} when you fail to maintain control of RULE #1. This game is 75% spatial awareness and movement . 3. Retreat TOWARDs your allies , why is this so difficult to grasp ? If you 're getting 2v1 'd why the hell would you use your only movement ability to move AWAY from me and into a corner where you will immediatey be trapped again 2v1 ? 4.

It 's a really fun game , but super frustrating to say the least . Its basically Child Abuse-The Game , as you play a little boy who is running from his mother . The characters offer wide variety of strengths and weaknesses which make the game even more frustrating / fun . I don 't have really any complaints for the game , other than the repeativeness of the way you die can be pretty annoying , and getting really far in a run only to die during the last few minutes of the run . I don 't have any of the DLC yet , but I 'd highly reccommend this game to anyone looking for a new , fun , addicting game to add to their library .

Now with this 'free' tag and the discount I took the chance to check the game out further and maybe buy it as well . One of the things I was interested in was the editor with workshop support . I have checked the editor out and it is pretty oldschool and not user friendly . It is basically like the MoW editor that starts with just a black screen and no terrain . That terrain can not simply be created in the editor , you need to import (as it seems ) hightmaps before you can actually do anything in the editor . I checked out the community hub for decent guides for the editor and there weren 't many , nothing that could help me getting started anyway . So the editor is probably not something for me and I won 't be using it . Then I checked the game out and found out that this 'free' is actually only the online portion of the game ... while I am only interested in single player . Too bad I can 't check out SP mode and play at least 1 skirmish map against AI . Now I still don 't know how good / bad the AI is in the game . I also noticed that this game has an ingame store where you can buy lootboxes and stuff ... which feels more like a f2p concept to me rather than a payed game . Anywho , the decent presentation from the store page was better than my impression in the game itself the short time I have tried it out . I am scrapping it from the wishlist , because there is too much I have seen that I didn 't like . Nice concept of playing a strategy game from 1st person perspective and traditional 3rd person perspective , but the execution needs to be right also . Don 't take this thumb down review as a 'this game sucks ', I am just not recommending it based on what I have encountered in the game . Maybe the single player portion of the game will actually be decent , but I am not going to take that gamble based on the other things I have seen in the game .

This gets to the extent that the description of this game is a borderline lie . Pros : - Great art , good sound and solid writing that creates atmosphere and tension . Cons : - The whole game is less than 2 hours . I doubled back to make sure I didn 't miss anything . With strictly linear gameplay it baffles me that anyone has over 3-4 hours on this . - The train is basically a minigame , with next to no consiquence . There are subsystems that you manage , but you will never do more than one per station . - The story builds and builds and builds with zero pay off . - An extremely unsatisfying ending . - An extremely token weapon upgrade system that makes little to no difference . - Constant references to a better train , never happens . - The game has a survival mechanic for passengers , but not only do you NOT need to pick any up , their survival is based on either you do or do not have food . - Crafting is borderline meaningless as all you craft is pistol ammo , shotgun ammo , or medkit . All of which you get plenty of in levels . - While the story does go through great efforts to build tension , and while effective , it does nothing with it .

When I saw it on Steam yesterday , I went and bought it without a second thought , since it is such a great game to this day and it is really difficult but that 's what 's keeping me playing it and it may be fairly old and fairly inexpensive but it is a great game to play and it wastes a lot of your time because it is so addicting . If you do not have a powerful PC , don 't worry because this game can run on almost every device , so your laptop / PC is bound to run it . If you have some money in your wallet or a few loose coins somewhere and you don 't know what to spend it on , I would suggest you buy this game since it is well worth your money , and even if you complete the game there are still more challenges on each level , so you can never not do something . I 've only played it for over an hour on Steam but I 'm sure there are many more hours to come ! Great game .

It 's a shame , really , since the presentation style is quite striking and the whole thing is originally put together . Unfortunately , I found it to be just plain , old , grindingly dull .

431,1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041528015/recommended/416380,76561198041528015,416380,This is , hands down , one of my favorite bullet hell games so far ! The player can choose between 4 ships with different shot patterns and stats . There are also 2 unlockable ships that seem to have the same stats as existing ships . The ship controls in this vertical shoot 'em up are highly responsive , with a Touhou-style focus / slow button that allows for precise movement . Aside from the main shot , there are secondary weapons that can be useful in certain situations , and the Baryon Laser , which is explained below . The main gameplay can be summed up as following : - shoot enemies to fill up the Baryon Laser gauge - when the gauge is full , activate the Baryon Laser - this turns enemies and bullets into items that fill the Grabuster gauge when collected - after some time , you enter Grabuster mode , which lasts until the gauge depletes In Grabuster mode (or Gravastar , the translation is inconsistent ), the ship is surrounded by what looks like a small black hole , and turns into a weapon that can be moved quickly across the screen , while damaging everything it touches . The above cycle is tied into the score system , and you can maximize your score by planning when to activate the Baryon Laser , when to pick up items that fill those gauges , and by prioritizing certain targets over others in Grabuster mode (-> increase the multiplier before destroying larger enemies that are worth more points ). Getting hit activates a shield for a few seconds , and prevents you from losing a life at the cost of some Baryon Laser energy , if you have enough . However , this is risky and worse than using the gauge for the Baryon Laser , so it 's more of a safeguard with a major drawback . The patterns in this game are very basic , consisting of aimed and static shots / bullet clusters , which sometimes rotate or expand slightly . So it 's less about memorizing fancy bullet patterns , and more about navigating quickly through static bullet patterns while avoiding or guiding aimed shots , and trying not to get cornered by dense bullet curtains . The colorful bullets can be easily distinguished from the background , with some rare exceptions . To make things more interesting , the game encourages horizontal movement by making the stage slightly wider than the play area , and with visible or hidden ground targets that provide items or collectibles . The bosses are basically floating platforms with a main core , and attack turrets as optional targets . While the bosses themselves aren 't very unique , the fights are somewhat interesting because the player has the option to either play it safe , or destroy all turrets , which will spawn sets of stronger turrets , and allows for a higher score . With 12 stages , the game is quite long for an arcade shoot 'em up , and there 's an entire second loop with more difficult stage variants in Arcade mode , while Story mode offers plenty of dialog , and some lengthy unlockable endings . The story centers on a squad of 4 pilots , who have to face a fearful enemy , and deal with a conspiracy , which is complicated by the role and background of each pilot , and by some outsiders that become involved later . There are some anime cliches , along with US / Hollywood cliches , and some explicit language , reminding me a bit of Black Lagoon . ;) I generally liked the story , especially for setting the mood or making me care about the characters , though sometimes it was a bit hard to follow (mediocre translation / alternate drawing style in endings ), silly , or overly dramatic . Apart from Story and Arcade mode , there 's also a practice and a caravan mode . If that 's not enough , a DLC with 4 additional stages / 2 loops and another story mode can be purchased . What makes this game great IMO is the unique gameplay which ... just feels right as a whole , just like the gameplay in Eschatos , Crimzon Clover , Trouble Witches or Murasaki . It 's hard to explain , so I 'd recommend to just try the demo . ;) In addition , I 'm completely addicted to the soundtrack , which was the reason why I bought the game in the first place . :) However , the game has some considerable flaws : - no graphic settings besides window / fullscreen (only 1280x720 ) - either vsync with noticable input delay , or no vsync with noticable screen tearing , no in-game vsync option - w / o vsync , game may set the framerate to the monitor refresh rate (e.g. can run at 144 instead of 60 fps ) - mediocre English translation - small main game area in case of non-widescreen monitor - in rare cases , the game freezes for a moment - no replays - 8 achievements seem to be unobtainable (?) - the Start button on a gamepad cannot be remapped While many of those should be fixed , it doesn 't affect my experience too much : Window mode works for me , I don 't mind the screen tearing or changing the monitor refresh rate , I 'm usually not able to get all achievements in a bullet hell game anyway , and the freezes are rare and hardly affect gameplay . What bothers me most is that the main game occupies only a small area of my non-widescreen monitor , but it 's still highly playable thanks to the excellent bullet visibility , except for higher difficulty levels where it can become a pain . It 's also noteworthy that the game has unlimited continues , and using a continue does not reset the score . There 's a reward for avoiding death , but there doesn 't seem to be a strong penalty for dying a lot compared to dying once during a boss fight , and I wouldn 't be surprised if this could be slightly exploited . I 'm not an expert , though , and I don 't know how much potential for a boring exploit there is . If this bothers someone , there 's at least the option to refuse to continue , and ignore scores that don 't have a zero at the end .

434,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/399810,maudish,399810,Review copy provided by publisher Lovecraft is more than just a troubled genre writer now , he 's essentially become a genre unto himself . Stories , films , and games have all taken countless attempts at bringing his visions of cosmic , unknowable horror to life , with varying degrees of success . Some of the best adaptations of his work borrow the themes and tones and apply them to a new mythos , such as with The Last Door and Darkest Dungeon . But other attempts pull directly from that dark well , and that 's where you 'll find Call of Cthulhu , clinging to the line . Despite taking the source and running with it , this title unfortunately runs straight into the ground with technical issues , nonsensical writing , and a serious problem with pacing . Edward Pierce is living the low life as a private investigator , following his harrowing stint in World War I . He spends more time examining the bottoms of bottles , at least until a strange case lands on his doorstep in the form of a painting . Sarah Hawkins , a brilliant and eccentric painter , has died in a fire along with her husband and son under curious circumstances . To get at the truth of her passing , Pierce will travel to the remote island of Darkwater , a comically-appropriate name for the grim little fishing village rife with unspeakable secrets . With a sharp eye and a silver tongue , there 's a chance Pierce can piece together this mystery , but even if he does the cost may prove too great for him . Call of Cthulhu is a first-person adventure game , focused on investigation and dialog instead of exploration or combat . After the opening scenes in your office you 'll find yourself in the sickly harbor of Darkwater , surrounded by seedy characters to chat with and carelessly-discarded notes to read . Much of your time in the game will be spent talking with NPCs , grilling them on their experiences and pressing them on their stories . This is facilitated by a light RPG system where you assign points to five skills including investigation , psychology , and strength to unlock new options both in dialog and in solving puzzles . Facts learned from the inhabitants of the island will be essential for your progression and also for making sense of the dark machinations in motion there . This is also where you 'll notice the first cracks in this promising package . I can 't quite put my finger on what exactly it is , but every single character in the game looks off . This isn 't subtle fish-person syndrome either , this is a failure of the artists to produce convincing-looking humans . Everyone is stiff and waxen , with dead eyes and exaggerated hand gestures to distract you from those seriously dead eyes . Animations often jerk and blink around , and anything meant to be affected by physics like long hair or dresses is going to spazz out at least once . The rest of the game looks pretty good , if a little too green , but the characters being such a major feature makes their failings all the more noticeable . And then there 's the dialog . Adventure games live and die on solid writing , and I don 't know if it was localization troubles or what but the dialog here is downright laughable . Again , it 's not off-putting on purpose , it 's simply written with no regard for actual human expressions or reason . Your boy Pierce snaps at people who 've said nothing objectionable , assaults a man and then buys him a beer without suffering any consequences , and snatches an axe from a threatening fellow only to immediately return it . NPCs are impossible to get a read on , as they might hate you at the start of a dialog and then offer you anything you want by the end . The voice actors seem to be trying here , but with lines that so frequently contradict each other in terms of tone there 's only so much they can do . When you 're not conversing with unconvincing mannequins of people , you 'll be investigating grim locales and skirting past foes . The former there is decent enough , giving you detailed rooms to comb and simple reconstruction scenes where you just click on the pertinent parts of a room to recall what happened there . You 'll also turn up plenty of supplementary notes and items , sometimes offering alternate solutions to progression barriers . The latter , however , comes in the form of stealth sections that ultimately killed the game for me . Stealth in a cosmic horror game is a natural fit but your first bout with it is outwitting dopey guards to escape an asylum , a far cry from the thrill of eluding eldritch terrors . You do actually get to do that in the second sequence , but it 's in a cramped gallery with an uninspiring monster , and you 're reduced to trial-and-error because you can 't outrun the thing , it can find you if you look at it , and it likes to bug out around the convenient hiding cabinets . Overall , I get the impression that the developers just weren 't up to the challenge of seeing this vision through . Call of Cthulhu is a fine foundation for a cosmic horror game , but nearly every part of the execution falls short . The characters are stiff and off-putting in their speech , the stealth ends up being more of a pain than anything , and the pacing is all off . There was one great scare early on that showed a real mastery of timing and expectations , but that was it . You 'll get one good scare per chapter , if that , and everything in between threatens to bore or frustrate you away . Someday I hope to see a truly great game built on the Lovecraft mythos , but if this is where we 're at then I think I 'll be waiting quite some time . Did you enjoy this review ? I certainly hope so , and I certainly hope you 'll check out more of them at <url> or on my curation page !

The puzzle-elements are reminiscient of old Zelda games . For the old school gamers , this game will have the most resemblance to Legend of Zelda : Four Swords Adventure on the game boy . The only flaw is that the game is a bit on the short side and it will only have replayability if you can get at least one friend to play it with you on repeat sessions . It 's ok as a single-player game , but it 's not recommended . The challenge and enjoyment comes from cooperating and working with your partners , as you each can only perform one task-oriented superpower .
436,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sengtsan/recommended/43110,sengtsan,43110,Enjoyable FPS with great atmosphere , graphics , sound and story . Only complaint is the controls are a bit clunky and hardware demands vs . the actual performance seem somewhat excessive ; optimisation not that great . I love that the storytelling sensibility is so distinctly rooted in russian culture ; it makes the game quite unique and interesting in a way a lot of FPS from the west are not . Dour , dark , depressive and moody in an unforced , authentic way . Definitely worth the c . 15 hours it takes to complete the campaign .

It has simple and understandable gameplay that doesn 't deserve high praise , but praise none the less . The music in this game is absolutly incredible . They used facial scanning technology to record real actors faces and put it into the game (Google " LA Noire - Tech Trailer " ). My only complaint is that the ending hits you in the gut and not in the best way . Other than that , this game will forever be in my book as a classic . 9.4/10

Instead of the school life you are instead brought on a tropical island with some new faces to go along with it , you think everything is at peace with Monimi but then later Monokuma shows up to spoil the fun and the killing game begins . Like the first game you are giving time to hang out with the other students on the island and give them gifts to know more about them and this is something I am glad that this game improved on and that is the gift giving . In the first game you had to give certain gifts to know more about each and ever charcter in the game and that made you try and test your luck to find it then you had to use a guide to find that certain gift and of course keep checking to see if you had that gift and that sucked , but in this game if you can 't find that one certain gift in the game if you have any water or sun flower seeds on you they will accpect it and that is a good impovment . The class trails are also improved as well and when it 's the final debt all they give you is a set of 5 images and once you get 3 or 4 correct you move on to the next set , I hated this at first but I started to like it cause now I don 't have to get all confused witth everything . All in all Danganronpa 2 Goodbye Despair is a great sequal and a improvment to the first game and I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the first one and likes visual novels . Oh and Chika is 10/10 wafiu .
441,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mallowy/recommended/369340,Mallowy,369340,Great soundtrack , but delivered in a less-than-perfect way . The music itself is pretty great , as I would hope from a story about demons who live off of rock and roll , though it 's a lot less " heavy rock " than I expected . Instead what you get is chill guitars , smooth ambient tracks , a tiny bit of electronic , and a dash of energetic high-tempo stuff to spice up fights and other high-tension scenes . Overall I was pleasantly surprised by the audio in the game and highly recommend a listen . Part of me got very excited when I first heard " Shop Rock Holic " , the song that plays in the mall scenes , as it reminded me of a slower version of " Your Sunset " , the customization theme from Tekken Tag 2 , which I 've listened to for hours on end . Anyway , unfortunately there 's some small issues with the handling of the music files that may be annoying for some people . They are as such : The Soundtrack DLC installs to the Reject Demon Toko game folder as loose files instead of a folder , making things a bit messy and hard to find or understand . All the files are .OGGs, which is a filetype that may not be recognized by all music players , and may need to be manually converted to .MP3 or such by the user before being compatible with a device (Tip: Foobar2000 with the LAME plugin can easily convert music filetypes if you need it , as can a lot of open-source music players programs , you just gotta look around a bit ). While the files are tagged mostly correctly , having album art , musician , album name , and year all correctly tagged , none of the songs list their track number , meaning you either have to have them all out of order or manually tag them yourself (Tip: Again , this is easy with Foobar2000 or other similar music programs . Also , the correct order is listed on the DLC storepage ). The songs themselves are all loops , and a few of them end a little oddly when you 're not listening to them on repeat , but it sounds mostly fine in my opinion . There might be a bit of variance between the volume of some songs , making some more quiet than others , but I 'm not 100% sure on that . Additionally , for Audiophiles : The tracks seem to be encoded lossy , and range between 140 and 173 kbps . I have no idea how much this matters for I am but a humble audio normie , don 't look at me . All in all I 'm glad I decided to buy the Soundtrack with the game , even if I had to put in a little work to get everything set up right . The music is so chill and relaxing that at least half of my playtime is from accidentally letting the game run while getting distracted by Twitter and the calming ambience of the game 's music . As far as the small issues with the handling of the files go , they 're all easy fixes so hopefully the devs will put in some time at some point to correct things a bit . The OST runs for 28 minutes , and includes 13 tracks ranging from 1 :33 to 3 :14 in length . PS : I wrote this entirely while listening to the OST , it 's good ok

444,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fathobbit/recommended/688550,fathobbit,688550,I got this game with a Steam coupon , so it cost 10c . Overall in time sitting in front of the computer it took probably about 1.5 hrs to finish including all the achievements . Fun little game that does what it says , jump a ball through maze . Levels get harder as you go and the difficulty ramps up nicely . There are no impossible spots to get through . As some others have said , the controls can be a pain (definately suggest a controller for this ), and your ball won 't stop quick enough sometimes , and in others , will stop too quick and fly back the other way . You also keep your momentum from your " deaths " at the start of the next attempt , so the first few seconds are usually you steadying your ball at the start before making the next attempt . There are also some spots where the camera is behind bigger obstacles and you can 't actually see your ball . All in all definately worth a play if you want to kill an hour or two and can see past the smaller " bugs " , especially for the price .

The Story Is something i wont forget , Its amazing the first 4 hours , then ... you loose intrest and have to force yourself to finish the game . The Gameplay ... (Jesus Christ ) Its Old , it fells old , and its either really easy or just unfair , for example : your suppose to find a shovel , you look everywhere forever trying to find this shovel , you give up , look on a walktrough and see that its behind some trashcans , only thing is ...THE SHOVEL IS NOT VISIBLE BEHIND THE TRASHCANS , AND you cant just click on the trashcans , but slightley above them ... christ , you cant look for something if said item is invincible . but other than items not being visible , the gameplay is just extremley boring 90% of the time . Rating : 5/10 I Had fun playing this game (only for the excellent story ), but im never touching this game again , keep in mind that i have no nostalgia for this game , so the rating is " raw " . Do i recommend it , NOPE ! Why ? Its Extremley Old , the gameplay feels Old (in a bad way ), nuff said .

450,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/925930,stumpo,925930,I write this review for people who have already played Myst and Riven and want to know whether to continue playing the series . If you have not played these two games , I suggest you begin with RealMyst Masterpiece Edition and go on from there (maybe buy the Cyan Complete Pack if they update that to include Myst 3 and 4. ). I have light spoilers recapping elements from the first two games below . For everyone else , I think a good review of this game should answer two questions for you : 1 ) Is this game worth playing if you 're a fan of the series ? 2 ) Is the port / release of the game good ? (The answers to those questions below the break ) To the first question , yes , I believe Myst 3 is worth playing if you 're a fan of the series . I grew up playing Myst and Riven and had dabbled with Myst 3 : Exile in the past , but never completed it . On the whole I think this is an inspired spiritual sequel to Myst and Riven . I say spiritual sequel because besides the obvious difference that the game was not developed by Cyan Worlds , the plot takes place in a sort of between-space where events and characters from Myst / Riven are mentioned but in general all the events of this game have no real bearing on Myst 4 or 5. The game involves a character called Saavedro , trapped by Sirrus and Achenar , the villains of Myst , in the age of J 'nanin (also the game 's hub world ). This character manages to escape and steals an important linking book from Atrus . The game consists of a hub world , three ages , and a final puzzle which takes place in a self-contained age . The game 's strength is that like Myst and Riven it has exceptionally good visual design (I have posted a few dozen screenshots if you want to check ) and solid , challenging but not impossible puzzles . If there 's a weakness , it 's that to me the three main puzzle ages do not feel like cohesive world , written so that characters could visit or live in them . There is a plot reason for this : the ages were written by Atrus as " tutorials " to explain how to build a world to his sons . But this gives them a sort of weird , artificial quality where it is unclear why they are assembled the way they are or what a visitor might hope to get from them . Something I love about Myst and Riven is how the puzzles feel organic and integrated into the world , but the world still feels livable , and I didn 't find that here . The game 's final climax makes use of a puzzle that I found interesting . It is easy but fun if you understand what makes it tick , but maddening if you don 't make the logical leap to figure out how it works . As with every Myst game , take notes , read the journals you find , and listen to the voice acting . It is easy to miss things . I took around 7 pages of notes . Although I hadn 't taken notes that were used specifically in the final puzzle , my memory of certain clues found earlier did prompt me to understand the puzzle . I may have benefitted from playing the game in 3-4 marathon sessions over a few day period . I remembered virtually nothing from the game from my previous attempt to play it 15 years ago , and the 7.4 hours it took me is the amount of time it took to finish the game and view the alternate " bad " endings . In general , I would say this game is less difficult than Myst and Riven , but not necessarily easy . I want to make special note of the game 's score . The first two games , scored by Robyn Miller , used ambient , natural music . Here , Jack Wall does soaring and often eastern-sounding score . It 's a different approach . I like Miller 's version more , but Wall is still a very talented composer . In terms of whether this is a good port -- it is a good but bare bones port . The game works on my computer without a hitch . Everything visually looked good and not stretched or janky . There is obviously some clash between the FMVs and the pre-rendered backgrounds , but in general I thought everything looked great . Navigation was quick and easy , and I didn 't run into any timing issues that sometimes plague running old games on modern machines . Cyan worked with the crew at ResidualVM (a 3d spinoff of ScummVM ) to make sure the ResidualVM engine fully supports the game 's content . There are at the time of my writing no achievements , trading cards , or support for anything fancy , and the visuals definitely showed some age . But I don 't think this should discourage anyone from buying the port . As with any Myst game , good luck solving the puzzles and please try to resist the modern urge to immediately seek a hint . Walk around , play with objects you find , take a break , come back to the game , and if you find you get to the end , you 'll feel tremendously satisfied about the breakthroughs you 've made . I am really happy to see the entire Myst series under Cyan Worlds ' ownership and published on Steam for people to play . I had a great time playing the game , and although it did not make as strong of an impression as Myst and Riven did , I 'm confident that if you liked those two games , you 'll like this one . I offer an enthusiastic recommendation and I hope that you enjoy the game .
451,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/papasmurf645/recommended/552500,papasmurf645,552500,Great game with satisfying gameplay and fun team mechanics , but I 'm hoping some improvements will be made as time goes on . For example , my very first game a rat ogre got stuck on a high rooftop , right at the end of the level , leading us to begrudgingly end the match and start over , scrapping 15 minutes of gameplay . Not a good first impression at a given , but I gave it another go and had a blast with the next team I paired with and completed the level with no issues . Everytime I do have a crappy game it has to do with these boss monsters , depending on where you are on the map they can make or break your entire game , you 'll be having a great match , you 'll have collected all the grimoires and tomes and were working well as a team only for a giant tentacle flesh monster to come barreling at you , knock you into a corner and just wail on all of you (as I said , it all depends on where you are . In an open-ish where you can all navigate around it it 's fine and pretty exciting , many times we 've killed the thing in a couple minutes flat . But I 've had them jump me in the middle of a raid where all the players have been pushed away from eachother by mobs , only for a boss to come in and F us over at the end of the match . Or a boss will charge at us in a tight corridor , pinning us to walls . Other times you just have total noobs who can 't make the decison whether to run and let the thing follow you to a better spot or try to battle it in a dumb corridor , leading the whole group to go on a suicide pact .) You can feel real jipped by this sometimes . Another complaint is that it can feel a little grindy if you keep getting paired with crappy teams and are constantly losing , you won 't be getting any good weapons for quite a while , combat while very satisfying may feel kinda floaty at first (you come to find how important timing , blocking , pushing , general crowd control tactics , and headshots are though after a few games .) and the abilities kinda get less useful as the difficulty ups (only played kruber so far actually , so I can only attest to him though .) Another big issue is host migration . Where if the host of your match leaves then you have to restart an entire match over , and you lose all the exp you would 've gotten otherwise , can be incredibly frustrating . However , these complaints are overshadowed by the satisfying combat , lovely warhammer world , and the feeling of accomplishment you feel after wading through hundreds of Skaven and chaos warriors . The joy of landing a nice cleave , where you cut the heads off 3 ratmen at once is just special . You can easily F yourself over if you lose concentration , the mobs come fast when they come and in great numbers , having a good team behind you , covering all the angles is super important , especially once you get out of recruit . So overall , get it . Once you get through the initial grind you 'll find a nice alternative to the L4D formula with the melee emphasis and fantasy setting . Though expect a few humps and bouts of frustration as you will get overwhelmed at some points and it doesn 't always feel fair .

Jumpix Jump is filled with assets bought from the Unity store . The character file for this 'protagonist' is even an asset from the Unity store itself . The graphics are terrible and aren 't even close to looking good . The controls are very buggy and the character even glitches when you jump on a platform . The soundtrack is not even close to being creative since every single song in this game is royalty-free music . The design for all of the levels in this game look like it was put together by a 3 year old . There isn 't even any NPCs in this game , nor any enemies in sight .

Pros : Great artstyle , amazing music , sparkling humour and well thought-out plot with memorable characters . Cons : By acquiring this game you 're losing your soul . Plus some players get overly obsessed with the game and try always bringing it up , converting everyone they talk to into playing it , etc ... But hey ! Every healthy community has those weirdos ! Detailed , without spoilers Oh boy , here we go . To me it feels like everyone has heard about this game by now , but if you haven 't - oh are you in luck , because this game truly is one of a kind gem that shines even brighter when played blind ! Undertale is a singleplayer RPG that remembers your actions . The artstyle is neat , deliberately simplistic and sometimes really cute . Reminds of good old early gaming era RPGs . The game mechanics are rather simple and will be familiar to those oldschool RPG lovers . The main difference between this game and other RPGs is that you don 't -have- to kill every monster you meet . Taking even this one simple notion into account , your entire playstyle may change drastically , leading you to different mid-game changes , and , of course , endings . The music in Undertale combines 8bit and instrumental parts , is very well written , and greatly compliments the art and the story , making it into a whole brilliant work . Overall being a simple game , Undertale refers to older RPG games and up-to-date media , has its own unique traits and manages to touch on complex matters , making not the pixels you control , but you , the player himself , an active and responsible for his doings figure . Detailed , with spoilers As someone who 's determinately beaten the game three times and watched several playthroughs on top of that , I feel competent enough to write this review . There are three general routes you can take in Undertale , and every one of them is worth going for . The neutral ending will make you WTF hard , the pacifist ending will make you really happy and possibly force you to shed a tear , and the genocide route will bring your self-esteem down to 0 , then stomp on your heart and take your very soul for good measure . So , I 've got a question for you . What other computer games out there are able to do all this and more to you in a matter of several hours ? The answer is - not too many of them , which makes Undertale such a treasure , my personal GOTY-2015 and a must-have for every modern player . Alright , here 's a better question . Do you read the review just to get more opinions on this amazing game after having beaten it yourself to fill in that gaping void in your heart ? Yes ? I knew it . 10/10 , would have a bad time again .

The music is not bad either . Those positive things said , this game does not feel good to me . As you do not see any moving sprites , it is naturally very much focussed on text and numbers , which means reading all the time (of course without voice acting ). The omnipresence of stat numbers makes the combat and world exploration quite abstract and static . As this kind of technology cannot possibly win you over on a visual level , the writing could have been the means to create some kind of atmosphere . Unfortunately , the creators missed this opportunity , making an attempt on a weird surrealistic humour that did not make me laugh once (Pony Island was much cleverer in my opinion ). Even worse , it destroys the immersion again and again , and you should not do that in an RPG unless you are really talented in writing self-ironic and fourth-wall-breaking scripts . It is interesting to try out new and old concepts as alternatives to the modern mainstream , but there is a reason why ASCII-interfaces are not used anymore . Sorry - 3/10 from me .
469,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hymntothesea/recommended/750920,hymntothesea,750920,TL :DR if you expect a lot of combat from this game , do not buy it . If you want decent puzzles , stealth based action scenes or you are a Tomb Raider fan -old or new- in general , go for it . Shadow of the Tomb Raider is not a perfect game , it has its flaws -to some A LOT of them- but I believe it depends on what you expect from this game . As an old Tomb Raider fan , I expected puzzles that were not solvable in the very first minute , a strong Lara depiction and a little bit of action to add some spice to the game . I got what I wanted , but certainly there are some features I thought that could 've been a lot better . - Skill system is pretty much useless in this game . If you played the previous games , you will recognize most of the skills that are present in Shadow . Those skills worked fine in 2013 and Rise because there were a lot of combat moments in them , but in Shadow there aren 't a lot of combat . So weapon crafting and upgrading is pretty useless as well . Sometimes you won 't even have your weapons other than your bow to fight the enemies anyway , sometimes you are forced to kill enemies only with your knife . -The game had many ads saying that you were going to be in the Amazon jungle this time , dealing with predators and wild life , but there aren 't a lot of moments like that either . Only a few jaguars , piranhas and eels and that 's pretty much the wild life you 're going to witness . I expected more since Amazon was called the Green Hell by the conquistadors . - It 's a bit shorter than the previous games . The story is decent , it 's not mind blowing nor lame . There are some moments you can see them coming from a mile away , but I thought it was interesting to deal with Trinity once again . Although I feel Lara has not become THE Lara we know , it 's still nice to see her questioning her environment -even if she destroys or takes most of the artifacts she finds in her raidings lol - If you like parkouring , then you will love this game . Especially with the new difficulty settings , you can set the exploration difficulty on whatever suits you . - More swimming . I think this lacked in the previous games , so it was nice to have some underwater areas you can explore , be careful with the piranhas though . - There are more crypts and optional tombs in Shadow , and some of them are GREAT . Most of them have great atmosphere where you truly feel you are in a place that has been hidden and no man has set foot on the ground for a very long time . - I 'm not even mentioning the graphics , the game looks pretty neat . It needs a bit more optimization as of October 2nd , but still it 's a feast for the eyes . - This may not be important to many , but when I play games that are based on historical facts , then I want them to be researched thoroughly so they will be accurate . Sadly that is not the case here , you are going to see a lot of Mayan symbols in Incan tombs . The story tries to fix this mistake , but it 's not doing a very believable job . Even the artifacts you find here and there , they have wrong information written about them . You can say " this is a game , not a history lesson " and that 's fair ^_^ I just think if you are giving information about a REAL historical object , then at least do it right . Overall , this is an enjoyable game but I would recommend you to wait for a discount .

471,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/YamaKasin/recommended/285900,YamaKasin,285900,The best local co-op party game on Steam , hands down . Add a couch + some friends + some beers and let yourself be instantly swept off your feet and carried away to the land of headbutts , falling unconscious bodies , bizarre physics and tons of laughter . The sheer amount of fun you can have with this simple and wacky game is just amazing . The rounds are quick and the game is easy to pick up which makes it an ideal party game , for every kind of gamer out there . I know many people are waiting for an online update , and so was I . Until I took part in a local 4-player brawl during an evening party game session . I don 't think that any online update will be able to top the fun that can be drawn from playing with someone sitting next to you , laughing together . The strenght of this game lies in its social fun factor , and nothing can beat sitting together in a cosy room , sipping on a beer and ordering a pizza together , while throwing each other into the incinerator or right under the oncoming subway .

The idea of Dungeon Keeper series , which this game continues , can be seen in the store page for this game . Instead of leading your hero through a dungeon , defeating monsters , here the roles are reversed - you are planning out a dungeon , training and commanding monsters to fight invading heroes , meeting the various needs of your monsters in the process . All of this is accompanied by appropriately dark humorous lines from The Mentor (the same voice actor that narrated the original , Richard Ridings ): <url> I 'm sure there will be those who don 't see the appeal of this concept . If you are one of those people , this game isn 't for you . But if you loved Dungeon Keeper & Dungeon Keeper 2 , you will love this game as well . I 've read some reviews here and seen TB 's reviews on YouTube , and I must say that many parts of the game which were apparently not done at the time have been completed . The game is very playable and I don 't have any complaints so far . The price is a bit overblown , bit such is the case with all " bigger " (well known / anticipated ) games during the first year or so . My advice is to get it with a discount if you can .
473,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/boostmetal/recommended/236090,boostmetal,236090,The animation is largely superb , barring that of the town NPCs , who appear very clearly to have their limbs rigged to a skeleton instead of uniquely animated . The music , too , is quite nice and fits the atmosphere well with its various piano arrangements , but Dust : an Elysian Tale 's combat is where the game truly shines . Said combat is combo-heavy , both when grounded and mid-air , and bears a strong resemblance to what can be found in Capcom 's Devil May Cry series , albeit on a 2D plane . There is also a strong metroidvania element , but without a dense , labyrinthine structure to get frustratingly lost within , and I found the voice acting to be satisfying from all performers , especially Kimlinh Tran (who is perhaps more well-known for her work as Ms . Fortune in Skullgirls ). I won 't spoil the story here , though it isn 't particularly complex , but I will say that I was applauding as the credits rolled . Dust : an Elysian Tale is truly one of my favorite titles on Steam , and is likely well worth your time .
474,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/heybabyxxx/recommended/208730,heybabyxxx,208730,This game reminded me of the first " Watch Dogs " : besides having flaws and all the bad reviews it received at launch (it was released after " The Witcher 2 " , a very superior action RPG , came around ), I had lots of fun playing it . Specially because of the story , starred by 2 new characters , Mors and Alester ; as fitting with the original books , the plot is very bleak , violent and tragic , so don 't expect a happy ending . My playthrough took about 40 hours ; it felt like a big game and I think the current price is fair . The combat system , although it reminds me a bit of Final Fantasy XII , is not very exciting : fights are automatic and you just line up commands in slow motion , managing above all your energy . Some fights can be very tough and the best strategy I found was to keep enemies on the ground , interrupting their special moves . Getting the best (and very expensive ) weapons and armour is the way to keep the difficulty at bay . In terms of gameplay , the most interesting sections are when you play stealthily with Mors 's dog . Fans of the books or the TV show may be disappointed because most of the well known characters don 't make an appearance . Keep in mind that this is a Game of Thrones game , not THE Game of Thrones game . This universe deserves an even more ambitious RPG .

You must AVERAGE a perfect 3 out of 3 stars on normal difficulty , AND a near perfect 2 out of 3 stars on HARD difficulty on each level to continue to the next level ... I really did like the game ... right up until levels wouldn 't unlock until I played the previous levels again and played them perfectly ...

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Hi my name is Ebony Dark 'ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair (that's how I got my name ) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don 't know who she is get da hell out of here !). I 'm not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he 's a major {?} ing hottie . I 'm a vampire but my teeth are straight and white . I have pale white skin . I 'm also a witch , and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I 'm in the seventh year (I'm seventeen ). I 'm a goth (in case you couldn 't tell ) and I wear mostly black . I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there . For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt , pink fishnets and black combat boots . I was wearing black lipstick , white foundation , black eyeliner and red eye shadow . I was walking outside Hogwarts . It was snowing and raining so there was no sun , which I was very happy about . A lot of preps stared at me . I put up my middle finger at them . ¡°Hey Ebony !¡± shouted a voice . I looked up . It was ¡­. Draco Malfoy ! ¡°What's up Draco ?¡± I asked . ¡°Nothing.¡± he said shyly . But then , I heard my friends call me and I had to go away .

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX666XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX The next day I woke up in my bedroom . It was snowing and raining again . I opened the door of my coffin and drank some blood from a bottle I had . My coffin was black ebony and inside it was hot pink velvet with black lace on the ends . I got out of my coffin and took of my giant MCR t-shirt which I used for pajamas . Instead , I put on a black leather dress , a pentagram necklace , combat boots and black fishnets on . I put on four pairs of earrings in my pierced ears , and put my hair in a kind of messy bun . My friend , Willow (AN: Raven dis is u !) woke up then and grinned at me . She flipped her long waist-length raven black hair with pink streaks and opened her forest-green eyes . She put on her Marilyn Manson t-shirt with a black mini , fishnets and pointy high-heeled boots . We put on our makeup (black lipstick white foundation and black eyeliner .) ¡°OMFG, I saw you talking to Draco Malfoy yesterday !¡± she said excitedly . ¡°Yeah? So ?¡± I said , blushing . ¡°Do you like Draco ?¡± she asked as we went out of the Slytherin common room and into the Great Hall . ¡°No I so {?} ing don 't!¡± I shouted . ¡°Yeah right !¡± she exclaimed .

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX On the night of the concert I put on my black lace-up boots with high heels . Underneath them were ripped red fishnets . Then I put on a black leather minidress with all this corset stuff on the back and front . I put on matching fishnet on my arms . I straightened my hair and made it look all spiky . I felt a little depressed then , so I slit one of my wrists . I read a depressing book while I waited for it to stop bleeding and I listened to some GC . I painted my nails black and put on TONS of black eyeliner . Then I put on some black lipstick . I didn 't put on foundation because I was pale anyway . I drank some human blood so I was ready to go to the concert . I went outside . Draco was waiting there in front of his flying car . He was wearing a Simple Plan t-shirt (they would play at the show too ), baggy black skater pants , black nail polish and a little eyeliner (AN: A lot fo kewl boiz wer it ok !). ¡°Hi Draco !¡± I said in a depressed voice . ¡°Hi Ebony .¡± he said back . We walked into his flying black Mercedes-Benz (the license plate said 666 ) and flew to the place with the concert . On the way we listened excitedly to Good Charlotte and Marilyn Manson . We both smoked cigarettes and drugs . When we got there , we both hopped out of the car . We went to the mosh pit at the front of the stage and jumped up and down as we listened to Good Charlotte . ¡°You come in cold , you 're covered in blood They 're all so happy you 've arrived The doctor cuts your cord , hands you to your mom She sets you free into this life .¡± sang Joel (I don 't own da lyrics 2 dat song ). ¡°Joel is so {?} ing hot .¡± I said to Draco , pointing to him as he sung , filling the club with his amazing voice . Suddenly Draco looked sad . ¡°What's wrong ?¡± I asked as we moshed to the music . Then I caught on . ¡°Hey, it 's ok I don 't like him better than YOU !¡± I said . ¡°Really?¡± asked Draco sensitively and he put his arm around me all protective . ¡°Really.¡± I said . ¡°Besides I don 't even know Joel and he 's going out with Hilary {?} ing Duff . I {?} ing hate that little {?} .¡± I said disgustedly , thinking of her ugly blonde face . The night went on really well , and I had a great time . So did Draco . After the concert , we drank some beer and asked Benji and Joel for their autographs and photos with them . We got GC concert tees . Draco and I crawled back into the Mercedes-Benz , but Draco didn 't go back into Hogwarts , instead he drove the car into ¡­¡­¡­¡­¡­¡­¡­¡­¡­ the Forbidden Forest ! Chapter 4.

In this game : - You play as an alien invader against the human race , for a change (thank god ); - You don 't just watch as your towers do all the work -- you fly your airship around , constantly intervening in the battle ; - You can alter your enemies ' paths by connecting your towers to one another or by demolishing buildings so the fallen debris will block their way ; - You can unlock upgrades for your ship and structures . There isn 't a complex research tree though -- by the end of the campaign (or wave 19/20 in Survival ) you will have all the available upgrades . That 's basically it . X-Morph is something between a classic TD and Sanctum (which is the best one of them , IMO ). Although it has a rather small variety of towers available to build , being able to fly and battle around in your ship makes up for it -- keeping busy is a lot more fun than just sitting back and watching . This game also shines in another aspect : you have to put some real thought into how you 're gonna build your defenses . There 's a lot of " path-making " options , and figuring out the best strategy for each map can be quite challenging . They managed to make this very well . The campaign is not very long , and it 's pretty easy . It 's not bad , but nothing great either . Hence the title : " survival is where X-Morph really shines ." The first time I entered Survival mode , right after finishing the Campaign , I hated it . You have about 10 seconds to think / build between waves , so you 're always under pressure and , personally , I don 't like that (you can build anytime during waves though , so ... don 't fret ). But it turns out it 's a lot of fun . First , you gotta plan everything ahead since you won 't have much time to think after the waves start coming , and laying down your defenses poorly will cost you dearly later on . Second , the game allows for interesting defensive layouts , so a good deal of strategy goes into it . Third , when things start to get really intense on later waves , you 'll actually need some skill with your ship to keep surviving , and a lot of focus . Incoming waves and directions are also somewhat randomized , and so are the upgrades you unlock after each wave , so every time you play a map it 's a little different . The Survival mode is where X-Morph 's real challenge lies . Trying to get into the Top 10 scores is really fun . The Campaign entertained me for 14 hours or so , the rest of my playtime was spent on Survival . I 've played a lot of TDs , and I 'd say X-Morph is the second best of them all (Sanctum 2 is the first ).

492,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/925940,stumpo,925940,I write this review for people who have already played Myst , Riven , and Myst III : Exile . and want to know whether to continue playing the series . If you have not played these three games , I suggest you begin with RealMyst Masterpiece Edition and go on from there (maybe buy the Cyan Complete Pack if they update that to include Myst 3 and 4. ). The review below contains spoilers for Myst as well as descriptions of the worlds contained in this game . For everyone else , I think a good review of this game should answer two questions for you : 1 ) Is this game worth playing if you 're a fan of the series ? 2 ) Is the port / release of the game good ? (The answers to those questions below the break ) In general I think Myst 4 remains a good game and I would recommend playing it if you are a fan of the series . I do think it is weaker than the first three games , but I think it still justifies the time that it asks of you . I grew up playing Myst and Riven and just recently got the opportunity to complete Myst 3 : Exile , but had never touched this game before now . I have to admit that my first impression of the game was not good . The current release is full-screen only and 4 :3 resolutions only , so my initial reaction was disappointment in seeing the excellent art design stretched . There is also a design decision that annoyed me up-front and never got better : the transitions between screens are slow , the mouse cursor is sluggish , and in an effort to make the mouse cursor feel more like a hand there are a bunch of animations for the cursor as you mouse over hot spots . This decision makes the entire game feel molasses slow . So , right off the bat , the game had a strike against it . The plot of the game is that Atrus has summoned you to his home to ask you to visit his sons , Sirrus and Achenar , in the ages he has imprisoned them in , to determine if they have reformed and should be let out . While visiting him , he is called away momentarily . Then , all hell breaks loose . The game plays out over a hub world (Tomahna), two prison ages which can be completed in either order (Spire and Haven ), and a finale age (Serenia). The ages are quite large and the game itself feels longer than Myst or Exile for sure . The hub world is beautiful and serves as a good introduction to the game . The two prison ages I liked a lot less -- Spire , specifically , is a beautiful dark prison tower . Is that what Ubisoft Montreal was going for ? Yes . But the fact that I do not want to spend time in the age is a bad thing . Haven is more hospitable but suffers from being truly enormous and having in my opinion too many nodes to navigate . I spent more time mapping than solving any real puzzles . The final area , Serenia , is beautiful and enjoyable . Like the earlier three games , the world design is gorgeous . Sights are frequently breathtaking . I posted a few dozen screenshots for those interested . The engine allows for full 3D looking and every scene is crammed full of layers , animations , and movement . This really does feel like the culmination of the old node-based navigation adventure game . Like the earlier three games , there are some enjoyable puzzles . One in particular , a puzzle involving vibrating crystals , is maybe a little too insane -- the game gives you all the information you need to solve it , but knowing how to apply that information requires a leap I think even seasoned adventure players wouldn 't make . The rest of the puzzles in the game seem to me to be basically solveable given effort and the right set of skills . I found Haven disappointing , because the puzzles felt like busywork -- only the climactic puzzle felt like the kind of spatial / logical puzzle Myst is otherwise known for , while the remainder felt like running around and copying down text and symbols to be able to regurgitate them when prompted . Serenia 's puzzles are great , although the game 's final puzzle was a dud -- easy , annoying , and slow . The music is a little on the nose , and continues the sweeping , epic tradition of Myst 3 : Exile -- but the problem is that it 's hard to feel sad , or angry , or scared , or proud when the music is screaming at you to feel sad , or angry , or scared , or proud . I did want to make a positive note about the music . There is a vocal song which appears at a climactic point of the game . I loved this and had no idea going in it would be a thing . The Steam page description spoils it , which is too bad , because I instantly recognized the vocalist and was pleasantly surprised . I wanted to make one more design complaint / note . In an effort to make the game more interactive , the developers have implemented an audio-log mechanic . The series ' famous journals make a return , this time with voice over . But elsewhere , clues are given by using a pendant to " flash back " to memories that took place in various areas . This , I think , is an error . In addition , I feel most of the actors hired specifically for Revelations are not great . Yeesha , who is a constant presence in the beginning of the game , has flat line readings even for a kid , and the maidens of Serenia are clearly locally hired Montreal actors with accents that distract from the dialogue delivered . I attribute the poor voice direction to the game being developed by a french-first language team . Not that there 's anything wrong with French , and maybe I should have simply played the game in French instead . In terms of whether this is a good port / release ? Not especially , no . I mentioned the stretched resolution and overall sluggishness above . I also think the UI as implemented in the original game is poor and could use a touch-up . The maximum resolution is still fairly low which means subtitles and UI stuff looks pretty bad . No achievements or trading cards . I didn 't encounter any real bugs and I wouldn 't recommend you avoid it on technical grounds , but if you were hoping for improvements , there are none , and if you already own the game on disc I don 't think there are any strong reasons to buy it here . As with any Myst game , good luck solving the puzzles and please try to resist the modern urge to immediately seek a hint (the game does have a sort of preliminary in-line hint system but I don 't think it 's very useful for the one puzzle where you 'll really need one ). Walk around , play with objects you find , take a break , come back to the game , and if you find you get to the end , you 'll feel tremendously satisfied about the breakthroughs you 've made . When you reach a point in Spire where you are in a sort of elevator command center with some crystals in front of you , I do recommend consulting on online hint guide about what to do next ; the result is intuitive but I think you will , like me , waste several hours unsuccessfully trying to make it click . I am really happy to see the entire Myst series under Cyan Worlds ' ownership and published on Steam for people to play . I had a great time playing the game , although again I do feel it is the weakest of the first four games , I 'm confident if you 've played the series this far it is worthwhile for you to continue with Myst 4 , and I hope you enjoy the game if you do .

509,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/IAMThePHiLsTeR/recommended/429660,IAMThePHiLsTeR,429660,Tales of Berseria is one the best games I 've ever played . Of the long list of jrpgs I 've played since the snes era , it 's got to be top 5. This game doesn 't have the tired and cliche , " good guy defeats bad guy and saves the world " story . The main character is actually an anti-hero . We see her start as a normal lovely young lady , and due to a tradegy and years of suffering she transforms . She is now hardened and her heart is filled with pure rage and vengence . However , the story goes on and a much deeper theme develops . I don 't want to spoil anything because it 's just awesome what happens , but know that all the character development is very believable . When it comes to emotions , what the characters feel happens in real life . That 's one of the things that I believe makes this story so great . The gameplay is SUUPPER complicated , but it 's mostly not needed in normal mode . I probably used 5% of the possible strats and got through the game just fine . It especially got a lot easier after I figured out a specific combo (there are a ton of possible combos that you can configure ) that has a high chance of gaining guage for a special move called hidden arte . During hidden arte , you gain damage reduction , " stamina " , and guage toward yet another special move called mystic arts . Because the hidden arte guage was constantly filling up , i was able to spam hidden artes , allowing for very high chaining combos , never ending " stamina " , and relatively fast mystic art charge . I found the combo about 60% through the game and just spammed that same combo over and over . You could be more strategic and use different combos according to enemy weakness , but that likely will only be needed for higher difficulties . The mechanics are so complicated that tutorials still pop up 40% into the game . I would say the only glaring con is that I wished there were more cutscenes of the antogists . Mostly they are described through dialogue when I prefer visual depictions . This game is a must for any jrpg fan . I would also say this is the best " Tales of " game . 10/10

520,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ABCali/recommended/3800,ABCali,3800,Advent Rising houses " great feature " -to-be elements , however most of them does stay not fleshed out or straight bad in execution . One of them is story . Orson Scott Card which is one of my favourite author in SF (writer of Ender 's Game and Speaker of the Dead which is amongst my favourite SF list ) did a quite well job however without the sequels , story stands there as another cliche title . Gameplay is the worst part of the game , I think . From the gunplay point of view , it really fails to structure a good shoot and hit formula . There is no feeling in any of the guns ' usage . Aiming is simplified but doesn 't get to a more qualified level . It is kind of auto aim or you select your target and shoot to him . At some battles this renders some problems , with you not aiming wherever you want and in a TPS title (which would have been a blockbuster , it was to be a quasi rival of halo-unreal-quake type " games . From the point of view of powers , it is a lot enjoyable . I mean once you get them , you will probably do not use any other guns in campaign . But the thing is , it is like you are playing jedi academy which has done this part already a lot lot better . Sound and music are okay . Music kind of get a bit repetitive by the end where in every cinematic it plays the same dramatical music again and again and again . Developers designed this franchise as a trilogy so it carries a movie vibe in it . Therefore , you can find a lot of cinematics here . However , some cinematics are not related or I couldn 't form a relation with the level they are proceeded with . You sometimes teleport to somewhere where the previous cinematic doesn 't end . It 's quite a drawback for a game tries to be like a novel . and at last , bugs . They are everywhere and these are not Heinlein 's Startship Trooper 's bugs , I can assure you . I just can 't imagine how a triple AAA title be just like this clunky , bugged , sterotypical etc . Btw , are these people living in a low gravity environment ? How can they possess such long legs , pretty weird skeleton structure ? hmppf , I guess they left a lot of questions open to us , right ?

You now have found your hidden gem , this game maybe looks plain and simple for some people but I really enjoy it that old feeling of progressing and grindring through games , 2 persons made this game and they are really responsive in discord for whatever issue you are having (first few days into EA , it sounds trite but yes the servers are going through a hard time since a lot of people are trying to play it , why ? because there isn 't any game that are appealing to them ) it doesn 't have loot boxes or any of this new generation of games (you can support the 2 devs paying monthly in patreon or buying skins ingame , not even P2W like a lot of games ) so yes , if you are boring and you have nothing to try and you want to remember back the good old days just try it since is free and fresh , and if you can try to support these 2 amazing devs .

527,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zatchel/recommended/208670,Zatchel,208670,This game is in a weird spot for me , it does not look bad , the time regression ability is really unique , instead of just rewinding (like in most games ) your past self comes back too as some sort of time clone , which , if you keep regressing and repeating will soon turn into a barrage of you own egos attacking at unison , its pretty cool . Everything in the game moves fluidly and has a unique style , but also has some pretty big flaws . The voice acting is horrid , Ayumi (the protagonist ) will keep saying the most inane dialog through the whole thing , keep stating the obvious and just be annoying the whole way to the end , the game needed more polish in the story and in the combat , it also needed more fleshed out characters that CARED about what they are doing . The levels are very linear , some of the puzzles using the time revert are interesting , but the are not the game 's main attractive . It 's also a pretty short game , the whole thing gives this feeling of being mostly a demo of what the studio that created it can do . Overall I guess its worth it just to check out the pretty style the game has and the interesting gameplay mechanic , if you can withstand the bad acting and dialog .

There 's also a lot of weapons and utilities to choose from (utilities can help you in many ways , such as damaging enemies e .g. grenade , sidearm shooter , or boost your movement speed so that you have more options in flanking the enemies ) which allows various ways to succeed at missions , and in addition the maps are randomly generated so it 's unlikely you will play 2 exact same maps , which adds to the variety . Has 5 levels of difficulty so you can take it easy if you 're just interested in the story or if you so desire , there 's a difficult achievement for completing the game at " Elite " difficulty within a certain number of turns , with no casualties or failed / aborted missions . Lastly , I kinda like some of the humour during some of the interactions between characters in between missions , and another thing which I found surprisingly very likable and refreshing was the music , which is country style , and with very appropriate lyrics matching the game . Looking forward to play the other games by this developer in the future !
533,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/itsjimbofresh/recommended/238460,itsjimbofresh,238460,I nominated this game for the " Game Within A Game " award during the Steam 2016 Autumn sale . Why ? Because of the basketball mini game that 's in the multiplayer mode . So . much . fun . Other than that , this game is a very unique but well-done platformer with cool mechanics and local / online multiplayer modes . It plays well , and also has a stage creator for those who like to make their own level builds . A must-buy worthy of the $2.99 80% price tag when it 's on sale (it's not always ). I don 't think it 's amazing value at $15 retail , but put this on your wish list and wait for a sale that 's as good as previously mentioned .

It 's received intermittent play since release on Steam as I 've been too busy with a couple other games and with the amount of content that 's been added this will need every neuron I can spare . I plan to give a more full flavor review once it 's released and I 've actually " finished " a game . Just wanted to give it a little nudge back towards 100% overwhelmingly positive reviews .

It 's cheap but you 'll almost certainly play it just once and then forget about it . There 's no achievements or leaderboards either , though I wouldn 't recommend it even if there were . The brief bits of gameplay shown in the trailer are the entire game . All the stages look identical and the gameplay never changes - just press the right button at the right time and end the stage with a button-mashing minigame . The music is all farty chiptune arrangements of classic Christmas carols (no metal mixes like the one in the trailer ). Again , kind of funny for a few moments but that 's it .

539,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/waywardwatergod/recommended/257790,waywardwatergod,257790,Story : - / 5 This is the same template I use to review games so that 's why the story section shows up here . There is no story in Riptide since it 's just an arcade racer but you won 't be expecting one either . Gameplay & Controls : 3.5/5 Riptide GP2 's control scheme is suited to controllers and feels smooth enough , you will sometimes find yourself a little annoyed at the course layout in the later parts of the game when you have fully souped up late-game hydro jets ¨C I know one course in particular there 's a boat you cannot avoid hitting without ignoring your boost for a few stunt ramps which just feels like a design oversight but overall the levels are fun and I don 't try and avoid too many of them . The icy stages sometimes feel overly snakey however . I feel like I just didn 't look into this long enough but there needs to be a way to shut your boost off and I don 't think there is , if I 'm wrong please feel free to let me know , that alone will bring the score up . It must be said that I love Vector Unit 's wave and water mechanics a lot though . Music & Sound : 2.5/5 The music is fitting but that 's about all I can say about it . Vector Unit likes to supply their games with a fairly energetic soundtrack and cycle through it at random , that 's a little disappointing for a few people . It doesn 't seem like they put a lot of thought into how they use their soundtracks . It doesn 't stick out too much but I know some people play games solely for their scores and it seems like it 'd be worth exploring in the future . Hydro Thunder Hurricane was the same way but the music in that game was actually exciting and if there was a particular track you really enjoyed you could select it at the beginning of each race . Again , it 's not something I looked too far into but the music in GP2 isn 't anything special anyway so ¡­ eh . Visuals : 5/5 The game is pretty , and I love the animations your riders have for their stunts . I 'm a massive sucker for crisp looking aquatic effects so I can 't complain about anything here , stunning game guys . With Riptide Renegade on the horizon I 've been checking prerelease videos of that out and it looks even better so I would say this is something Vector Unit excels at . Overall : 3/5 I give this a 3/5 , there are some things that can be improved upon and if there are some mechanics I 've just missed then I can bump it up to maybe a 4 but it would feel generous . I have to say that I do enjoy playing it so I will recommend it , but be prepared for an annoying grind session before you can do anything fun . That would have to be my biggest gripe . You don 't start out with a hydro jet you can use for very many races so you find yourself grinding races for cash until you can get a few upgrades or a new jet and move on . The online community is pretty scarce which is another shame since VU 's Hydro Thunder Hurricane 's online play was a delightful experience in comparison . I remember playing HTH online with a few members of the dev team and remembered how stoked they seemed to be when it came to making games like this so I am very hopeful for everything they release later on down the line . Now if only we can get a follow-up of HTH I will hail Vector Unit as my indie hero .

549,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ddrcdt/recommended/266840,ddrcdt,266840,Age of Mithology is a classic RTS that absolutely deserves to be played by newer generations . Though the graphics are not gentle to the eye after all those years (they were once a pinnacle of the polygonal era ), the game itself has aged well , with tried-and-true mechanics , interesting roster of factions and a robust multiplayer scene even to this very day . The original campaign is pretty good , albeit cheesy in some parts (remember the script 's epoch influences ). The map editor is simple to use . Not much else to remark , there are some flaws here and there but nothing earth-shattering . The revival with the new expansion is a welcome addition . Although it doesn 't change the gameplay , the addition of an entire new roster is cool . The new campaign , however , is completely forgettable . There 's nothing else to say but to recommend the game !

Back in the ps2 era , I had already bought the game and loved it . It was different from other ff , especially when it comes to the plot . Tidus , the main character , felt a lot more human than anyone else in previous titles (some may argue he 's kind of a wimp , but ... I don 't know , maybe ?) and the entire plot , even though it gets as convoluted as any other ff game , it has a inner intimate dimension built around the character that truly makes you care about all the people involved . That being said , battles are faster (there's also an option in here to speed up the game , which is very useful ) music is fantastic and , overall , the artistic design can deliver some interesting scenarios here and there . A nice port of a wonderful game . Ps . Don 't play FFX-2. Given the choice , i 'd refused to download it to begin with .

Or " trap " (singular). The Boulder . If you step under a hole in the ceiling , a boulder will fall from it and crush you . It doesn 't matter what class you 're using , your level , how strong you are or how far down the mines you 've gone -- you 're dead . As if having to play the entire game , from start to finish , looking up at the ceiling wasn 't bad enough , it gets worse : you don 't neccessarily need to step under the boulder-holes . If you get within a certain range , or step in a square with a direct , straight view to one of them , you 'll hear a rumble and then have something between half a second and 2 to get out of the boulder 's way , or it 's game over . In short , no matter what you do your game will sudden and randomly end . Everything you did is gonna go to waste , and you 'll have to start over ... just to die to another boulder , yet again . That alone makes Barony unplayable (or just " not worth playing " , in case you 're a masochist ). Other than that , the game is pretty simple . Items are just +0, +1, +2, and so on . There are rare , legendary ones with a special effect (at least the one I found had it ) but that 's all . And it doesn 't matter if you find one of them anyway , because a boulder will find you soon afterwards . Fights are simple : block , strike . If you don 't have a shield ... well , find one , because spell / ranged combat seems to suck , although my experience with those were very limited . Managing your inventory is also a pain in the S , and there 's no tooltip for what items actually do . You just gotta wear them and see if you notice anything unusual . The " amulet / ring of teleportation ," for instance , apparently teleports you randomly to another spot on the map , so ... it 's useless . You also have no means to know how much Magic you need to learn a spell written in some random book you found . Oh , there 's also a Minotaur who might randomly spawn in a level and r *pe you . You gotta exit the level quickly , or you 'll die . You can disable the Minotaur , Hunger (which is another annoying thing .. as well as having to use torches all the time ...) and the Traps on options but , sadly , it doesn 't really work with the latter . The Boulder will always be there to ruin your game . Last but not least , there 's no consistent progression in this game . You do not unlock anything , there 's no improvement whatsoever after each run , nothing changes (other than the levels themselves , which are randomly generated ).
553,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SteveEvets4Ever/recommended/337000,SteveEvets4Ever,337000,This game is quite an interesting one since it has mixed reviews , and that it isn 't as big as Deus Ex : Human Revolution . However , I enjoyed this game to the very end . I liked the music . Very heavy in atmosphere , and I wouldn 't mind playing it in the background while I do work or study . I also enjoyed the level design as well . There were many other ways to get to certain objectives , so if I did replay the game , it would be a different playthrough with different approaches . Which brings me to the story telling . There were certain choices in the game that really made think for a good few minutes on what I really wanted to make those choices . I felt that the player was challenged morally in a side quest even if it had not much to do with the main story . I also enjoyed many of the quiet moments in the game , such as returning to Task Force 29 or Adam 's Apartment . These moments sell me in on Jensen and the people around him , more so than Deus Ex : Human Revolution did . Perhaps this game 's negativity comes from how it 's cut into different DLC so you aren 't exactly enjoying the full game . I recommend getting this game if you had a chance when everything goes on sale , but besides the DLC cut , this game was another enjoyable experience .

Basically it 's about a guy who , in wanting to achieve success in life , seized the properties of 3 people for the company that he is working for (I learnt that distraint is an actual word that means " the seizure of someone 's property in order to obtain money owed , especially rent " ). Throughout the game , we see how he starts to lose it after the first distraint until the point that he feels that he needs to quit his job after the third distraint ... I will leave it at that but suffice to say that the story was something I enjoyed a lot , particularly the twist that I didn 't foresee at the end which left me in awe , especially when I replayed the first part again (while trying to get some achievements that I missed in my first playthrough ) and could appreciate the connection between the start and the end ... Gameplay wise , you are basically going around talking to people , finding and using objects and it has some puzzles along the way akin to those you see in hidden object / point-and-click games . Perhaps the only drawback is that the game is quite short (probably about 2 hours ) but for a game that is almost single-handedly created (from game design , art , music ) - the main source of help was from his wife who contributed some ideas - it 's a brilliant effort and definitely worth some time and a few bucks to support the fella . =)

I wondered what could be so fun about driving trucks ... as opposed to racing games . When I finally got the game on sale I realized of course . 1. Trucks will be driven . Yeah , definitely that . 2. The Euro Map is incredibly fun to explore with several expansion countries . 3. The paint jobs are cool to paint , and paint over , and repaint ... so many designs . 4. Building your own trucks , upgrading to better parts , choosing models and makes ... that . 5. Hiring employees to make you money so you can ... paint more trucks for your own fleet of trucks you won 't let anyone else drive . 6. The engineering marvels , bridges , etc . around the maps . 7. The AI drivers ... you can shove them around and wreck in hilarious ways . Accidentally and / or on purpose . There 's more , but I need to go repaint my truck . It 's a great game though and I highly recommend it . And , I 'm looking forward to the Beyond the Baltic expansion . But , there is a learning curve . Be prepared to wrap your truck around the highway guardrails many times as you are learning to drive a rig unless you are an ace game driver , unlike some of us who are prone to see the highway upside down every now and again .

603,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/288160,stumpo,288160,The Room (note: not based on the films The Room or Room !) is a point and click puzzle game that will be familiar to anyone who has played a room escape video game or done a live action room escape . You are in the haunted attic of a mansion and you find an elaborate and ornate box . By flipping levers and dials , pressing buttons , putting keys in locks , and generally fiddling you slowly open more and more of the box and learn about the secret of the room . The plot is mostly flavour and mood rather than a concrete narrative . Puzzles are fun and generally fair . The game looks gorgeous . At 2-3 hours , I think the game is priced appropriately . I want to emphasize two things for people considering the game : First , the built-in hint system is excellent . Automatically after fiddling around for a while , if you 're not making progress , the game will help you by giving you a hint prompt . Click on it and you 'll progressively get more information . In this way you never feel stuck or under pressure . If you 're getting frustrated , take a hint . If not , that 's okay too . Second , while the visuals on the PC version are excellent , the controls remain optimized for touch platforms . The game is very tactile , lots of dragging and rotating and moving things . Although this is replicated here via mouse controls , I think it 's probably a little more playable on a tablet for that reason . I beat the game on iPad a few years ago and replayed here . I believe the game is generally cheaper on tablets as well . So if you 're a big Steam collector , prefer playing everything on PC , or just want to support the devs , by all means buy this , but if you 're considering both the tablet version and this version . I 'd go iPad first . Looking forward to the third installment being released on Steam .
604,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xathier337/recommended/252490,Xathier337,252490,It 's an interesting game . It 's basically an MMO , so you 're gonna run into a lot of crappy people who want nothing but to kill you for no other reason than sport , and it 's gonna be the most emotionally draining thing , not to forget frustrating . Few days of hard work , down the drain , for no other reason than people just being jerks . When you do run into people who not only not want to kill you , but also even HELP YOU , this game absolutely shines . It 's a great experience . So it 's honestly up to you in if you want to buy it or not . Personally , I 'd wait for a sale , and get a copy for a friend , or better , play with someone experienced . This game is confusing as heck , you won 't know what to do , and once you start getting your foot in the door of the basics on wht to do , it 's gonna get hard . Personal : 5/10. Your experience is solely based of whether or not people are jerks and hate you for no reason . No single-player . Can 't make a server for just you and friends , simply . Edit : Also your appearance is randomized and set based on your Steam ID . Not being able to change appearances at all sucks , and the devs including some of the community praise this decision . Personally , I think it 's needlessly stupid , and I want to be represented in a game I paid money for , thanks .
605,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/arcangle/recommended/274230,arcangle,274230,Ronin is a very fun game that is similar to Gunpoint or Deadbolt in certain aspects . The unique feature that set this game aside from others is that once an enemy spots you , the combat shifts to turn based mode instead of real time . This is where a lot of people complain about weird mechanics and unpredictable enemy fire , but after spending several hours on it , I 've beaten every stage , new game + mode included . In hindsight , there are multiple ways to kill most of the mobs , what seemed impossible at first becomes easy as one masters blade control and frame timing . - Fans of Gunpoint / Deadbolt will likely find this game enjoyable - Very solid game design - Has a very high difficulty ceiling and therefore , some stages will be impossible to beat until one masters every aspect of the combat - Has a few visibility bugs , ex . the scientist who looks out from behind a window will not be able to spot you if you climbed across on the ceiling before his eyes - The story is pretty much non-existent . But who cares about a story when the game 's so fun ? P .S.: Flying blade triple kill is a thing .

608,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/n00bninja/recommended/242680,n00bninja,242680,Nuclear Throne is an amazing game made by Vlambeer . It 's fast paced , filled with content (even for an early access game !) and tough . It is a rogue-like (or rogue-lite if you like to get technical ) and your goal is to shoot and kill your way to the next level , in hopes to reach the Nuclear Throne . As of now the lore of the game is a bit cryptic , but there is definetly one . The only way to know what is going on with it is to hear what the devs say along the way , but in the future it will be more story-filled . The art style is very appealing if you enjoy pixel art , and so far everything is pretty detailed for it being a early access game . There will be more details , but as of now it looks great the way it is . Level design is random , meaning you get different layouts each time you play , unless you use a seed . Every few levels brings you to a new 'world', giving a nice bit of variety . I believe there will be more levels when it is finished , but for now there is a nice selection of designs . The music is great , I am not very good at describing music , so if you click here , you can listen to some of the music . As of now , there isn 't much variation , but almost every stage has a 'B' track that has a small chance of playing , and is a nice change to what plays normally , in the future , there will be more music for each stage . Character selection , there is quite a lot to choose from . So far , there are 9 different characters . Each have unique passives and abilities . These are subject to change as the game is still in early-access . Each time you level up in Nuclear Throne , you get a 'mutation', these allow you to enhance your weapons and yourself , giving extra health , less enemy health , longer reach with melee , etc . The replayability is very high , as you won 't be able to reach the Throne on your first few tries . And there are many different builds for different characters you can make . And there will be many future updates until it is finished . _________________________________________________________ Overall , I believe Nuclear Throne is worth your time , with a great art style , fast paced action , many different weapons to use , and a good bunch of characters to choose from , it is great , even in early access . If you get NT , but keep failing over and over , don 't quit . Just take a rest , warm up at the fire , and try again . Because one day , you will reach the Nuclear Throne .

This game is perfect for my toddler (2 yr old ) when he feels like watching dad play something . I 'll put it on and he 'll watch while dad plays with the big trucks . I 'll find myself redoing a challenge here and there because I know he loves watching my exaggerated sound effects when I make the trucks fly off ramps . I 've found myself even playing alone once or twice for 20-30 mins to see if I can up my score here and there . Treat this game as a perfect little time waster if you have time to waste or a toddler to entertain . Otherwise steer clear .

613,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBlueberryPoptart/recommended/707590,TheBlueberryPoptart,707590,Defense Clicker at it 's core is a very simple tower defense , idle , clicker game that does these things right . You start by building a tower to start the wave based game-play of monsters . These monsters range from ground types to flying , bosses and ultra bosses (gods) and some will have unique abilities (more health , damage absorption , speed , bonus drops , summon monsters , teleportation , ect ,) There is a day / night cycle and weather system (rainy and snow ) that will change monster stats . You can set the wave difficulty higher and more monsters for more of a challenge . You 'll start to obtain " resources " to start upgrading your towers for more damage , speed , range , ect , some pets to obtain resources when they drop on the field (keep upgrading them to gather resources faster ), other pets that attack monsters and some heroes to help you to kill monsters . You have an in-game level you can level up by killing monsters and when you reach certain level requirements you 'll open up jobs (a sort of side class you can all so level up and get more gold , damage to clicks , more tower damage globally (so leveling each job class helps )). Once you finish a run you can reset for some evo 's, these will allow you to upgrade some passives to help you go farther in runs and most upgrades to gold and resources storage goes back to normal (need to upgrade each run , some passives can upgrade +gold storage ). There has been some good and consistent updates to the game . The dev is very helpful and active in the discussions when someone has a question . Events are planned (just had the Halloween event and had a pet you could get by gather Halloween drops in-game , once you obtained the pet each 5k drops you picked up added 1 extra damage the pet did ) and there 271 achievements to get too . I definitely recommend this game to anyone that liked the idle , tower base games . If you are interested in Steam inventory items this game has x1 drops every hour , drop timer resets when you reset the map . Steam Inventory Guide
614,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ziem/recommended/317510,ziem,317510,What is Beyond Gravity ? You play some sort of astronaut jumping from planet to planet , trying to collect the items floating between them . That sums up the whole game , basically . You may have already noticed that Beyond Gravity is a 2D game , so the " planets " are more or less just rotating disks . The " planets " vary in size and angular velocity . The description of the game mentions it is " procedurally generated " , I guess that is what they meant . As you progress through the game , the " planets " get smaller , they rotate faster and the distance between them increases . To deal with the growing difficulty , you can spend the picked up items to buy some upgrades . Now you can do multiple jumps in the air (space?), jump faster , pick up items at a greater distance , but nothing that changes the fundamental mechanics of the game . Additionally , the price for the upgrades is quite high , so you need to play again and again until you can afford to buy some upgrades , resulting in a gameplay that feels repetitive really quick (read: grindfest ). Again , what is Beyond Gravity ? Long story short : it is a simple flash game . The kind of game you can play on the web . I have no idea what the first flash games were , but they have been around for 15 years , easily . The more sophisticated ones , at least . So , the thing is , there are dozens of flash games out there that are better than Beyond Gravity . And they are free . On the plus side , Beyond Gravity has nice animations , and the visual style is pretty cute . And it has one distinct advantage over flash games on the web : achievements . My rating : For the genre (flash games ): 58 / 100 For the grand scheme of gaming things : 5 / 100 My library categories : Flash , Trash
615,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/414340,Faudraline,414340,If we feel our way into the human secrets of the sick person , the madness also reveals its system , and we recognize in the mental illness merely an exceptional reaction to emotional problems which are not strange to us . -- Carl G . Jung , " The Content of the Psychoses " This is going to be one of those reviews that one would have a truckload to say about , yet when it comes to actually saying something , one ends up empty handed . I will try nonetheless . One thing is sure : playing Hellblade : Senua 's Sacrifice , was both a magnificent and harrowing experience . Ninja Theory , a development studio based on Cambridge , UK - one we may remember from Enslaved : Odyssey to the West and the latest part of Devil May Cry series , DmC : Devil May Cry - even though being relatively young in the market , accomplished an exceptional task with this game . Here , we take on the role of Senua , a Pict warrior , hailing from Northern Scotland . All we know about her at the beginning of the game , is that Senua has lost her lover , Dillion , to a Viking raid and now she must take on a journey to the Nordic underworld : Helheim , to rescue him . The opening cinematic closely follows Senua as she journeys from the banks of Orkney to this supposed entrance to the underworld . A far away , soft and feminine voice starts talking about Senua 's tragedy , and her unique , disturbing nature ... and only when she hears the voice talking , and turns back towards the camera , directly looking at us , we realize Senua 's sense of what is real may not be the reality that we all are aware of . Okay , here , I 'll start about that part which may be considered as spoilers , so be warned . Senua is a young Celtic warrior like no other : she is schizophrenic . This whole game , is much , much more than simply being a game . It is a direct medium designed to present the player the very experience of being schizophrenic . Our heroine will keep hearing voices , experience hallucinations , collect meaning from most trivial of natural occurrences and will go through periods of dire anxiety and paranoia . All that we encounter within the game , is how Senua interprets and experiences the reality , rather than an objective reality . Her journey to the underworld , her battles against the darkness , her combats with various gods , the challenges she continuously and ferociously overcome : are simply metaphors for her battle against the psychosis itself . At the end of the day , what actually happened to Senua is tragically simple : yet how she overcomes it , is a Herculean task nonetheless . What is downright marvelous about this game , is the character Senua herself . Melina Juergens , who performed Senua 's voice acting and motion capturing throughout the game , presents an astonishing feat of acting . Her mimics , her tone , her gaze , her whole-body language continuously display a typhoon of emotions , practically enforcing you to live Senua 's dark , horrific , painful reality . I strongly recommend watching the short documentary on the game after completing it , so you can witness the whole process yourself . Apparently , the developmental team worked with not only history professors for setting authenticity concerning Norse mythology and Celtic culture , yet they also worked with psychiatrists , specialists on psychosis and even psychotic patients themselves for an accurate representation . This whole creative process in no less than being fascinating ! I 've already mentioned that the motion capture was used to enact characters . At this point , I also must note the Unreal Engine 4 presents a majestic scene when it comes to display a sense of realism . Textures , lights , colors and animations are no less than being breath-taking . This has been one VR worthy experience . I sadly lack the equipment , yet if you have a VR device , I strongly recommend trying . Another incredible display quality is the audio atmosphere of the game . As you keep playing , you 'll keep hearing various voices , continuously commenting on your mood , your actions , your situation to better simulate paracusia , or auditory hallucinations . Thus , playing the game with headphones on will hugely benefit to the atmosphere . Let 's talk gameplay at this point , shall we ? The game may be categorized as an adventure game with action elements . You will travel through various parts of the said geography and handle endless visual and some auditory puzzles . Every now and then , you will face adversaries in the form of grotesque Viking warriors and even some of their gods . Puzzles are incredibly creative , yet some require an obsessive amount of attention to detail . I loved it since it adds to the atmosphere , yet I agree that it is not everyone 's cup of tea . You just should know what you 'll be in for , when you are playing this game . It is a simulation and an experience , enwrapped within a historical setting and a story of tragedy . It is not your casual action-adventure ; and it surely isn 't the next God of War . If you are looking for simply a bad-as s game , this is not it . If you are looking for a challenging experience which will test not only your skills , but your own psych : please try it . You won 't be disappointed . At the very beginning of the game , you will be warned that every time you fail , the rot on Senua 's body will progress ; and if you fail enough times , that would be the end of Senua 's journey . This warning immediately started a rumor about a permadeath function about the game . According to the rumor , if you die enough times , your save games will be automatically erased , and you 'll have to start over . Now , that is a brilliant hoax . The game says nothing about permadeath . You reach that conclusion based on a false impression yourself . There is no permadeath in the game . Yet , the warning and various following scenes are brilliantly places there to create that kind of assumption to feed into the horror factor . The game literally forces you to share Senua 's reality , even though that might not be what is objectively real . I call that simply brilliant . At the end of the day , Hellblade : Senua 's Sacrifice is a unique yet highly disturbing game , and one you won 't soon forget . Please be warned , and try it , if you are willing to appreciate video games as a medium for art and a simulation on the more disturbing side .

This fubar along with ugly response from players was so powerful that i didnt fork down money for this until much much later still very much sure that i am wasting my money . Alas no the game is a masterpiece and the best Deus Ex game to this day and it 's a big shame it didn 't sell better than it did . Deus Ex HR has been the king of the hill here for quite some time but this one does to that what Arkham City did to the first Batman game : Faster , Higer , Stronger in every way and the story itself is not that bad either . And there is actually pretty decenbt conclusion to the story if you have the patience to see things to the end . (of course there is a cliffhanger of things to come ). Buy it . And by that i mean buy the base version . Don 't bother with the DLCs , the ones that doomed this game launch in the first place . They are still there and they are a sorry testament to this incomprehensible 'pay to shorten your game experience by buying xp ' -stuff . Ignore it and play the game to the full . There is plenty of Praxis to go around and you will get a taste of all the toys . Multiple branches to stories of course too so if youi got the time play it again with another strategy . 10/10 despite everything .

630,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/48190,Faudraline,48190," I thought my work was done . I was wrong . Once more , I must venture into the fray . By recruiting enemies of the state , we arm those who have been disarmed by the Borgia . The greed , the corruption , the tyranny my enemies have spread will burn to the ground . From the ashes of vengeance , a new Rome will rise ." ¨DEzio Auditore da Firenze , Assassin 's Creed : Brotherhood Launch Trailer . It has taken some time for me to complete this one , yet here we are : Assassin 's Creed : Brotherhood is the third game in the series , and the second part that follows Ezio 's storyline . There is a reason that this game is a fan favorite , since it contains the allure of the previous game , yet brings in various new features and a truckload to attend and discover . If you have enjoyed the previous game , you 'll love this one . Renaissance Italy is yet again here for us to roam in , with one glorious city at our disposal . It seems that the old saying was true all along : all roads lead to Rome . Well , considering we are already deep into the series at this point , I 'll throw my casual " will contain spoilers " warning here , just for your attention . Previously in our game , Ezio discovered that he has bitten more than he could chew with the revelation of a message coming to Desmond beyond time . A secret room in Vatican revealed the involvement of parties alien and unseen , parties even godly ; and the Animus session got cut short with a Templar raid on our modern assassins ' hideout . As templars descended upon Desmond and the crew , they have managed to narrowly escape with their lives and hit the road for the ancestral home of Auditore family : Monteriggioni . Now , setting base in Monteriggioni 's underground halls , well below the satellite range of any Abstergo machination , our heroes keep delving into Ezio 's memories to get a clue about the fate of the Apple of Eden . Going back to Ezio 's story , he 'll soon discover that he has committed a crucial mistake by letting Pope Roderigo Borgia live . He goes back to Monteriggioni with Uncle Mario to discuss the events of Vatican with the rest of his allies , only to wake up to a bloody dawn . As Cesare Borgia arrives to his doorstep with an army , Ezio once again loses all he has : his home , his uncle and the apple- yet not his vengeance and hope for a new dawn . As Ezio escapes the siege barely with his life , he arrives to Roma , the very cradle of Borgia dominance and decides to take the war to Borgia for a change . Here , he will reinstate the Assassin Order by recruiting and training a younger generation of assassins to take the city back from the Borgia . Exciting , huh ? Welcome to Assassin 's Creed : Brotherhood or " City Building : How I Have Rebuilt Rome Edition " . Rome is a huge city , and it bears countless side quests , collectibles , guild missions , Leonardo mission , unlockables and even some personal memories coming from Ezio 's tragic past . I strongly recommend acquiring as many Borgia towers and shops as possible early in the game to establish a steady income . Things to do seemingly won 't have an end , and each little thing you do will unlock a new ability , a new piece of equipment or a new narrative to the era itself . In this game , we will follow Ezio 's life from its mid-forties to its mid-fifties . Our beloved assassin doesn 't recover from injuries as quickly as he used to , but he is still the daredevil that we know him to be and the benefit of wisdom brings in a new arsenal to him too . Now , he is not alone . As you burn down Borgia towers and assassinate officials , you will recover the city piece by piece ; and you will steadily recruit young assassins to do your bidding . You will send them on missions far and wide , for them to get experience , and even let them accompany you in your own missions . By the end , Ezio will be given the title of the Mentor , as the man who saved the Italian Brotherhood . The setting , so far , is the best in the series . The whole city truly lives , and Ubisoft managed to come close to the notion of an open world in this one . As you travel the streets , you 'll witness random interactions between citizens , people attending their daily business ; contrary to them roaming certain paths aimlessly , as it was in previous games . Day / Night cycle will enhance the atmosphere and will even present various advantages to you . Various authentic landmarks of Rome are open to visit , and countless wondrous screenshot opportunities will be at hand . Streets are vibrant with the culture of the era , and the nature itself is a beauty to behold , from harbors to lush forests ; from valleys to mountain peaks . As a side note , it was a breathtaking moment to take a leap of faith from the top of the great Colosseum . The historical connotation of the series persists with the return of various figures and the introduction of new ones . Prepare to pay a visit to Leonardo da Vinci again , or cross paths with Copernicus . Machiavelli will do his best to aid us in any manner , and saving Catherine Sforza from a gruesome fate will be a priority . Again , all relevant philosophies , manners and the spirit of the age is narrated within appropriate storylines . The series is a godsend for any history buff . There sure are inconsistencies , but one should keep in mind that the world here is a fictional claim anyhow . Let 's talk gameplay as a closing note : controls are not at their best . Camera angles are hellish , and parkours are a b *tch since you 'll never know towards what direction Ezio may decide to leap . Camera angles constantly change during the missions to show you the way that you should follow , but they mostly make you lose balance by changing movement controls too . It takes a great amount of getting used to in this PC port . Some missions expect you to attend things in certain manners for full synchronization , so I bid you good luck on managing a kill strike 10 times in a row with obscure enemy lock-ins . You will have a hard time . Controls still lag , key combinations do not register from time to time and Ezio manages to latch on to every unnecessary surface when he tries to run during missions . Aside that little problem , the game is a small masterpiece . I hope you will enjoy this one as much as I did . Ezio trilogy is the first time that we watch the passage of a whole era in the series , so it holds a special place for most fans . You witness the time and life of Ezio as a whole : all this growth , both in abilities and personality . I 'll be expecting much , much more from the next in the series : Assassin 's Creed : Revelations . Enjoy !

It captures the more calming game experiences that were present during the 16bit era , and updates it for modern gaming . There is still some fighting and combat , but most of the action is at a slower pace . I would really enjoy seeing more games like this produced . The care the original developer put into this game is evident at every turn , something that is missing in modern AAA games .
642,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/epee/recommended/234650,epee,234650,Campaign : 7/10 Toolset : 9/10 This game is an amazing purchase at under $20 if you are only vaguely familiar with the Shadowrun universe . It is even better if you are a Shadowrun fan . The engine is reminiscent of Black Isle era D &D, but simpler and with a modern feel . If you enjoyed games like Icewind Dale , Arcanum , or the old Divinity , this will be right up your alley . The campaign is fun and well-polished although it only lasts around 12 hours--- short for a single player rpg . It has minimal replay value as you can easily try out other classes by picking up hirelings . Still , the campaign is worth the $20 tag . The real gem is the free Neverwinter Nights style toolset . Expect an avalanche of community made campaigns to come out this year . If NWN was anything to go by , the earliest releases will be mostly garbage , but eventually the modding community will surpass the devs , who are also making new campaigns that will be available as relatively cheap DLC .

645,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/icegriffin93/recommended/239350,icegriffin93,239350,This game is more frustrating than it is fun . I tried to give it a chance , going several rounds after dying several unfair deaths , but .. that 's just what the game is . Unfair and frustrating . First problem I had before even playing was the inability to rebind some actions to the same key . Which normally I wouldn 't mind except the game has 3 different buttons for Up . One for jump , one for entering a door , and another for climbing up ladders . It would be soooo much more convenient if I could have these three actions on the same button , but I can 't. And then , there 's the entire game full of frustrating gimmicks such as chucking a weapon that bounces off a wall and hits you , or a trap that appears at the edge of the screen that shoots an arrow lightning fast at you , catapulting you across the stage .. falling on spikes is an insta-kill , smashing a pot while moving ends up harming you if an enemy is inside it , the painfully tiny hitbox of your whip , some dark levels where a spider from above which you couldn 't even see falls down at mach 5 right on top of you , and so many other annoying things .. I remember hearing and seeing this game before it released and think I played a demo of it .. I was so excited but I 'm completely disappointed . This game 's not fun- it 's frustrating and annoying .

There 's really no indication of when difficulty increases dramatically and you just die to a random unbeatable fight . You basically just wander around until you get slaughtered by a random difficulty spike . You just pick up a quest and sail over to it just to find out you have no chance to beat it at all , no chance to leave , and permadeath losing all your progress . Fun ! This whole " roguelike / lite " obsession indie devs have these days really need to end . No one wants to waste time losing progress if they have a busy life schedule . Just let us save already , and have a conherent consistent gameplay instead of making everything random with wild difficulty swings . This isn 't like a player skill based game like Binding of Isaac where you can make up for bad luck item drops by playing better . You can just enter a turn based fight you have no chance to win just based on your character 's number stats , enemies outnumbering you , and lose . Complete randomness affecting every aspect of gameplay is just a lazy dev 's crutch to cover poor gameplay design . There are also way too many buffs and debuffs to keep track of . In one round of combat your character can get debuffed and crippled like 8 + times , and some of these seem to randomly (? unexplained mechanic ) give you permanent disabilities after the fight . Not sure why this is considered a fun element by the devs . A 3 movement melee range character suddenly losing 1 movement forever is a silly unfun mechanic . And again , the game doesn 't explain whether you can actually remove these seemingly permanent disabilities . Maybe the Inn lets you remove disabilities ? I wouldn 't know because it costs more than 4x your starting cash to stay at an Inn , and in 1 hour of gameplay I never even got close to picking up that much cash from random events . I got a ton of food and can heal back to full health , get a health blessing from the elves , but still crippled . Yay .... The ability descriptions will tell you it applies a debuff but won 't explain what it actually does . You have to actually sucessfully apply a 25% chance to hit debuff before you can even hover over it to find out what it actually does . This is really poor UI and game mechanic design . Do you really want to spend 4 + turns trying to cast a debuff just to find out whether it is useful to you or not ? Why not spam the debuff that has 75% chance to hit instead ? There is a base and potential here for a good game , but the current design decisions are very flawed .
652,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tripleextraultradose/recommended/232090,tripleextraultradose,232090,Here we 've got a pretty promising game which I 've had the pleasure of recieving two updates for , I 'm quite pleased with the content being supplemented however the gap between each of these updates is pretty substantial , leaving the community desiring more . However I feel that the recent uproar of 'gamers' getting upset over the addition of optional cosmetics whilst being somewhat justified , is rather another stupid bandwagon of kids following the stigmatised 'microtransactions' around like some sort of bread crumb trail . Rather than listening to and parroting the opinions of people like Jim Sterling , consider this as an alternative . Look at the actual product you 're paying for admittal and make your judgements based on that , the key / crate system that has been adapted into this game has a minimal impact on the actual game itself other than the ability to further personalize your weapons / avatar . Killing Floor 2 is a GOOD game which has followed with some quality updates and I anticipate further content to be just as good , however a bunch of immature people are going to grab their pitchforks and jump on a band wagon due to a business practice which has been adopted and well recieved in other games . And yes , it 's quite evident that this is a bandwagon in microtransactions given the sheer contradictory that the people complaining about microtransactions show . Take a look at the reactions to Payday 2 , all this aggression due to microtransactions with a minimal impact on the game being labelled as 'pay 2 win '. While they had a decline in quality and quantity in each of their DLC packs , however these packs were continually praised . I 'm certain this is just going to be rated down without reading though .

(3-6 at a time ) -Your companion will ALWAYS die . Yes , in every fight it will drop to 1 or 2 enemies pretty quickly . -So you really don 't have any companion or help in this game , luckily it gets back up after combat ends . -You can be fighting a mob of people or monsters and the guards / npc 's will stand around and watch . -It 's primarily a melee game , you get scarce amounts of supplies to make some bullets , that go pretty quickly . -The story is pretty straight forward , but a little boring . I didn 't feel compelled to hunt out and do any side quests like you would normally do in most RPG 's. -The atmosphere is what initially lured me to the game , I like sci-fi RPG 's. and on Mars ? What a plus . -Voice acting is awful , graphics aren 't anywhere close to great , and the combat can be a little sketchy at times . Regardless of the flaws , this game had me entertained enough to finish it . It 's short , especially for an RPG , but if purchased on sale , I would recommend at least giving this game a try . You will either hate it , or not mind it , but you won 't love it . 6/10

THE CONS : There was too much crap that you had to collect . Crafting was stupid . You couldn 't get some of the equpiment until you were most of the way through the game . By then , you forgot about all of the goodies you had to leave behind . What the hell was the point of the lockpick ? You have an axe already . Then , you had an " axe grapple " ? Psh . Lastly , you only got 2 salvage from salvage crates . By the end of the game , most of the guns weren 't fully upgraded because there was no salvage anywhere . I 'm thankful that you didn 't have to upgrade ALL of your guns to get 100% completion . In-game enemy encounters (in groups ) are rare once you 've completed the game , so you have to play it over again to obtain some achievements that you missed . There was too much stupid crap that you needed to do to obtain all of the game 's Achevements . I have tried to connect to two friends in the co-op mode , but the connections are too unstable . What the hell is the point of having a leaderboard for a game without a true multiplayer ? What the hell is the point of " challenge cards " ? Just give me permanent skills that don 't freaking go away after 1 freaking use . Whoopty freaking dooo . I can waste a challenge card slot looking like the Lara of old . Some of those are so stupid . Whoopty doo I can starve while my partner is eating . Woooo . But wait ...there's more ... Animals : The smaller animals are too hard to hit . It might take you 10 pistol bullets just to shoot one small animal . And then , there 's the next story about an animal ... The first time I played Rise on XBOX , the aiming was so bad that I ran out of ammo by the time I was up against that first bear . Guess what ? I had to melee that S .O.B. to death and wait to heal because there were no resources and no bloody freaking ammo . I gave up on Rise for 1 year and bought the stupid game again on pc .

WOW this game blew me away ! It really does feel like a Japanese Arcade Shmup . The eerie midieval fantasy theme is really cool . Yes the background noise is a little creepy , but its very authentic . Everything about this game is really good , graphics , sounds , music , enemies , levels , controls (Xinput+Dinput) etc . Also there is an alternate version , MUGEN VRITRA and unlockables , hence the " complete edition " . If you love shmups , this is definitely a must have , so far easily the best shmup for 2018 for me . You get so much game for so little money , very impressive ! To PC standards this is a relatively short game , but as an arcade shmup fan , this is the bees knees . Very nice balance of arcade shooter and traditional bullet hell , very nice to see . Highly recommended ! ps . ultrawide monitor support also
666,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pikalenni95/recommended/787340,pikalenni95,787340,Expansion packs , DLC 's, updates , whatever you would like to call them , are a great excuse to let the developers support their already well-made game in the core and experiment with entirely new concepts , ideas , or even characters , and this DLC for the fantastic video game A Hat in Time is no exception . Experiments are a hit or miss , and this is how I feel about this DLC . Some parts of this DLC are so good it 's almost criminal , and other parts shove the frustration part down so much that at one point I had to take a break . But let 's get over it , shall we ? Chapter 6 , The Arctic Cruise and the main meat of the tofu sandwich is without a doubt , the best addition that this game got so far . All 3 Acts offer something unique and are way more juicy in content + length , which comes at a small cost , which I get into later . Act 1 is such a well-done introduction where you can get to know the layout of the ship better , toy around with your gadgets much like in Mafia Town Act 1 , and the Captain is such a loveable goofball . The voice cast for every new addition was well thought out , and the performance is excellent . Overall , a good - no , great - tutorial for something new . Act 2 , and this is where problems start to rise , is Ship Shape . Your job is to take on multitasking by basically picking an object up and delivering it to its intended destination . When doing such multitasking , I was expecting to find the optimal route to keep the Captains sanity as low as possible - but instead , those objectives get randomised , which are an inconsistency of the rules for this challenge . You may get 3 in one handy spot ; you may get three scattered around the entire ship . The game tries to GPS you in the right direction , which doesn 't always work and is wonky . You are best off memorising the map of the ship . At least , I thought that I had to pick multiple things to keep up with the pace , which is possible . However , the game punishes you by hindering your movement a little bit . That addition was fine , although some smaller parts of the ship became incredibly tedious to manoeuvre in . In conclusion , a not-so-spicy Act thanks to the inconsistency of the rules around it . Act 3 , was a little bit short but a nice twist to keep things interesting . I sadly ran into one bug here , which was my fault . The hindering movement part for carrying too many things was executed here way better , as you would take damage by icing water or other hazards , rather than lose precious time . You had to use your brain a little bit and construct a plan on how much you wanted to carry , as carrying too much would put you in danger , which is , in my opinion , a way better high-risk high-reward mechanic . I have not tried much of the Co-op , but it seems to work as intended . Now , the main reason why so many people got frustrated over this DLC was / is the Death Wish mode . It was incredibly hard for me how to judge this mode in its fairness , that 's why I want to stay neutral and say that The Death Wish mode is a well-needed addition to the game , although it needs lots of monitoring over the next few weeks . GFB stated themselves that Death Wish is " exceptionally , brutally difficult " , so it was important for me to include this into the judgement Death Wish is essentially taking already existing Acts and giving them a spicier flavour , setting your {?} on fire for maximum torture . The idea behind this is so genius , it allows the player to get involved in a simple , challenging obstacle . The Snatcher keeps picking you for that extra annoyance , which refines his character a lot . I did a few of them , and I love the idea behind it , and GFB nailed on how hard it can get , but the execution needs refinements . Here 's why : -Death Wish has inconsistency in difficulty spikes . A lot of these challenges are tweaked in difficulty so much ; it is a mess of spaghetti . -The life system in a rouge- " like " this is a BIG no ! By failing too often , you get locked out of the level and have to wait a few minutes before retrying . This system is bonkers and the main reason I avoid this mode so much . It isn 't fun having to wait those minutes ; it 's just punishing and frustrating . -Easy Mode destroys the intent of the developers , and it is with 10 Pons even {?} easy to get . It used to be Yarn which was way more shifted to the developers intend , making it a risky choice . Death Wish is a considerable risk that GFB took , and I love it , although it 's so controversial that I am interested to see where this mode - and the opinion of the players - go within the next few weeks . In total Conclusion is Seal the Deal an exciting addition with many risks , which don 't work at times . I am still glad this risk was taken .

Things go wrong , you can miss a crucial blow , you can die of bleeding or get stressed out at the worst possible time , and even experienced players can find themselves fleeing from a dungeon run that quickly gone south . Some people say it 's bad design , some people say it adds to the experience , I can say it really adds to the tension without feeling unfair , and the game would lose its edge without the constant reminder that overconfidence is a slow and insidiuous killer and you can never underestimate this game , but it gives you the option to turn off some of the mechanics if you wish . Fortunately , you can flee at any time during the run and fights , and you quickly learn that running away with your haul and your life is also part of the game . Overall just a fun , brutal experience that 's not for everyone , but one of the best dungeon crawlers out there .

Hoo-boy ...get the razor blades ready , kids ... Basically , it 's a domestic drama in the form of a point-and-click game . And it 's not an entirely BAD point-and-click game , but not an especially inspired one either . Visually and aurally the game is decent , and it 's certainly easy to argue that somewhat robotic-looking people with fixed facial expressions can be a " style " . The same argument cannot , unfortunately , be made for dialogue as stilted as : " How are you , Andrew ?" " I am hungry , mom . Give me something to eat , please ." Not quite Tennessee Williams . Neither is the story , which is heavy-handed and melodramatic to say the least ; even if I can 't help but award points for the sheer , stubborn bleakness of it all . The puzzles aren 't exactly " fun " either , unless you like meticulously poring over a screen looking for rows of numbers that add up to another number (people who are even worse at maths than Yours Truly : you have been warned ). And I won 't even attempt to describe the sheer insane " logic " of the cat / photograph / cigarette puzzle ...you'll just have to play to find out for yourself ! I sincerely hope that the lives of real-life Russians and Ukrainians aren 't as profoundly hopeless as indie games so frequently depict them as being . Apparently these people can 't even cross a road safely without having to rewire the traffic lights first ! It 's almost enough to coax me into mail-ordering a bride , just to spare her a life of utter f *cking misery . A passable game , if only barely ...unless you 're the type who thinks that " stories " like this actually reflect reality , and / or are a lover of puzzles so obscure that even Sherlock Holmes would laugh and shake his head as he finally lucks upon the solution .

677,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sengtsan/recommended/235210,sengtsan,235210,I had a lot of fun with Strider . At first I was not impressed . The platforming controls felt imprecise and beating the early batch of enemies involved pure button mashing . The art style was unique but not mindblowing , and the music was par for the course for this sort of game . Meh . BUT , I gave it it chance , and I 'm glad I did , because as progress was made : the environments became more expansive , inviting exploration ; a host of powers and upgrades become available , making combat more varied ; and the enemies and platforming amped up in difficulty , which made the whole thing far more interesting . In short , I had to scratch beneath the surface to get to the good stuff . Good stuff it is , but not mindblowingly good . It does what it sets out to do nonetheless ; it 's a great platformer that 's pretty addictive , challenging in places , but always forgiving in the number of tries you can have . Also , the japanese anime and arcade sensibilities are well executed too if you like that sort of thing . Give it a whirl . I never played the original Strider so can 't compare , but this game stands strong in it 's own right .
678,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SimplyForest/recommended/511740,SimplyForest,511740,I liked this game , A lot . I had a lot of fun playing and wanted to play it way more than I could . Unfortunately for me I was met with crash after crash , with many story points I was unable to pass simply because it would trigger a crash . I was cut short in my experience . I waited a long time to see if it would be patched to fix the crash issues , but it never happened . I really wanted to enjoy this game . It is not a bad game gameplay wise , however technically , it is a horrible game . Do not buy the port , it is a waste of your time .

684,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Finchie-Poo/recommended/242760,Finchie-Poo,242760,The Forest is a game that starts with a compelling air of fog-ridden ambiguity as you wander your way through an expansive , seemingly-isolated island riddled with caves and makeshift-villages -- caves and villages that , from the late 19th to early 20th century onward , were once inhabited by survivors that were just as lost and desperate as you are . You 're one of the (potentially) few survivors of a plane crash who 's searching for a son stolen by a strange man covered in red paint . ...and, well , from there the game goes on with a Lovecraftian-esque descent into absurdity as signs of foul play unearth themselves through nondescript environmental storytelling , all of which involve horrors that I feel are too surreal to spoil . It 's a game full of many monstrous discoveries that , at worst , are locked behind an hour or two of slow-paced spelunking and metroidvania-style progression systems . But in the end , I felt pretty damn good about my time spent in The Forest . Just make sure to bring a friend and a few barf bags .
685,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lightspeedtooslow/recommended/290530,lightspeedtooslow,290530,Finished the game as the Agent with my friend being the Hacker , and I have to say between the two of us , this game has phenomenal gameplay . Visually the game looks like {?} but how good the gameplay is completely makes up for it . The Agent and the Hacker rely heavily on each other to get through each mission and there 's several different ways you can tackle it . The story wasn 't all too great , but the gameplay is just so good , we were able to look past it . It was definetly one of the funnest games I 've played and would love to go through again a few times exploring the various ways you can play through this game . I fully reccommend this game
686,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sid1120/recommended/289070,sid1120,289070,I will admit : I initially down-voted this game . I have played more than my share of Civ5 and I initially found it very hard to find anything compelling about this game : the visuals are much harder to understand , the tech-tree looks sparse , the UI and camera work are a step-back and the barbarians can be real jerks on newcomers (20 turns in , whoop-di-whoop , a whole army is at your door and they 're not just passing by ). That said , I gave it another few times and I just finally got around completing a first game . Oh boy , it 's very different and in a great way . Where Civ5 used to be a bothersome micro of needless stacks of workers min / maxing tiny details on a map , Civ 6 stands on it 's own by providing an intricate system of quests and complex urban planning . Once you get the initial struggles of enjoying your first attempts , your first complete game provides an easy glance of everything the game has to offer (I played Prince , usually I 'm at Emperor on Civ5 ), with a feeling that you now know all that you need to become an epic urban / civilization planner on your next game . NOTE : I thought my 1st complete game was easy , but I also stumbled on my neighbor 's settler early game and went crazy from there on , cruching him and blocking the remaining neighbor out of 3/4 of the continent . Overview : - Great , but hard to get into at first . EDIT , FOLLOWING 2nd GAME : A ) The Civ century-old problem still persists : You know you 've won and nothing can change that fact , but you still have to buckle up for 6 hours of final , boring end-game . B ) I haven 't played with the new expansion , so maybe the statement above changed . C ) The AI seems more moronic than ever . They never attack you , even if you 're at war . They just stack their entire territory with units and wait to get obliterated by archers . Even if they DO decide to attack you , they make a point of spreading their attacks so each of units are left with a little HP but never dead . It 's still a great , very different game . But a lot of the old Civ problems go unresolved . And honnestly , I don 't think they can fix them , because programming an AI with neural networks able to understand all of the complexities of this new system would be worthy of a nobel prise or some highly-regarded academic paper .

691,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rexmonocle/recommended/440,rexmonocle,440,Take a look at how many hours I 've put into it . That should tell you how much I like the game , right ?
692,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/caleblives/recommended/865670,caleblives,865670,This is easily the greatest DLC of the year . It 's got Mostly positive / mixed less because of what 's in the game rather than the fact that it 's not going to be for everyone . It 's part story DLC , part new map and challenge , part roguelike aspects , and something entirely new thrown in there . I won 't say it 's flawless , getting to the end only to have to start from the beginning sucks , and there 's some balancing things that if you prod you could probably exploit , but I 'm not talking about that , i 'm talking about Mooncrash at it 's best . Mooncrash is at its best when it 's forcing you into difficult , unpredictable situations under a time limit . You are split across five characters you unlock gradually , all with their own individual skillset , none of whom ever becomes a do-it-all tank like Alex Yu does . This , plus the unpredictable nature of enemies , resources , and Prey 's design allowing for you to break it , creates a deeply interesting and genuinely immersive experience . It 's far more dangerous than Prey 1 ever was , and never feels truly easy . You can 't just load an old save and reset if you make a bad choice , you 're forced to STICK with your decisions and use every tool in your toolbox to make it out alive / in time , at least until the simulation resets . Everything works on it 's own ruleset and there 's 2-3 ways to do anything , which combined with these new aspects , creates an experience that starts out frighteningly difficult , and becomes gradually easier as you learn the systems . The game CAN screw you over occasionally , but the setback is still , never permanent . You always get another chance to do it again , collect any points once you do it again . Little stuff like realizing I can disable mimic gates with an EMP grenade , or use the Bowcaster to lure the land shark fundamentally changed how I played the game , opening up new shortcuts , new routes to certain items or areas .... There 's so many great ideas at work here that it 's very easy to forgive some of the ones they clearly didn 't have time to polish to a mirror sheen . It 's more Prey , and some of it 's even better than the main game like giving the mimics more texture to their forms , new enemy types and variants , and it 's a Prey that keeps changing and getting better . No , it 's not for everyone but if you enjoy Arkane 's Games and enjoyed Prey you owe it to yourself to give it a try to see if it 's the kind of thing you 'd be into , because if you do , chances are you 'll get sucked in . I just REALLY , REALLY want to see more games like this , this is absolutely brilliant .

The soundtrack was pretty good ,using Sufjan Stevens as the main catalyst for the theme / music is just wonderful and a + to me since his music is really good and amazing , an artist that probably should get more attention than other musicians as of late and the game is as subtle as it gets , there were a few easter eggs about Blackwell Academy and Mark Jefferson (That bastard ). ------------ TL ;DR, It 's a good game . Get it , it 's totally free . ------------ P .S. Using the song " Death with Dignity " is a really good choice on the developers , it really gives another meaning to Chris ' childhood situation and the death of his mom and the way he copes with it . ------------ P .S.S, Will Max be in LiS 2 ? Answer me Dontnod Entertainment .
702,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ABCali/recommended/258180,ABCali,258180,I don 't know what other people were expecting in the end but it is a good small / simplified game that is converted from mobile origin . It is Deus Ex to the end of its roots . Only downsides of it is having some little bugs and unfinished storyline (probably won 't be done after Mankind Divided 's financial failure ). But if you ignore these parts , it is Deus Ex to its core . You can find a lot different solutions for the quests which you can 't find in most of the RPG titles out there . It 's highly enjoyable and for me , it is meant to be played in a stealthy way . It just lasted 5 hour or so . Really , grab this when it is on sale if you are DX fan . I 'll be playing DX : IW after this . That game also is ba *tardized by DX community due to its simplification and engine problems . Probably that game will turn out to be a good DX game also .

And sorry to say , this game is nowhere near to be the lovely Artifex Mundi magic , which made me a die-hard fan . I might finish this , because I bought it . And to get some achievements . And because it is ok in a so-so way . Would I have fallen in love with Hidden Object games , if this was my first game in that genre ? Nope . I would probably have kept away forever . Because it is boring . Story is boring , and there is nothing new . Too many hidden object scenes , which do not fit in , do not make sense , and same old - same old . I am supposed to save a bunch of children from the evil puppet-master , but the story is so bad , I am unable to even care . Scary scenes ? Nah . None . Need to know what happens next ? No . So why play through ? I am a die-hard fan , - that 's probably why . And mentioning that : - Artifex Mundi IS making a lovely new game - mainly Grim Legends 3 , The Dark City . I was lucky to play the Beta , and I can tell you all : Don 't waste your money on The Puppet Thief , - Buy Grim Legend 1 , 2 - and wait for 3 ; Those games are brilliant , and makes you fall in love :))) And please , Artifex Mundi - make some new interesting achievements to reach - add the parabels and hidden stuff to find , and make your games look new ? And do not take away the colors , like you did in The Puppet Thief :(

It felt like I tried way too many times before I reached the targets properly . But the moves felt so smooth , the graphisms and sounds so realistic that I actually began to love this game . I managed to kill some people and realized it wasn 't that difficult to succeed to do so , afterall . You got different squads and classes of riflemen and experts . The maps are various and playing for several rounds in the same area doesn 't even feel like a routine . If you were hesitating to buy it , don 't doubt anymore . Go for it . 10/10 would buy again .

714,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MarkDarkness/recommended/341870,MarkDarkness,341870,This game is what it is and should be judged as such : a somewhat hard and a bit short action-plarformer where you play as a badass elephant that rampages his way around stages . Every stage has secrets and collectibles , but since often you cannot backtrack , clearly the emphasis is on moving forward , and that it does quite well . Yeah , the controls aren 't absurdly tight , but they are good , easily better than most Sonic games out there . What really stands out are the little story vignettes featuring this valiant pachyderm and the general he served with during a past war ; incredible stuff , both funny and inspiring . Overall , go in with your expectations set to " low " and you won 't regret it .

Although it doesn 't stray too far from the two previous titles , it offers some decent challenges and has a great presentation . The puzzles feel familiar yet are intricate and often have that 'wow' factor that just tickles me the right way . Overall the difficulty level is quite low (I'd recommend turning hints " off " to get the most out of it ) but the pacing and variety feels just about right . I especially liked the gloomy atmosphere and the Lovecraftian overtones (although they are very subtle ). Sure , The Room 3 doesn 't meet the grandiose scope of classics like Obduction or XING : The Land Beyond but to compare it with those games is beside the point . This is a much smaller and shorter game but then again for this price The Room 3 solidly delivers with a good few hours of great fun ! I was quite satisfied after completing it in about 6 hours , but if you 're not opposed to investing some more time it even offers multiple endings , extra puzzles and a grander mystery to solve . Good stuff ! 7.5/10
718,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Anzyll/recommended/268910,Anzyll,268910,It runs everything perfectly , but the final boss . Mega cucked .
719,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ThreeSon/recommended/611690,ThreeSon,611690,This is a perfect example of a game that was not properly playtested . Of course there are plenty of junk games on Steam that have that problem , but Invicta Beam is not a junk game - there was clearly a lot of effort made by the developer here , as seen in the nice visuals and overall level of polish . But it 's a giant pain to play . For a quick demonstration of why , watch this brief clip (not my video ) from the final room of the very first non-tutorial level of the game (skip to 7 :41 if your browser doesn 't do it for you ): <url> Note that the player in that video enters the room with 3 lives at full health and finishes with 1 life remaining (the health bar is in the upper-left corner ). Did you spot the moments where they take damage ? In this game your health just seems to suddenly drop with no audio or visual indication of what is happening , other than a little " beep " when you lose a life . This lack of feedback is the #1 problem . So how are they being damaged ? The first bit of health gets taken off from the green turrets that pop up early . It looks like the turrets are just sitting there doing nothing , but they are actually firing from a little machine gun near the top . The bullets are invisible and seemingly impossible to avoid . The next chunk of damage comes from the rockets being fired by the blue turrets towards the end of the clip . They are definitely making contact since the health bar is dropping , but on-screen the rockets look like they are either passing right through the player , circling around them , or flying into the walls , again with no feedback for any of it . Another problem shown In that clip - The player has a secondary rocket launcher weapon that they fire numerous times . Half the time the rocket reaches the target , while the rest of the time the rockets immediately blow up in their face . Why does that happen ? I have no idea . It was constantly happening to me also , which makes the rocket launcher useless (the other secondary weapon is a shield , which also suffers a lack of feedback on whether it is working or not ). This is all just in the first level . I only made it to the end of the second level , after dying about 20 times in just 30 minutes of playing , before giving up . The problems got much worse in a very short amount of time . I think it 's great that the developer provided a demo , but you probably won 't need it - You will know well before the 2 hour mark whether or not you will enjoy the rest of the game . I requested a refund , but I will keep following it to see if any additional gameplay updates are made .

I found many similarities to my favorite Binding of Isaac (and BOI : Rebirth too ) but Risk of Rain provides the fun in a more aggressive way , more hardcore , if you say so . Two things I 've been remembering all way through my humble time of playing (this will be fixed soon ) are Terraria , from which Risk of Rain took some details and mechanics , and Rogue Legacy , which also has this extreme hardcore feeling , but lacks the flexibility . Guys did amazing job getting all the best together and Risk of Rain is a beautiful product , but pretty hardcore-ey - easy mode does not count any progress you made and is simply boring while normal mode goes way up so be prepared to have a tough start . Game is flexible and it requires you to be flexible as well . Do or die . 8/10 will play more Bugs make some experience horrible .

741,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bubblebutt8/recommended/200210,bubblebutt8,200210,This game , is some what good , but it seems like an iphone game . I mean the graphicsare pixalated which seems lazy , but I guess that 's the artstyle , so cant really complain . the game is a beta , or something like that , and ALOT of things are missing , like HOW THE {?} AM I SUPPOSED TO BEAT A DUNGEON WHEN IT 'S NOT COMPLETE !?!?!?! {?} !?!?! {?} !?!?!? THIS IS THE ONE OTHER DUNGEON THEY CAME UP WITH AND I CAN 'T DO JACK {?} !!!! There is little to no gameplay PLUS it shows lag WITH NO SIGNS other than when your character dosen 't respond . the game can 't pause , which is annoying when you try to put items down , which sometimes glitches where the item so it {?} ing stays in the middle of the screen where you can 't pick it up , and the WORST part about it is that free to play license . IT TOOK ME 99 MINUTES TO EARN A PIECE , ONE {?} ING PIECE OF GOLD , so you have to buy anything you want unless it 's a class which can be earned by grinding little guys or an easy boss . there are {?} tons of more reasons but , that would take WAY too long to write up . don 't play unless you have nothing better to do or it gets 20 more updates that aren 't just rare pets , keys , or {?} that dosen 't matter to actual gameplay .

Check out some good screenshots ! <url> <url> <url>

750,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rmgh/recommended/255710,rmgh,255710,Cities : Skylines on its own is a very solid game . Everything I loved about SimCity 4 , but better . Larger surface area to build to , more extensible , and a good price point . But the real key is in the mods . The mods can let you go from making relatively large towns to megacities . They can improve the sometimes questionable vehicle AI , and allow you to fine-tune the game to your liking . If your PC can handle it , you can creat an entire region , with a central city and suburbs and towns , all interconnected by road , rail , or metro . Great Game ++

756,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ivanleterrible/recommended/287700,ivanleterrible,287700,Simply one of the best games I 've played in my life ! First of all , this is the first Metal Gear game that I have played , so don 't expect me to compare it to other Metal Gear games . Second , for me gameplay is more important than story , so this is why I think this game is great : cause it has simply the best stealth / action 3rd person gameplay ever made Story In this game , you are the mercenary legend Snake . You wake in hospital after a long come just to find out that your precious motherbase was destroyed . Then , you team up with your buddies Oceletot and Miller and try to rebuild Motherbase and puersue your dream of creating an army without borders . Along the missions you will also find out clues on who tried to kill you and destroy your base . You will meet up with interesting NPCs , like the sniper Quiet and the treacherous Skull Unit . Now , I saw some people complaining that there is very little story on this game and so on ... Well , I have to disagree . The long cutscenes are there , but they are split among the 50 missions , so to see the big picture you have to finish the entire game , instead of doing just the first missions , like most people do . The story is good and makes sense even though it has some exaggerated anime-esque stuff . Just the ending is kinda of dissappointing , like really bad ... Gameplay Now , the gameplay is what makes this game amazing : you press the button to shoot and Snake shots , you press the button to run and Snake runs immediately . It might sound dumb , but it 's really impressive how responsive and precise the controls are in this game . The actions are fast and quick , with no winding up moves , unlike other games . Also , every time you are performing an action , like reloading , you can immediatelly interrupt that action with a defensive one , like running or taking cover . It 's a really impressive work on what the devs have done with this game 's controls . Also , bear in mind that even if the game rellies heavely on stealth , you can also try other approaches to completing missions . You can even go Rambo with heavy weapons and heavy armor . I mostly played the sniper approach , taking down enemies from a distance , it kinda of worked for me Motherbase management Now this is a game inside a game . To build the new motherbase is kinda of a strategy game by itself , and it 's highly addictive ! You need to find resourses like oil and metal to build base platforms , then you have to recruit men to work for you , then you can build stuff like new weapons or security items ... The possibilities are nearly endless in how to improve and what to build for your motherbase . I give it 5.0/5.0 <url>

766,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/37700,stumpo,37700,This is an incredibly low budget time travel FPS game . If you 're looking for polished setpieces , you won 't find them here . But if you 're looking for using cluster bombs on civil war battlefields to mess with history , this is your game . One mission (sorry for the mild spoiler here , but it 'll help sell you on the game ) involves you getting put in a POW camp , being broken out by a mysterious stranger ... and then traveling back in time and being the mysterious strange who breaks yourself out of the POW camp . It 's so absurd , but it 's awesome . The part where future soldiers with automatic weapons show up at the eruption of Mt . Vesuvius is totally campy . The one rule of the game is that you can 't mess with history ... until the game tells you to mess with history . If you 're in the mood for something that 's very clunky with a lot of heart , I think you 'll enjoy making your way through the game . It 's a pity that surface-level complaints about the game caused reviews to miss how enjoyable it is .

770,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ConvictioNDR/recommended/696790,ConvictioNDR,696790,I cannot stand the historical inaccuracy of this game . And I 'm not talking about the black female Nazis that are scared of the Swastika . I 'm talking about the fact that Sledgehammer has made war to look like a game . Like you go into team deathmatch and it 's keeping score and you just stop battling once the score limit is reached then you do it again next match . This isn 't historically accurate at all . And then there is some other mode where there are giant red or blue dog tags that seemingly appear from nowhere when a soldier falls in battle . When did this happen in World War 2 ? I don 't remember learning this in history . And someone please explain how hardpoint works ? There are these red and blue hologram borders projected around an area with no real tactical significance on the battlefield . This area that is supposed to be significant literally has nothing of value in it . No ammo dumps or anything . The soldiers are sent to fight and die for 30 seconds before their commanders get bored and send them to another insignifcant area on the battlefield to die . Such a waste of lives . And wow , the guns . They put attachments on the guns that never existed for that gun . How dare Sledgehammer games try to add more variety and fun to this arcade shooter . When I think of Call of Duty , I think of this real war simulator that I could take to a University and teach students history in a fun way where they get to shoot at eachother without the cops getting called , but I 'm truly disappointed in the end product . If Sledgehammer can 't make COD realistic again then they should have stuck to the flying people of the future ...

This game could 've easily been released during the SNES era , mainly because of the graphics and the BGM .

The store-page describes this game very well : " Legend of Grimrock 2 is a dungeon crawling role playing game with a modern execution but an oldschool heart ." That 's it : it 's and old school CRPG infused with modern technology . It 's a pretty cool game , very well done , bug free , and it lasts for about 30 hours , which is awesome . Legend of Grimrock 2 was also [essentially] made by a group of 6 people or so , and that 's really impressive too . There 's one thing that may take the player unaware , though : this game contains a lot of puzzles and secrets . These are mostly fair and usually very rewarding , but some things are really difficult to figure out , and there 's like a 98% chance you 'll have to resort do Google at one point or another .... or , most likely , several times , if leaving stones unturned bothers you like it does me . The only thing I 'd say they really screwed up is that right at the beginning of the game , about 1 hour in , there 's a good chance you 'll get stuck like I , and many others , did -- in your very " First Challenge " (as the game itself puts it ). I think it 's the only part in the entire game that you may get stuck at and cannot proceed without solving it . Afterwards , only optional secrets / puzzles will be a problem . Just keep in mind that , sometimes , you have to explore other areas to find what you need , so ... if you also get stuck at the " First Challenge ," just make sure you 've checked every place you can . Once you find what you need to proceed , everything will be obvious . The combat is actually something that is also ... weird . You gotta right-click on your characters ' weapons , individually , to attack . If you want to use a potion , or something else that is not currently in their hands (and it won 't be ) you have to open your inventory and use it from there . It 's really uncomfortable . But before this sets you off , remember that the game is otherwise so good that , in the end , it doesn 't really matter so much . It 's weird , yeah , but not game-breaking . Now I 'm gonna say something about the items you 'll find throughout the game and party formation . Some may consider this a spoiler , so I 'll black it out , but the point is just to help you decide what party to make : There are two good Heavy Armor sets in the game ; just one so-so Light Armor set ; one set of wizard robes . You 'll find 3 good Heavy Weapons ; about 5 decent Light ones ; not a single acceptable Staff / Rod for melee-striking ; only " meh " Missile Weapons ; good Firearms . Eventually , you 'll also find two amulets that give the wearing character +25% experience . If I were to play Legends of Grimrock 2 again , knowing what I do now , after beating it , I 'd go with the following party : Only humans , because of the extra experience they get . Two Battle-Mages up front , with heavy weapons and heavy armor , because of the class trait and the Shield Spell (for melee combat , not for actual spellcasting . I 'm not totally sure there 's enough Skill Points available to make this work 100% , though ); A Wizard (for actual spellcasting ); and an Alchemist , because of the extra ingredients he gets , but with missile weapons instead of firearms (even though these are good ) because there 's not enough ammo to use firearms all the time . Still regarding party-formation , I believe this is something everyone should know : you really should have an Alchemist (not neccessarily the class , but at the very least one character with the skill , level 4 ) and at least one Wizard / Battle Mage , but mainly for the Light spell , so you don 't have to keep carrying torches around . Neither is strictly neccessary to beat the game , but you 'll have a much harder time without them . Actually , there 's one part , in one Dungeon , that I have no idea how I would have gotten through if I didn 't use a certain spell . You should also know that Firearms ' ammo is limited , while Missile Weapons themselves , or the arrows / bolts they use , are recoverable and , thus , infinite . And also that weight-carrying capacities will eventually become a nuisance , unless [and even if ] you have 2 Minotaurs in your party , like I did . And that at some point during mid-game food will also become scarce (although before and after that it 's fine ) so be careful with those Minotaurs if you choose them . Oh ! and most importantly : 95% of the time only your two first-row characters will get hit . The other two will only get struck (as a rule ) by spells or flanking attacks (unless you deliberately decide to wave your sexy behind at the enemy ). Damn , there 's one more thing : do not go " Save-on-crystals-only mode " in your first playthtrough , and I advise against doing it on Hard even . In this game , these are mainly for masochists and / or people who already know very well what they 're doing (A.K.A. " people who have already finished the game " ). So ... summing up : Legend of Grimrock 2 is really well done , with interesting puzzles and secrets , and it lasts for a pretty good while , remaining interesting up until the very end . Having to click on your characters ' portraits / weapons to attack makes combat somewhat weird , and the very " First Challenge " may get you stumped for a while , but just overlook that and play this , because it 's a great game .
794,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Svarozhic/recommended/447820,Svarozhic,447820,I felt a WW2 itch and felt like I needed to get me a good World War 2 game . The market at the moment is pretty weak , or very specific . I decided to buy Day of Infamy because to me it seemed like it would fulfill all my wishes ... And boyyyy did it . Day of Infamy is made by the same devs that made Insurgency , however it is not a reskin of Insurgency as many people think . For example I didn 't enjoy Insurgency and could never understand the fuss around this , but since I bought Day of Infamy I 've been playing it consistently every day . The gunplay of Day of Infamy reminds me of Insurgency , and the engine . But the rest doesn 't.. I will list some pros and cons according to my experience and opinion .. Pros : - Teamwork based game . You cannot win individually . - Historically accurate uniforms , weaponry etc .. - Great graphics for a Source engine game . - Hardcore / Tactical to a certain degree . - Brings back memories of early WW2 FPS games (Omaha, Foy , Bastonge etc ..) - Good community of people that are helpful . - Has a wonderful workshop . Cons : - Air support / air strike system is a bit too OP on certain maps - How well you do is highly dependant on map knowledge - Censored swastikas , SS symbols etc So you might think that there 's not enough cons here or that I 'm biased . but this is really how I perceive the game . I think that at the moment the game is quite polished and that there are no more cons than I 've listed . However everyone has their opinion . Day of Infamy mixes the modern fps and classic fps really well . I felt that it was just the right amount of hardcore and tactical . The game offers a proximity based VOIP system that isn 't team restricted which is an interesting function . (The enemy can hear you talk in proximity too ). All in all I recommend Day of Infamy . For the price it has currently , the amount of content you get (+ the workshop ) is a more than fair deal .

YOU CAN 'T!!!!! You can spend hours looking for a gun or weapon and find one , just to get {?} ing killed by a zombie as soon as you come back , plus , the game just feels lazy , placing zombies all around each house , and each zombie WILL take 50% of your god damn health if you dont have a weapon of some sort , and hey , if you didn 't find ome sort of weapon , they should all be in a house , cause ya know military bases are not enterable at all . Literally I found a bunch of weapons , left the game , joined the next day , and a crawler was in the same house , though I thought he was outside , then I die , losing the guns I spent {?} ing forever trying to find . the guy who made this should make zombies spawn outside of the house or shouldn 't spawn at least 20 feet away , so you aren 't {?} ing killed at the start of an old game . also , lower the {?} ing sights of the zombies , and speed , cause if one zombie sees you , many do , and there is no way to outrun them . you could run for hours , and they would still be on your {?} unless you kill the one , or 5 of the ones following you . I honestly could recommend this game even if it 's only the spawn killing zombies that are edited out , but right now , all I can say is {?} THIS GAME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but , he still updates it plus , you would have to give him props for making it this far . is good . goodnight .

Every story has its canvas , synopsis , contents , key moments , prologue and epilogue . And there is no book that re-reading it would not reveal new details that you hadn 't noticed before . But every book has a last page . And after turning it over , we put the book on the shelf . Just to open a new one tomorrow ... I can 't express how much i love Everlasting Summer . When i 'm looking for a visual novel , i 'm mostly interested in it 's story , like reading a good book . And this one is indeed became one of my favourites ... Okay , i 'll start with the cons , let 's get this over with , there is a really few . The drawings at some places are interesting , and not in a good way . It 's not that bad , but characters can totally end up differently in one or two scenes . Maybe Semyon , our protagonist is a little more awkward than he should and monologises too much sometimes . But none of these " cons " take away from this beautiful game ! It is the story that you want to happen to you , but sadly , it never will . An experience that can shake up your life , and can change you for (hopefully) good . Each ending is different , each will leave you with a different emotion . Don 't want to spoil much here , so just play it through . The atmosphere is great , and the music ... Oh my god , i 'm going to listen these soundtracks until the end of times . These songs are beautiful , full of emotions . I know probably that this review is not stating propely why is it a must have game , but i would have to spoil everything in order to make you understand . But then again , there 's the game , and it 's also free , so why don 't you experience it yourself ?

The story follows young Sara as she leaves her father in India to become a " proper English girl " at a school in London . There are ups and most certainly downs along the way . The common route is all about Sara , but the individual routes focus on the different girls / women that Sara meets while there and the relationships that develop . If you 're looking for deep yuri , this isn 't it . While there are 6 routes you can take , only a few focus more on the romance side ; the rest tend to be about familial love and bonds that form between the girls . While I whole-heartedly recommend this VN , I wasn 't a fan of the " gameplay " where you must accumulate specific stats to reveal individual scenes with your chosen girl (s). It all felt a bit random and unecessary . I can understand the point in doing so , but if I became " blocked " due to bad luck with the RNG , I felt compelled to save scum and reload until I got what I needed . Also , the " payoff " felt more satisfying in certain routes ; but that could simply be because I felt more personally attached to those characters . All-in-all , time well spent , and for once I ACTUALLY read all 6 routes . Well , I skimmed Lottie a little .

Most of the annoying things seems to have been fixed but there are still aspects that could really do with a proper Beta-player (or several ). It 's once again playable , though I 'm not changing my " thumb down " for this game . For a long while it was bugged right from the start (see my original review ) but the various triggers seem to trigger now and I 'm pretty sure there are no broken achievements . The good things mentioned in my original review are still good . But ! You still don 't have any idea what to do since there are very few clues in where to go and who to talk to (there's a video walkthrough for an earlier version without an ending but at least it 's somewhat helpful ). It 's very easy to miss triggers that " open " up more of the game because at least one of them need you to walk over a certain area and another to read a sign . Yeah . ----------- ORIGINAL REVIEW This is a crappy , broken and most likely abandoned game . Unfortunately . I started playing it in July 2016 but took a break from it (luckily after getting the chicken achievement ) because it was very clearly an Early Access game , despite being sold / advertised as a full / finished game . I wanted to wait until they had added features like NPCs , items , chests , quests etc . You know , normal things you should be able to experience in a game . I was also annoyed with all the design flaws like walking on trees and being blocked by grass . Some things are now fixed , but most are still badly designed with blocked off areas and invisible doors . Good thing : they 've added NPCs , items , chests , quests and fixed some bad designs / layouts and unkillable monsters . Bad thing : they broke the game with the (probably) latest update / fix sometime late last year . If you 're a new player starting a new game , you won 't be leaving the first village because a main quest trigger won 't be triggered in the first chapter 's very beginning . Game Over . Result : 2/8 achievements . If you 're like me , continuing a saved game from outside the first village in the first chapter will take you all the way to the second chapter 's very beginning where , once again , a main quest trigger won 't be triggered . Game Over . Result : 6/8 achievements or , if you got the Chicken Rancher achievement before the " fix " , 7/8 achievements .

The game 's combat system suffers from sluggish combat & no player invincibility frames which would usually be in other games . The game 's story progression is like this . Chapter 1 = Steady , Chapter 2 = Steady , Chapter 3 = Slow , Chapter 4 = Steady , Chapter 5 = Fast . I love this game though there were a few bumps in chapter 3 & chapter 5 disappointed me greatly by its length & generic Beast Bendy . If you love horror games with elements of combat mixed it , play this .

832,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991792596/recommended/570,76561197991792596,570,I have a hard time understanding the enormous popularity of this game . Like many other team based games , I 'm sure it can be rewarding to play competitively together with friends , but I don 't get why it has to be so horribly punishing . A few mistakes can easily lead to a hopeless situation for a player , from which no comeback is possible . The nature of the game is such that you cannot leave the game before the end with your honour intact , so all you can do is wait it out and try not to die more than absolutely necessary . Since there are 100 + heroes to choose from and loads of items too buy , and since you pretty much have to understand what every hero and item can do , the learning curve is horrible . It 's not easy being a new player . The gameplay mechanics are partially counter-intuitive , especially when it concerns last-hitting . Unlike other games , you 're usually not supposed to kill npc enemies as quickly as possible . Quite the opposite . Most of the time , you 're trying to do as little damage as possible and only strike an already wounded npc when you can get the kill . Between kill opportunities , you 're just waiting around , trying to avoid damage , and if you get the chance to kill an npc from your own team , you 're supposed to do it , to avoid letting an enemy player kill it . It 's a very weird mechanic , which feels very " gamey " and doesn 't fit the theme at all , as I understand it . What definitely kills it for me is all the waiting . I don 't approve of the waiting while being dead . There should be better game mechanics for punishing failure than to force the player to sit around and wait . But that 's not the worst waiting . It 's the matchmaking that 's the worst part . Getting ten players ready to play can take quite some time . I 'm sure it 's quicker if you join as a team , but if you 're not part of one , you sometimes have to endure many failed attempts before a game can finally start . Personally , I like the playing part of games much better than the waiting part ... Anyway , if you like the game , that 's a good thing ! By all means , game on ! And I don 't mean to persuade people not to try it out . It 's free to play , after all , so if you haven 't tried it you can definitely give it a shot . The basic idea of the game , with heroic team-based fantasy combat , with waves of minions battering away at the enemy , is really good , and I 'm sure it will be re-used and improved upon in the future . This particular version of it , though , is not my cup of tea .

However , I feel as though I can give my thoughts on the game , even if it 's not everything I want to say . I can probably change and add things in the future , since I 'm sure there 's more I can discuss than what I say now . Regardless . Hollow Knight . What do I think of it ? Personally , I can say I enjoyed this A LOT . Well , why is that ? There are a multitude of reasons . One of which is the design of the world . What I mean is that most areas are interconnected with one another , while using shortcuts to traverse the levels more quickly . The actual connections between the many areas of the game are something I greatly enjoy and admire . However , the design of individual areas isn 't as great . Some rooms are desgined well , making use of your abilities to traverse , but many of the areas are long corridors or box shaped rooms with enemies lurking around . This isn 't a bad thing , and there are locations that offer more than just that (The White Palace in particular ), but it does cause some areas to feel similar to one another . In addition , some other areas of the game are small with very little to do or see . The Ancient Basin and The Hive are two areas that immediately come to mind . Bosses however , are solid across the board . There are over 20 of them , and with a few exceptions , are challenging in terms of moveset , and of good quality . There are a few medicore bosses , one of which disappointed me greatly after its excellent introduction that gives off the impression it 's a creature not to be messed with (its very easy for reasons I don 't want to explain ) . Some bosses are also re-used , but it 's done through a re-match of sorts that alters some of their moveset and speed , making them different enough from their original fights to still be engaging to the player . Something else I like are the abilties and how you use them . A lot of classic abilites are here : Double Jump , Wall Jump , Dash , etc . They 're not really interesting or creative . However , they are used quite well in the design of the game , as well as being helpful in combat , which Hollow Knight places a high emphasis on . Customization is another thing I like . Hollow Knight has " charms " , items that alter aspects of your character . These include things like increased health and damage , but also allows things like summoning helpers to aid you in battle , a defensive shield , fater chagre times for certain actions , increased movement , and more . Not only that , but these charms can be used in conjunction with other charms , enhancing the effects of the charms and in some cases , changing your attacks entirely . This allows for experimentation to see what you like to use . And with 40 charms to choose from , there 's a lot of potential . As for real negative issues , I do have a few . I briefly went into areas being samey in terms of design and some bosses being mediocre . One issue I have is the beginning . The first few hours are very restrictive , with only one real path to follow until you get an abilty to wall jump . After that point , the world of Hollow Knight opens up significantly and becomes much more non-linear , allowing you to take multiple paths to go to areas in whatever order you like (with a few exceptions obviously . But , until that point , you really don 't have any choice on where to go . This in and of itself would be fine , except that until you reach that point , you have little in the way of movement options . This coupled with your slow starting speed can make the first few hours of them game feel slow . So yeah , there are things I 'm not fond of in the game . But I think that the positves of the game well exceed whatever shortcomings it may have . The game is also only $15, even without sales or discounts . At that price , I can say its a very easy game to reccomend . Plenty of quality content for its low price tag .
842,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/howieantonio/recommended/356570,howieantonio,356570,Fantastic Game , I love the Art style and the soundtrack is fantastic . I played this game many moons ago when it was first introduced (on gamejolt i believe ) and now it 's on steam i couldn 't ask for anything more . I really had fun playing this game the levels were interesting and the story was a nice touch even though the voice acting was a little corny . The controls are simple to use but the one stipulation i have where sometimes the stab animation is a little wonky when you try to kill specific people in a crowd . The different killers is another thing i really enjoy because each one has a very unique play style . Main problem i have with this game is that sometimes the achievements don 't pop even when i complete them and i found that specific ones like finish a level in under 3 mins only activates on only the mission that come before the boat party . Other than that i highly recommend getting this game and look forward to what the developers of this game are going to put out next . 8/10.

The 2nd problem come from the face of the DLC there is so much and to buy all 0f it is like almost 200 freaking dollars , now I do recommend this game but I had to state 2 major flaws oh and one last thing some of the DLC 's have mixed reviwes so you might want to be carful and hope to not waste your money on a DLC you hate .

Those problems seemed to almost completely go away with the developers suggestion of updating GPU drivers , MSVC ++ and Windows . The remainder of the freezing problems would actually go away after simply waiting for 2 minutes and , despite that windows stated the program had stopped responding , the window would go away and the game would resume . Problems solved ... well , enough for me to enjoy the game at least ... And I DID enjoy it . It 's absolutely fantastic . It 's rare that a game is put together that feels so solid and consistent in terms of gameplay and art design , and it 's even more rare where a city builder ties into a decent (albeit nebulous ) story line . The gameplay itself took me a few tries to figure out the do 's and don 't's in order to keep people from freezing / starving / revolting , and then the challenge of actually finishing the scenarios and their bonus objectives presented itself . I 've got to say , the challenge is severe , and the game is extraordinarily unforgiving , but it 's very rewarding when you clear a scenario , and especially so when you clear a scenario plus its bonus objectives . Highly recomend , and extremely excited to see more content for this spectacular piece of art .

854,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/progenito/recommended/558420,progenito,558420,This series is freaking awesome . Compelling , suspenseful , creepy : everything you 'd want in a horror game . Best of all , it actually had a coherent story . I 've been looking for a similar title ever since finishing this one , since it 's quite short , but nothing compares .
855,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fathobbit/recommended/241930,fathobbit,241930,While this game is flagged as a " Open World " and " RPG " the game itself , to me , is a lot more a non-stop Action game , with combat more reminiscent of the Batman and Assassin 's Creed games . I was disappointed at first thinking this would be more in the vein of Skyrim and other open world RPG 's, but with a Middle Earth spin . There is no looting , no crafting , and no spells (in the sense of a mage / healer etc ). After getting over my initial disappointment (and frustration at myself for not reading about the game more before purchasing ) I found the it does action like no other game I have played and it quickly hooked me . From the start you get a basic tutorial that is part of the opening story and then are mostly left to fend for yourself . It was a little frustrating for me to start , as jumping straight into the fray I quickly aggroed half of Mordor 's orcs and died . You get used to picking your battles to start and as you increase in power becoming a little less picky about which battles you run into . It also continues introducing new combat elements right into the 2nd half of the game , which gives you a lot of new ways to kill the " filthy orcss " The game does have ability trees and runes for your weapons , as well as other abilities you can purchase with the in game currency Miriam , which you can get a number of different ways . The way you get these really give your character the feeling that you are growing in power constantly . By the end it is not the question of whether you should engage in the battle , but whatever gruesome / stylish way you can kill all these orcs . And there are a lot of them . The game balances the dagger , sword and bow aspects of it really well , and switching between each one during battles is easy and satisfying . Saying that you could play the majority of the game focusing on one aspect of it if you wanted too . It also has a lot of lore about Middle Earth , such as people , places , herbs , items etc . The Nemesis system is great , and orcs that kill you can become Captains and eventually Warchiefs . You can either help or hinder this as you see fit . I sometimes found that specific orcs were harder to kill depending on their randomised abilities , and it was fun to hinder their recruitment missions , feasts etc until I was at a stage that I could beat them . All in all Shadow of Mordor is a great game and well worth purchasing .

I thought that we were friends But we can 't make amends I trusted you but all you did Was break my heart and spit on me Not to mention you scared a girl That I was hitting on before You should 've been more honest Perhaps I didn 't care that much You were the best of friends But in the end I took the blame I thought of spending time With Natsuki by my side We made a promise to one another To have fun with none other than each other Read manga , bathe in the sun But someone let us down - Then our Yuri came to town And of course to ruin our fun , She desired it the most We weren 't even close ! I don 't know where she came from But that girl is insane , though . I swear I 'm not to blame When she sneaks a peek of me Do you want a piece of me ?

Monika , sweet Monika You sound like my harmonica Your smile is wide and bright As warm as a sunlight I find it rather suspicious That a girl like you have no issues Perfect , smart , no tissues Here are the brains and here 's a heart Playing the piano Running late for class Pretending to be kinder than you actually are You 're mystical and egotistical For doing what you want Not listening to one soul But one day you will learn Your world does not revolve Around you anymore I 'm sorry I must go I got my life , you know I hope you understand I shall visit you again When universes collide And all that left is to die I 'll be there by your side Bye bye , dear Literature Club I shake my head and give a shrug This is my last goodbye You 'll always be A part of me That I will not despise .

On one hand , Kathy Rain 's story is interesting , and the game was essentially made by a single guy (other than art and voice acting ) which deserves praise , in my opinion . On the other , it 's really short and easy . There aren 't many locations or items , none of these are hard to spot / find , you always know what to do next and your character , Kathy , often gives you heavy hints even when you face very easy problems . Personally , I like harder Adventure games , even though that often means presenting players with somewhat illogical puzzles (Goblins 1-3 come to mind ... they 're old , but a must-play for fans of the genre , BTW ). In Kathy Rain , I only got stumped in one puzzle ( Safe ) but that was mostly me being stupid . One other got me thinking for more than a minute . Another one was easy , but somewhat interesting . The rest of them was just plain obvious . If you 're looking for an easy ride and / or a fairly interesting story , Kathy Rain should do the trick . If you want a challenge , it won 't. Either way , get it for 5 bucks or so , since it lasts only 4-5 hours (unless you wanna go after the Hidden Achievements ... apparently I only found 1 out of 15 ). As long as you know what you 're getting into and don 't pay too much , you won 't be disappointed .
860,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/IgorDotNinja/recommended/42680,IgorDotNinja,42680,Game was great , and multi was awesome BUT i havent played for a while , and this year , i downloaded the multiplayer a couple of times , and every f-ing time i started the game there was always a cheater or more on the server (and im not talking about a better player with really high score or something like that ) But some guy , giving headshots through walls as soon as you spawn , spinning people , spawning everybody on some place on the map in front of him ... (it really sucks ) This last time , a guy was called Clone 1.1 (older dude , i would say 30 + by voice . he was the guy killing everyone on spawn ) and he was saying on the voice chat about how he was angry at the cheaters , and he only wants to ruin games ) Cheaters are mostly in team deathmatch , but less of them are in free for all , i wanted to relax and play some dm . i also encountered a couple of modded servers , which i dont mind if the mod is fun , but sometimes its like , care packages falling everywhere , 100 of them , and everyone can use them ... insane .

862,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hankelios/recommended/435530,hankelios,435530,The combat mechanics were fun in the beginning but grew too repetitive towards the end . The story is vague and confusing , I still have no idea what the game was all about , the ending especially made no sense . There are so many notes to read which I find to be a really lazy way of progressing a story . The game is not terrible by any means , I did have some fun with it . But since you can 't give a " Meh " rating on steam I 'm gonna have to give it a thumbs down .

This is the seventh HOG I 've played so far and it was very enjoyable . Crazy story about a boy who likes to draw and was " pulled into a mist " and lost ever since . His older brother has spent his life trying to find a way to look for him and so the game starts with you playing the older brother who goes in search . Don 't see steam achievements so if that is a big deal then you will have to pass . Main game took me slightly over eight hours to complete but I have noticed that most games take me almost twice as long or slightly less than the average player . Right away you obtain a cute " companion " that helps you along in completing the game . He or she is a little blue thing that does several tasks throughout the game and then looks at you with such an adorable face you want to reach out and pet it and say " good job " . I always found myself giving him a thumbs up whenever he did anything . The HO scenes themselves were quite involved and a delight to work out from the direct item searches to items that needed extra work to make available to highlight . Some of the later were quite involved and a few times I thought I needed help but I was able to work them through to conclusion . The puzzles (not involving HO scenes ) were a mixed bag but none of them were so hard that I needed to skip any . The voice work was good and no one sounded like they phoned it in . When you complete the game there is a bonus game that opens up for you to play . In the extras you can replay all the puzzles and HO scenes and the HO scenes themselves do provide some replay value but you will soon enough grow tired of them but still its a nice touch . There is also a strategy guide you can access by getting out of the game and going into the extras which is cool if you need it but I was able to complete the game without it so if I can do it anyone can . For ten bucks this is a decent buy so go get it .

878,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xRyoden/recommended/344750,xRyoden,344750,This would appear to be the result of someoen giving up on making a game 30% of the way through and then just selling it as is . All the enemies just run strait at you and most of them die in one hit from your 3 spells that are all the same . There doesnt appear to be any health bar or damage indicator but if you let the enemies lazily swing at the air infront of you enough times the game just goes back to the main menu . There may be more depth to enemies and spells later on in the game but I just couldn 't force myself to find out . Also the jump function doesnt work unless you are standing still .

882,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/-_-HEJKAL-_-/recommended/294100,-_-HEJKAL-_-,294100,The game is awesome the concept is great . The game can be seriously hard or you can just play it on easey but if you want some serious challange you can set it on very hard , the game is gonna require you to make hard decisions and you will have a touch time playing it . I recommend it playing it on normal . It seems tobe easey at start but it will get more complicated and hard as you move on . 8/10 Pros + -Theres alot of ways to play this game for example you can be a bandit fraction where youre pretty much raiding bases , camps and villages just being the bad guy in a short way OR you can be a peacefull fraction where youre befriending other fractions and telping them in fight OR just doing a bit of both it all depends on you . -It has a random generated world as well the NPCs . -You have lots of possible places to make your base or you can make multiple bases or camps , you can have a base in a forest , snow , jungle and more biomes . You can live in a hill or on a grassland . -The game keeps you bussy all the time . There is always something to do like theres a group of people raiding your base or there a riot it has alot of thing that can suprise you gameplay . Cons - -The game can be stupid sometimes like that some NPCs cant carry stuff like what ?! or you assign your people to do a thing but they wont complete it . Like you assign people to chop wood but they wont do you have to manually click on the NPC and tell him to do it . -Another thing that I hate is the ,,stress meter ,, it can be stupid sometimes like the NPC can be annoyed of silly thing like that they ate off the ground .

I 've started the second playthrough though I 'm going to take a break . I really enjoyed this game on the first run ... Good characters , good story , graphics are ok , music was surprisingly good and overall the gameplay was very solid while pushing the hack-and-slash type together with other genres in a seamless way . The price tag is a bit high , so perhaps wait for it to drop in price a bit , but if you can 't wait to play it I wouldn 't blame you for paying full price .

(Please read on and *THUMBS UP * my review if you agree , please !) You will have your forum account locked till you agree to a WARNING if you stick up for yourself . It is DIRECTLY in violation of the Warframe forum conduct agreement to stick up for yourself . If a chatter posts toxic and antagonising MEME 's or GIFs designed to insult you and you reply to them in ANY form . That toxic chatter can and likely WILL report you . You will be warned for it . So not ONLY will you be harassed by another chatter , but you will be made to feel like an even BIGGER idiot when a moderator locks your account . Do NOT partake in the hostile , toxic and fanboy wasteland that is the Warframe forums . If you post any criticism on the forums , you will be harassed by fanboys and be warned by moderators for telling them off . You appear to have to be so well written and ENTIRELY devoid of ANYTHING that could pose to upset others indirectly to the point of double checking everything you say with a yardstick in case people find it as a loophole to harass you . You can 't sound upset if you post at all . That will be a loophole to harass you , give you life advice and make you feel like a complete idiot . Have a read if you like of the absolute trash that follows making a valid post about being upset : <url> Instead of a moderator coming into the discussion and being helpful , normal , logical and unbiased ... Maybe just partaking in a conversation , reading if things are valid and checking the sources of hostility or insults and dealing with them as they come ..... Instead of that ... I get harassed and have to stick up for MYself because THEY wouldn 't do it for me ... Then I got a Warning for it . I don 't get their logic at all ....This is what happens when you give biased Fanboys moderator access . You need an unbiased moderator !! This is not what I encountered at all . This particular moderator allowed a post to remain intact after it was reported by me ... A post that referred to another thread and outlined me in it . I thought it was against the rules to refer to other posts in order to attempt to defame someone . So if that 's allowable to refer to me then : The moderator 's name is " Letter13 " . He condemned another moderator as invalid due to being Polish . He is entirely unprofessional and should have his moderator access revoked for his toxic behaviour and acceptance of my harassment . I made a thread that one moderator seemed happy to post in . May I also state that this thread became a flame grounds from other chatters to harass me . I had to report a post which had a youtube link of someone portrayed as having down syndrome which was designed to make fun of me , there were various other taunts and some idiot who posted a dancing salt shaker of which he claimed in private chat to me was to " liven the mood " . His justification was that everyone else was doing it so why not him . There is still the post of someone giving me a golden award . This post has been reported and still remains within the thread . The post that is referring to another thread I was involved in . <url> Then " Letter13 " came along and locked the thread with a post that was virtually devoid of any relevance . This post was designed to make me look like a complete idiot and shut me down when clearly the conversation was valid criticism . Another moderator , as I said ... Took place in the conversation . But he was over-ruled by " Letter13 " because he was a Polish moderator . Is this an insult to his English ? He seemed to have perfectly good English to me . Explain that one " Letter13 " {?} The thread contains everything you need to know about how pathetic DE 's Xmas carol competition was and how insulting it was to other contestants . If you have any form of logic and reality you 'll clearly see why the winner was picked and why it was detrimental to the spirit of competition . Whether you agree or not does really matter , and It 's fine if you don 't agree ... But the opinions on that do NOT pertain to the issue that arose from the discussion that somehow managed to warrant my SECOND forum warning . Why would ANYONE with ANYTHING valid to say want to post if people will just tease them for it . Why would they want to post if the moderators need to be ASKED to do their job when they should be doing it in the first place . Why would we partake in a conversation where sticking up for ourselves is condemned due to terribly illogical forum rules ... If 2 people are involved in a dispute , it 's not always a case of " Both just as bad as each other " . Who is the instigator , where is the cause . Be just in your decisions to moderate otherwise you 're just going to alienate people who never had any malicious intent IN FAVOR of toxic individuals like the ones that you are protecting . Clearly this chatter I was in an argument with posed absolutely ZERO constructivity and was malicious in his intent . Yet I was the one who had my account locked . Please explain your logic with that one ? There is none . You can 't. Hide behind rule loopholes in order smash anyone out of the forums who has an sort of criticism or complaint . Warframe is NOT a perfect game . It has many , MANY flaws ... And you will likely not see this till you get more deeply involved . This game will suck you into the vastness of it and until you reach a point of seeing these huge gaping flaws in the gameplay and in some aspects of the official community ... Then you may not understand . I have soaked up a lot of hours into this game only to hit this enourmous brick wall in content that puts all your efforts at a stand still . Start KUVA farming and try re-roll your collection of RIVEN Mods and then tell me that this game isn 't just a MASSIVE time gated nightmare . Don 't say I didn 't warn you . Instead of fixing these core issues , we are given more boring Eidolons to kill in a place that is barren and void of any character or life . (The forum discussions and conversations were recorded onto Video today ) I am no longer playing this game due to various issues . The developers need to work on their community management and start paying attention to core issues that plague the " End game " content . Ignoring these issues and continuing to work on future content . I will change my review if I get an apology . The game issues still stand though .
891,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SkahYoonk/recommended/22320,SkahYoonk,22320,Absolutely amazing game if you love exploring and can really get into the lore ... but , if you 're more used to the more modern elder scrolls (or games like dark souls ), just be aware that the combat mechanics in this game are VERY dated , as in , even when you are right next to an enemy , you still have a chance of missing . Still , if you can find the game for cheap , it 's definitely worth purchasing . That said , while the game is perfectly playable vanilla , you should probably go look up some mods such as MGE XE or Morrowind Overhaul in order to add in a few more modern graphical effects . Update : Still like it

Possibly a theme of this standout title , certainly a theme of this review . Simple things , like the option to remap keys , can be the difference between an exceptional title , which this is , and a perfect one , which this is not . Kontrol kludge obscures what is otherwise a narrative tour de force . Could I have been even a little less preoccupied with distinguishing between pulling out a flashlight and hiding in the shadows , it would have elevated the experience from the excellent to the sublime . As an old school gamer , it 's a title like this that restores my faith in the potential of the art form to push the limits of the craft of storytelling to new heights . If I tried a beer as good as this game is , I 'd want all my friends to try it . If you haven 't aleady , please , play this game .

I started this game long time ago somewhere 2012 with russian closed beta . you know you enter a game first time you dont know nothing about it and you still have some good feeling that you will playit . As days pass i became bigger and bigger level , i get much better weapons , equipments ,vests. Coop : Coop is pretty ordinary and basic ,its a main core of this game and also bring you posibility to earn some cash and exp . There is 4 classes rifleman , medic , sniper , enginer , bots are pretty stupid ( i mean for a player with 2000 hours you just rush trough them ) Back in 2013-2014 dunno really coop mission give you so much money (not litteraly so much but it was possible to play without vip back then ) so much exp and vp . Much biger challenge is insane even for veteran players . Bots got instant Aimbot specially CQB one , they manage to headshot you with shotgun from great distance . but harder mission , better rewards . Survival : 2014 somewhere that year , They introduce tower raid or maybe before dunno really it was long time ago . That mission was first survival mission that test our skills , knowledge of teamwork or etc . Back day completing tower raid all floor you can get 11k wf dollars and about 14k xp (without vip ) today 1400 wf dollars and less then 3400 xp . Marathon : marathon is a great team bassed mission its last for hour and a half but that mission really test skills from every player . if you goona play marathon you need to give 110% from your class its a pure skilled survival . Zombie : who ever love this except for farming challenges ? Anubis anubis was a pretty refreshing one . it wasnt so hard and give pretty decent rewards . i mean egypt themed map and sand ^^ perfect ! eartshaker : also a great map turret mechanics showed for the first time wow we fail it so manny times :D VERSUS : when i joined clan Balkan United i started to play versus pretty much every day . Versus ... oh that warface versus ... this must be worst pvp experience in my life . Red ping no hit mark ,teleporting russians , aimboters . I never see such a bad hit detection that depends on enemy ping . I mean when you shoot red pinger you only see blood no hit marker and he kill you at the and . Killing behind walls , random headshots , snipers are {?} t , maps are so small for sniping class , i mean everyone can pick sniper ran around with him and making kills . Only in warface you can be so light weight with sniper its a really easy class . BIG dislike for versus . This is first game where you shoot someone , he hit the floor ,shoot him again , you get marker ,and third time you kill him or he escape . {?} ing titan vests . I NEVER SEEN SUCH A GAME WHERE BIG PING GOT BETTER HIT DETECTION . Worst servers ever poor p2p connection . Im really glad i didint buy a single stuff with real money but i actualy make a profit . When auction house showed up i sold my veteran rifle karkom snr for 7500 kredits witch is about 50 euros worth of kredits . poor crytek :D. Indeed it was a great game in one period it got ruined by lazy developers that wont listen at all . its a best free2play game with pretty good weapon handling and you almost feel like you play ordinary payed game that was made from like 600 people . good thing about this wurfus game is i meet so manny people . And after mycom migration i dont think warface got bright future . big dislike for mycom a company that only have dead games . Rip english ... i should sleep and im writing review . cheers .

The Mountain is constantly changing and metamorphosing . When you stop wanting it to be more than what it is , it blossoms into its own experience . And what it is , is more virtual plant , than anything else ; is that a bad thing ? Read on ! full review . If you let it , the Mountain can be a soothing and relaxing experience if you need 5-10 minutes (taken) away from your life . It 's a slowly spinning Mountain in Space . You can zoom out to see nearby galaxies and star clusters , or zoom in to fill your view with the mountain and the surrounding atmosphere . There are so many variables that change and the changes / additions appear every 30 seconds or so , it has enough to keep your eyes trained and your mind engaged in thought . In a nutshell : if you enjoy sitting on a bench watching nature around you (e.g., the ocean , a coast , a forest , a vista ), then you will enjoy this experience . But understand that virtual-mountain-in-space-watching is the only experience it can innately provide you . Anything else you experience , is a result of where your thoughts and your psyche take you . And that 's Zen . :) The Mountain does nothing in particular , but does it very well . PROS +Beautiful scenery / lighting effects +Soothing audio effects +Striking day / night cycle +Well-done weather and season cycles +Occasional random or pseudo-inspirational captions +Occasional random object collisions (some can be quite funny ) +Some interactivity (POV, musical keys ) CONS -You have to pay for it -Surprisingly resource intensive -wtf , ALT-F4 is how you close it ?

904,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kurouka/recommended/359310,kurouka,359310,This game is NOT like Evoland 1. This is a full , complete game that makes use of the genre-switching in creative ways , incorporating it into the story and puzzles . The story has surprised me at how well written it is , and it keeps " evolving " the longer you play - It seems like a typical story at first , but it grows into a touching adventure . The game itself can be well described as a true " adventure " . You travel around the world and through time , experiencing many things and fighting many evil guys . In a sense , this game has several " last bosses " throughout the story , so it 's not a fully linear game about beating the bad guy . Most importantly , this game is FUN . It 's VERY FUN to play , and I have thoroughly enjoyed it . The jump from Evoland to Evoland 2 is like going from a portal demo to Portal 2

This whole game is mediocre , Everything is average . It tries to do horror at several points in the game , but fail at even that . It 's a boring game with minimal effort put into it There 's a gamebreaking glitch at the end of the game , you have to take an elevator but if you don 't limit the FPS to 30 in the config , you 'll fall throught the elevator into a void and die . Amazing . To fix this glitch , go to : " C :\Users\<User Name >\Documents\My Games \Legendary\PandoraGame\Config" Open " PandoraEngine .ini" with notepad Find " MaxSmoothedFrameRate =300" and change it to " MaxSmoothedFrameRate =30" Once you hit a new checkpoint you can exit the game , change it back to 300 and play again
907,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PrussianPirate/recommended/227760,PrussianPirate,227760,It 's good for what it is ! I prefer Victoria 2 over this (and all other Pdx ' titles ) and can also see why people think this game stands no chance against EU4. However , March of the Eagles focuses on a rather short time period around the Battle of Waterloo 1815. So don 't expect too much ! So what is this game ? Maybe it doesn 't convince as much in terms of Grand Strategy as other Paradox titles , but it has a good potential and the military aspect is well done . So the huge contra is that PDS simply abandoned this game and left it with all the flaws :-(
908,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fr0sent_Lucifer/recommended/47870,fr0sent_Lucifer,47870,The key idea of the new game is to provide racing fans with a full-fledged driving experience for guardians of the order . At the disposal of the cops there is a whole car park . The game has two parallel developing campaigns : one for the offender , the other for the cop . The assignments are given out unintentionally , and it is necessary to play alternately for both sides . Here , it seems , the plot from the film " The Departed " about the policeman under cover and the criminal in the skin of the cop appeared , but it does not exist . Absolutely . You just go through the mission , and everything : there are no movies , no heroes . All other components of the classic NFS-set , however , on the spot . Chic licensed cars - there is , asphalt - shines , repetitions of accidents - show . However , online to think about all this somehow do not want to . There are exactly two reasons . The first and most obvious - to travel with living people is trivial more interesting , especially in a mode where up to eight people play cat and mouse policemen at once . But the most interesting (the second reason ) - after the arrival of the internal social network Autolog vigilantly calculate all your successes and failures and compare them with the results of friends . This mean system in general closely monitors your game , even in single modes . And if you set a record in some particularly difficult time trial , do not rush to rejoice : as soon as one of your friends breaks the record , Autolog will not slow you down about it . And at the same time will offer to join any race in which your friends participate . The only nuance is that Autolog is useless if you suddenly have no friends - with whom you can skate here still do not give . <url> <url>

They patched it over the past year to add a higher difficulty . I checked this out and got into 8 minute sword fights with the orcs and loved it .

913,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Munithe/recommended/307670,Munithe,307670,this game is a nice tactical game its kinda similar to xcom 2 or shadowrun in terms of gameplay but its set in the old west so the guns are really crappy like most the guns wont hit and sometimes it gets a little boring with how many turns it takes to win when guns just dont hit their targets so as a game comapred to xcom2 i will give it only a 6/10 it gets an extra point for the sheer inventory of available weapons and gear which are all true to the period though some of them have unnnecesarry stats and features like why have 2 weapons that do the exact same thing instead of giving one a unique feature to separate it from the other this is something that happens but a lot of the guns and gear have unique features to separate them so its not entirely bad where this game shines though is in its narrative the gameplay isnt as good as xcom2 but the narrative is so awesome the game is about men from the old west who sold their soul to the devil for power wealth and glory and now they desperately cling to the strands of hope to reclaim their souls doing the devil 's bidding of course they cant get their souls back but the narrative is well written and voice acted and it characterises the mentalitiy of the old west very well i would say if you are into games like xcom2 and you are looking for a decent VN (visual novel ) then play this game because it is like a visual novel version of xcom2 the gameplay is there but its not all there but the narrative is there in full form and if you like dirty western stuff you will like this

The gameplay is awesome , the customization of the ships is great for choosing which arsenal of weapons you like best , and the story ... one of the greatest plots I have ever seen . When you are learning Sage macros , it truly feels like you are in the most sacred , mystic place on the universe , and you have full control of every single molecule . And the plot twists ... the feelings are strong in some points of the game . The ending , in combination with the credits song , brought tears to my eyes . Oh , and that was only for the single player mode ! This game has multiplayer too , which I have yet to try out ! 10/10 , would play again to beat the campaign on a harder difficulty .?
925,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/juggerbunny/recommended/635390,juggerbunny,635390,First of all let me say that I actually really like the game , my only issue with the game are the game breaking bugs and the camera . The game had a good start but slowly from Volume 2 onwards I started to notice issues with the game . The fixed camera system and while I don 't mind it as I view it as a 2.5D game , I would expect to atleast be able to pan the camera around a bit as not having the ability to do so is incredibly cumbersome for a stealth game and having the bars on the side are not a good replacement as you cannot tell how far someone is from you , whether they are walking away from you or standing still etc . I noticed a few bugs where the game would get stuck on loading screen . There 's one persistent bug i .e. the game never quits and I have to ctrl +alt+del everytime . Additionally , game doesn 't allow for overlays from Geforce experience , DSR doesn 't seem to work either . ------SPOILER for Volume 4------ Then here 's the worst part , Volume 4 has lots of bugs . I started noticing at the start in the party that NPCs would get locked in a behaviour loop and it 'd change if I was near them . In the bank section itself I 've noticed a game breaking bug where I cannot get inside the objective area because there is an NPC that always stands next to the keycard reader looking at it and doesn 't move at all . Then there 's another NPC that talks to the receptionist but the moment I move near the keycard reader he will stop his conversation and immediately turn towards the door and stand next to it . ANd he would not move an inch from there until I get far away . Once I do that he goes back to his previous behaviour loop of chatting with the receptionist but again as soon as I start nearing the door the same thing happens and he prevents me from going inside . I got around this but quickly running around the lobby to attract guards towards me and quickly get in , but onc eI was in I noticed another bug where the person who was suppose to come and I was suppose to hide from ...never came in . Until she popped up instantly for 2 seconds from the floor and then disappeared . Then I got stuck while trying to move the ladder . Reloading checkpoint doesn 't help because the bug seems to be everpresent in the save file itself . All of this could potentially be avoided if the game allowed for manual saving and separate save files rather than relying on one single save file that can only be autosaved . Basically I 've played the game for 7 hours and I can 't even refund it and it doesn 't look like this will get fixed as the game 's been out for several months now and it 's from a small developer . Extremely disappointed because the game had potential and was quite fun even when it worked !!

Main complaint would be the seemingly limitless range of enemy combatants ' weaponry (pistols firing and hitting across the map ), which doesn 't make sense since player 's agents have to obey the range rules of various weapons they have at their disposal . Would be looking forward for a patch about it . Launch day review : 7/10 Potential : 9/10

If you 're looking for a race game both original and giving you adrenaline , then this game will suit you . The only bad points are you cannot edit keys which is pretty annoying and the lack of more maps which results in a more boring game . The main objective would basically be to upgrade the engine again and again until you win a 3 star race . Well , that disappointed me . I just play for fun , not for competition . However , if you are looking for something relaxing , than opt for it . I still recommend it because it 's good overall .
942,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hangedman/recommended/603960,hangedman,603960,Monolith is an excellent little gem , well polished . A room combat roguelite shmup (closest reference point is Isaac , although it feels vastly different ), it offers a ton of unlocks and surprises , lots of variety in rooms and secrets , allows for a ton of playstyles , and just looks and sounds and feels excellent all-round . The pixel art is just really nice , very readable , chunky and with a great colour palette . I highly recommend it for both entry-level and maniakku players , cause it can get weird fast .

944,1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hentai_priest/recommended/269210,hentai_priest,269210,I am giving this game a positive review , and a recommended rating , but there 's a catch . A huge one . I don 't really know what particular game I am reviewing . Since its release in 2014 Hero Siege recieved (suffered?) so many updates and patches that it is no longer the game we were buying back then . Oh , for crying out loud , it even isn 't the game we were playing last week ! It has seen gameplay design shifts , map edits , character wipes , skill swaps , class nerfs , you name it . Astonishingly , after all of these changes , it is once again unbalanced as hell . We loved it . We hated it . We tried to leave . We came back . Why ? I guess because at its core it 's still a fun and , I dare say , meditative experience . Because it 's a great co-op game . Because you just can 't beat Elias Viglione 's pixel art . Therefore , yes . Recommended . Positive . I just hope that it won 't have time to become a totally different game again , while I am writing this .

When people DONT {?} on the roles that a team should have , theyre either stupid or just suck ...sometimes even all of them . Communication is mostly non existent and everybody thinks is right . Russians who manage to disconnect in almost every game , brits who are toxic for no reason and mostly suck even more than the rest ...its just {?} t and when you have a 5 game losing streak because you keep getting the same guys over and over again in your team and they still dont care or make any effort to win , feed , take the carries farm , dont know how to support (stack, harass and help your carry , how hard can that be ...) or even dont care at all you just want to quit on this game . When your team is down by at least 50 kills after 20 mins you always get those wannabe rockys in your team who refuse to give up and waste the next 5 mins getting {?} the same way as the 20 mins before , its just insane . Oh and almost forgot , you also get sent to low prio when you have multiple {?} who fit in all of those patterns above in your team reporting you , isnt that great ?

967,-1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/WeaponizedGrapefruit/recommended/717690,WeaponizedGrapefruit,717690,Honestly ? This game is an empty , awful , frustrating , and buggy mess . For the laughable 50 dollars you paid for this game , you get 10 missions , However , There 's a camp defense mission which gets re-used 3 times , and even more for side missions , and there 's a big mission in a mall , Which gets re-used for another mission aswell , and for side missions . So in reality , you only get 7 missions . There 's simply just no content . It 's empty . The game just feels very empty , Has no endgame whatsoever , Even though , according to OVERKILL it does , since they consider a weekly mission and daily bounties for useless resources " endgame " Oh yeah , and for all the warframe players out there , Or destiny players , for that matter , there 's a roaming trader that is apparantly very similar to X ?r or Baro Ki 'Teer. You need to find him in a random mission every week , and when you rescue / extract him from that mission , he goes to your camp and opens up his shop to you , in this game he sells you 3 weapons , every week , BUT , its all RNG based , sometimes he sells good gear , sometimes it 's trash , in the 3 weeks that the game has been out , i 've only seen trash . But i 'm not done yet , All of this is percentage based , And you need to " feed " him either loot or blueprints , loot is acquired by opening crates in game with your designated tools , or blueprints , which are acquired from the daily bounties , or leveling up a character past 30. However it costs an insane amount of blueprints to get a 100% (Basically guaranteed percentage of getting the item at that rarity ) So that 's just not really valid . Feeding him loot is trash aswell , since your vault only has 200 slots , so if you 're a hoarder you can 't really do that . and the fact that the only good way of getting loot with an efficient time investment , is farming the same mission over and over , and even then , it doesn 't even matter , most melee weapons start oneshotting at a certain gearscore , so there 's no need to go further up when you reach a certain gearscore . Same goes for sniperrifles on Grant . There 's also the awful progression , it 's very bland , you don 't ever have to make a choice since when your character reaches level 30 you 'll have all of the skills unlocked . Then , the frustration and the bugs , Honestly , This game is barely playable in its current state , with most bugs revolving around getting stuck , your entire progress getting deleted , and the god awful human AI . I 'll be putting several clips of me experiencing the game being buggy as {?} down below . <url> <-- (Running into sniper fire , blindly .) <url> <-- (He's shooting me while running ) <url> <-- (Getting shot through a wall ) <url> <-- (Getting shot through a wall , again ) <url> <-- (Getting naded through a wall ) <url> <-- (Getting killed by a staggered enemy ) <url> <-- (Teleporting) <url> <-- (Not sure what 's going on here but from what i 'm seeing its locking me out of certain areas ) Overall , The game is very empty , Very buggy , And very stale . Wait for a price drop / sale And wait til the entirety of season 2 is released . Oh yeah and til the gamebreaking bugs are fixed .

This is a really well put together Tower Defense game with great graphics , good sound , some nice characteristation and good voice acting . So far I \'ve played the campaign for a couple of hours . The twist to the normal tower defense game is that you don \'t have towers you have movable heroes with different abilities . Obviously this sounds like moveable towers and to a degree it is but it does make you care about the \" towers \" more , they have personalities and you get to know them . The game itself is one of those properly designed TDs where you have to think about where to place your forces rather than just place lots of \" tower type A \" because it is the best one . The hero upgrade paths are complex and add hugely to the overall enjoyment of the game and upgrades really do make a pretty obvious difference . Overall - Great ! On a par with the best TDs out there .

As expected there are many Rick and Morty quotes and references , one they specify is canon . When compared to the TV series the story telling isnt as smart and gameplay is resolving 4 or 5 puzzles .

I had no interest in the game itself but I got curious about that act that you could do : it wasn 't common . This was the biggest mistake of my life ! I got totally hooked . It 's cute , the characters amusing and distinct with their personalities and best of all : despite being a game where there is violence : you can beat it without any violence from your part . The music is something I like : though it sometimes gets a bit repetitive , I didn 't actually get bored of it ! I don 't think I can do the run where you kill everyone ... There are monsters there that I just can 't kill . I love it for its characters ; the monsters and how it remembers your past actions , and I hate it because I know I can never complete all endings : I could never kill those brothers , I got too attached to them .
